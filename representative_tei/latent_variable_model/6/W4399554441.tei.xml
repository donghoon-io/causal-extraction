<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) have been recently introduced as probabilistic models enjoying the key ingredient behind expressive generative models: continuous latent variables (LVs). PICs are symbolic computational graphs defining continuous LV models as hierarchies of functions that are summed and multiplied together, or integrated over some LVs. They are tractable if LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximated by tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numerical quadrature process, called QPCs. So far, only tree-shaped PICs have been explored, and training them via numerical quadrature requires memory-intensive processing at scale. In this paper, we address these issues, and present: (i) a pipeline for building DAG-shaped PICs out of arbitrary variable decompositions, (ii) a procedure for training PICs using tensorized circuit architectures, and (iii) neural functional sharing techniques to allow scalable training. In extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of functional sharing and the superiority of QPCs over traditional PCs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Continuous latent variables (LVs) are arguably the key ingredient behind many successful generative models, from variational autoencoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to generative adversarial networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and more recently diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. While these models allow to learn expressive distributions from data, they are limited to sampling and require task-specific approximations when it comes to perform probabilistic reasoning, as even simple tasks such as computing marginals or conditionals are intractable for them. On the other hand, performing these tasks can be tractable for (hierarchical) discrete LV models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, but these prove to be more challenging to learn at scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. This inherent trade-off among tractability, ease of learning, and expressiveness can be analyzed and explored with probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a recently introduced class of deep generative models defining hierarchies of continuous LVs using symbolic functional circuits. PICs are tractable when their continuous LVs can be analytically integrated out. Intractable PICs can however be systematically approximated as (tensorized) probabilistic circuits (PCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, the representation language of discrete LV models. An instance of such PCs encodes a hierarchical numerical quadrature process of the PIC to approximate, and as such is called quadrature PC (QPC).</p><p>Distilling QPCs from PICs has proven to be an effective alternative way to train PCs, but it has only been explored for tree-shaped PICs, as building and scaling to richer LV structures is an open research question that requires new tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this paper, we fill this gap by redefining the semantics of PICs and extending them to DAG-shaped hierarchies of continuous LVs. Specifically, we design PICs as a language to represent hierarchical quasi-tensors factorizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, parameterized by light-weight multi-layer perceptrons.</p><p>Contributions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> We present a systematic pipeline to build DAG-shaped PICs, starting from arbitrary variable decompositions (Section 3.1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We show how to learn and approximate PICs via a hierarchical quadrature process which we encode in tensorized QPCs that match certain circuit architectures proposed in different prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> (Section 3.2). (3) We present functional sharing techniques to scale the training of PICs, which lead us to parameterize them with multi-headed multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) requiring comparable resources as PCs (Section 3.3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> In extensive experiments (Section 4), we show that (i) functional sharing proves remarkably effective for scaling and that (ii) QPCs outperform PCs commonly trained via EM or SGD, while being distilled from PICs with up to 99% less trainable parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Probabilistic integral circuits</head><p>Notation. We denote input variables as X and latent variables (LVs) as Y and Z, with x, y and z as their realization respectively. We denote scalars with lower-case letters (e.g., w ∈ R), vectors with boldface lower-case letters (e.g., w ∈ R N ), matrices with boldface upper-case letters (excluding X, Y, Z, e.g., W ∈ R M ×N ), and tensors with boldface calligraphic letters (e.g., W ∈ R L×M ×N ).</p><p>A probabilistic integral circuit (PIC) c is a symbolic computational graph representing a nonnegative function c(X) = ∫ c(X, z) dz, i.e. c(x) ≥ 0, over observed variables X and continuous latent variables Z. Similar to probabilistic circuits (PCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, PICs have input, sum and product units. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> Different from PCs, however, PICs operate on functions, not scalars, and make use of a new type of unit: the integral unit ∫ , which allows to represent continuous LVs. To satisfy nonnegativity, we parameterize PICs with non-negative functions and positive sum weights, specifically:</p><p>• An input unit u (depicted as in our figures) represents a possibly non-normalized distribution f u (X u , Z u ) → R + , where X u ⊆ X and Z u ⊆ Z;</p><p>• A sum unit u ( + ) outputs a weighted sum of the functions it receives from its input units, i.e.</p><p>g u (X u , Z u ) = Σ i∈in(u) w i g i (X i , Z i ), where in(u) is the set of units u takes as input, w i &gt; 0, X u = ∪ i∈in(u) X i and Z u = ∪ i∈in(u) Z i . Similarly, a product unit u ( × ) outputs the product of its incoming functions, i.e. g u (X u , Z u ) = Π i∈in(u) g i (X i , Z i );</p><p>• Finally, an integral unit u ( ∫ ) encodes an "uncountable weighted sum" whose weights are compactly represented by a function f u (Z u , Y u ) → R + , where ∅ ̸ = Y u ⊆ Z are the LVs that are being integrated out by u, while Z u can potentially be empty, i.e. Z u = ∅. The unit receives a function g i (X i , Y u ) from its only input unit i and outputs the function g u (X i , Z u ) = ∆ f u (Z u , y u ) g i (X i , y u ) dy u , where ∆ = supp(Y u ) is the support of Y u . For instance, an integral unit u with f u ({Z}, {Y }) = 2Z -Y 2 and supp(Y ) = [-1, 1] receiving function g i ({X}, {Y }) = X 2 -3X + 4Y would output g u ({Z}, {X}) = 2 /3 X(X -3)(6Z -1). The output of a PIC c is the output function returned by its root unit u, which is only defined on X, i.e. c(X) = g u (X) and Z u = ∅. Similar to PCs, imposing structural constraints over PICs can unlock tractable inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As such, we assume that (i) all + -units receive functions defined on the same input variables (aka smoothness), and (ii) all × -units receive functions defined over disjoint sets of input variables (aka decomposability).</p><p>PICs are tractable when their LVs can be analytically integrated out, meaning that we can passthrough integral units computing the integration problem they define, eventually outputting a function. Notably, this is possible when LVs are in linear-Gaussian relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> or when functions are polynomials. Intractable PICs can however be approximated via a hierarchical numerical quadrature process that can be encoded as a PC called quadrature PC (QPC). Intuitively, each PIC integral unit can be approximated by a set of sum units in a QPC, each conditioning on some previously computed quadrature values, with a large but finite number of input units <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Materializing a QPC allows to train PICs by approximate maximum likelihood: Given a PIC, gradients to its parameters attached to input, sum and integral units can be backpropagated through the corresponding QPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This also provides an alternative way to train PCs that can rival traditional learners. So far, the construction of PICs has been limited to a simple compilation process from probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> with continuous LVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In a nutshell, the LV nodes of a PGM become integral units of a PIC model, and the PGM (conditional) distributions become the functions f u attached to input and integral units of the PIC, as we illustrate in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. However, the PGM structure needs to be limited to a tree, as to avoid that the hierarchical quadrature process would yield an exponentially large QPC, thus hindering learning. This imposes a semantics for current PICs as simple latent tree models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and clearly limits their expressiveness as more complex LV interactions are not possible. Building more expressive PICs requires reinterpreting this semantics and introducing new tools, which we do next.</p><p>3 Building, learning and scaling PICs</p><p>In Section 3.1, we systematize the construction of DAG-shaped PICs, showing how to build them starting from arbitrary variable decompositions, going beyond the current state-of-the-art <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Then, in Section 3.2, we show how to learn and approximate such PICs with QPCs encoding a hierarchical quadrature process, retrieving PC architectures proposed in prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Finally, in Section 3.3, we present (neural) functional sharing, a technique which we use to parameterize PICs as to make their QPC materialization fast and cheap, allowing scaling to larger models and larger datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Building PICs from arbitrary variable decompositions</head><p>Standard PCs can be built according to established pipelines that allow to flexibly represent arbitrary variable decompositions, as well as rich discrete LV interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. In the following, we derive an analogous pipeline for PICs that allows to take care of continuous LVs, going beyond their current tree-shaped semantics (Section 2) yet allowing to perform hierarchical quadrature without blowing up the size of the materialized QPCs. To do so, we start by formalizing the notion of hierarchical variable decomposition, or region graph, out of which we will build our PIC structures. Definition 1 (Region Graph (RG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). An RG R over input variables X is a bipartite and rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are either regions, denoting subsets of X, or partitions, specifying how a region is partitioned into other regions (Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>).</p><p>RGs can be (i) compiled from PGMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, (ii) randomly initialized <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, (iii) learned from data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, or (iv) built according to the data modality (e.g. images) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. If we compile from a tree PGM, as in (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the resulting RG will be a tree, thus yielding a tree-like PIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Our pipeline, detailed in Algorithm 1, takes an arbitrary DAG-shaped RG as input, and can deliver DAG-like PICs. Without loss of generality, we assume to have an RG R which only allows for (i) binary partitionings of regions (i.e. all product units will have two input units) and (ii) univariate leaves, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a). Our construction iteratively builds a PIC in a bottom-up fashion, associating regions to PIC units. For every leaf region X u ∈ X in R, we instantiate an input unit u with function f u ({X u }, {Z u }), where Z u ∈ Z is an arbitrary continuous LV (Line 8, Algorithm 1). Such functions can be univariate conditional densities, i.e. p u (X u |Z u ), resembling small VAE-like decoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> amenable to be numerically integrated.</p><p>Once all leaf regions have been processed, we move to the inner ones. Let X ⊆ X be an inner region partitioned in</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N ≥ 1 different ways as {(X (n) 1 , X (n) 2 )} N n=1 , i.e. (X (n) 1 ∩X (n) 2 ) = ∅ and (X (n) 1 ∪X (n) 2 ) = X for every n. For each partition (X (n) 1 , X (n)</formula><p>2 ), we will merge the PIC units associated to regions X (n)  1 and X (n) 2 using consecutive applications of product and integral units-as we explain nexteventually associating a unit the partition itself. One can design such merging as desired, as long as smoothness and decomposability are not violated. Finally, in case N = 1, we associate to X the unit associated to its only partition, otherwise, in case N &gt; 1, we merge the N units associated to each n-th partition using a sum unit which we then associate to X (Line 6, Algorithm 1).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: The pipeline presented in this paper: RG → PIC → QPC → folded QPC. Starting from a (fragment of) a DAG-shaped region graph (a), we build a DAG-like PIC via Algorithm 1 using Tucker-merge (b). Then, we materialize a tensorized QPC encoding a hierarchical quadrature process via Algorithm 3, using K = 2 quadrature points, which we fold to allow faster inference (d).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Algorithm 1 RG2PIC(R) Input RG R over variables X Output PIC c(X) = c(X, z)dz 1: U ← map()</formula><p>▷ from regions to PIC units 2: for each region X ∈ postOrder(R) do 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">if X partitioned as {(X (n) 1 , X (n) 2 )} N n=1 then 4: ρ ← True if X = X else False 5: S ← {merge(U[X (n) 1 ], U[X (n) 2 ], ρ)} N n=1 6: U[X] ← pop(S) if N =1 else + ([S]) 7: else ▷ |X| = 1 8: U[X] ← (fu(X, {Zu})) 9: return A PIC with U[X] as root unit Algorithm 2 merge(u 1 , u 2 , ρ)</formula><p>Input Units u1, u2, and boolean flag ρ Output ∫ or × unit u with (u1, u2) as descendants 1: procedure (Tucker-merge)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">▷ Zu 1 ̸ = Zu 2 2: Zu ← ∅ if ρ else {Z} ⊂ Z \ {Zu 1 , Zu 2 } 3: return ∫ ( × ([u1, u2]), fu(Zu, {Zu 1 , Zu 2 })) 4: procedure (CP-merge) ▷ Zu 1 = Zu 2 5: Zu 3 ← ∅ if ρ else {Zu 3 } ⊂ Z \ {Zu 1 } 6: u3 ← ∫ (u1, fu 3 (Zu 3 , {Zu 1 })) 7: Zu 4 ← ∅ if ρ else {Zu 4 } ⊂ Z \ {Zu 2 } 8: u4 ← ∫ (u2, fu 4 (Zu 4 , {Zu 2 })) 9: return × ([u3, u4])</formula><p>Merging PIC units. Let u 1 and u 2 be candidate units to merge, each outputting functions with LV Z u1 and Z u2 respectively. We present two ways of merging units: Tucker-merge and CP-merge, which we detail in Algorithm 2 and whose names will be clearer in the next section. If Z u1 ̸ = Z u2 , we use Tucker-merge: We merge u 1 and u 2 with a product, which is then input to an integral unit u with function f u ({Z u }, {Z u1 , Z u2 }), where Z u ∈ Z \ {Z u1 , Z u2 }. Otherwise, if Z u1 = Z u2 , we use CP-merge: We add two integral units, u 3 with input u 1 and u 4 with input u 2 , which we finally merge with a product. We parameterize unit u 3 (resp. u 4 ) with f u3 ({Z u3 }, {Z u1 }) (resp. f u4 ({Z u4 }, {Z u2 })), where Z u3 ̸ = Z u1 (resp. Z u4 ̸ = Z u2 ). Note that whenever merging two units defined on X, we need to marginalize out the remaining LVs, without introducing new ones. We illustrate the application of Algorithm 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a-b</ref>). Our pipeline generalizes the PICs used in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) as we can build them by just converting latent tree structures in tree RGs and using CP-merge as merging procedure. While we now do not need a PGM to build a complex PIC structure, one could try to reverse-engineer our PICs to retrieve a PGM via decompilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the result would be a very intricate hierarchy over continuous LVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Learning PICs via tensorized QPCs</head><p>Given a DAG-shaped (intractable) PIC, we now show how to approximate it with a tensorized PC encoding a hierarchical quadrature process, namely a QPC. Intuitively, we interpret PICs as to encode a set of quasi-tensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, a generalization of tensors with potentially infinite entries in each dimension corresponding to a continuous LV, which we materialize into classical tensors via quadrature. We begin with a definition of tensorized circuits and a brief refresher on numerical quadrature. Definition 2 (Tensorized Circuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>). A tensorized circuit c is a parameterized computational graph encoding a function c(X) ∈ R, and comprising of input , product × and sum + layers. Each layer consists of many computational units defined over the same variables, and every noninput layer receives vectors as input from one or more layers. Each input layer ℓ is defined on variables X ℓ ⊆ X and computes a collection of K ℓ parametric functions [f k : dom(X ℓ ) → R] K ℓ k=1 , outputting a K ℓ -dimensional vector. Each product layer ℓ computes either an Hadamard product (⊙) or a Kronecker product (⊗) of the vectors it receives from its inputs layers. Specifically, the Hadamard product is an element-wise product of vectors, and therefore applicable when these have same size, while the outer product of two vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u ∈ R N and v ∈ R M is w = u ⊗ v = || N i=1 u i v ∈ R N M</formula><p>, where || is the concatenation operator. Finally, a sum layer ℓ with S ℓ sum units receives inputs from  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>: From functions to sum-product layers via multivariate numerical quadrature (Section 3.2). We illustrate how the 3-variate function f ({Z}, {Y 1 , Y 2 }) (a) can be seen as an infinite (quasi) tensor that we first materialize w.r.t. integration points z as a finite tensor W of size K × K × K (b, Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">2</ref>)), then flatten as a matrix accounting for integration weights w (c, Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">3</ref>)), and finally use to parameterize a Tucker layer (d, Equation (Tucker-layer)).</p><p>N layers {ℓ i } N i=1 and computes the matrix-vector product W|| N i=1 ℓ i (X ℓi ), where W ∈ R S ℓ ×K , K=Σ N i=1 K ℓi , are the sum layer parameters. When N = 1, then it simply computes Wℓ 1 (X ℓ1 ). Numerical quadrature. A numerical quadrature rule is an approximation of the definite integral of a function as a weighted sum of function evaluations at specified points <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Specifically, given some integrand f : R → R and interval ∆ := [a, b], a quadrature rule consists of a set of K integration points z ∈ ∆ K and weights w ∈ R K minimizing the integration error ε</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">K = | ∫ ∆ f (z) dz -Σ K k=1 w k f (z k )|</formula><p>, which goes to zero as K→ ∞. To approximate an integral of an Ndimensional function f , we can phrase the multiple integral as repeated one-dimensional integrals by applying Fubini's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, aka tensor product rule, as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∆ K f (z)dz = ∆ ... ∆ f (z 1 , ..., z N )dz 1 ...dz N ≈ i1∈[K] w i1 ... i N ∈[K] w i N f (z i1 , ..., zi N ).

Given a candidate PIC, we will explore it in post order traversal, and iteratively associate a circuit layer (Definition 2) to each PIC unit, a process that we call materialization. We detail such procedure in Algorithm 3, which essentially applies Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) hierarchically over the PIC units. Each unit encodes a function over potentially continuous and discrete variables, hence representing a quasi-tensor, which we approximate by evaluating it over the quadrature points only, thus materializing a classical tensor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3 (a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>)). We facilitate quadrature by assuming that all PIC LVs have bounded domain ∆ := [-1, 1]. This way, we can always use the same quadrature rule (z, w) for each required (multivariate) approximation, and also simplify treatment and exposition.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Algorithm 3 PIC2QPC(c, z, w) Input PIC c, quadrature rule z, w ∈ R K Output Tensorized QPC 1: L ← map() ▷ from PIC units to layers 2: for each unit u ∈ postOrder(c) do 3: if u is then 4: L[u] ← [ (fu(Xu, Zu=z k )) ] K k=1 5: else if u is ∫ (u1, fu) then 6: L[u] ← W (u) L[u1] via Eq.

We illustrate this process in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3(a-c</ref>). Similarly, we also materialize every PIC sum unit u with weights {w i } N i=1 as a sum layer, but parameterized by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W (u) = || N i=1 w i I K ∈ R K×N K ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where I K is the K ×K identity matrix and || the concatenation operator (Line 8, Algorithm 3). Note that such sum layer can be seen as a mixing layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Finally, consider a PIC product unit u with inputs u 1 and u 2 , each outputting functions with LVs Z u1 and Z u2 respectively. We associate to u an Hadamard product layer if Z u1 = Z u2 , or a Kronecker product layer if Z u1 ̸ = Z u2 , reflecting the fact that we are marginalizing out two different LVs. We summarize our PIC materializationillustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>-in Algorithm 3, where we iteratively associate a PIC unit to a circuit layer, eventually delivering a tensorized QPC. We stress that being QPCs just standard PCs they enjoy their same properties (e.g. tractable marginalization). We will learn PICs via maximizing the likelihood of its QPC materialization.</p><p>QPCs as existing tensorized architectures. Materializing PICs built via Algorithm 1 delivers tensorized PCs with alternating sum and product layers, aka sum-product layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. An instance of such layers is the Tucker layer, used in architectures like RAT-SPNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and EiNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Specifically, a binary Tucker layer ℓ <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> computes</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ℓ(X ℓ ) = W (ℓ 1 (X ℓ1 ) ⊗ ℓ 2 (X ℓ2 )) ,<label>(Tucker-layer)</label></formula><p>where W ∈ R K×K 2 and ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 are input layers of ℓ, each outputting a K-dimensional vector. In contrast, the recent HCLT architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> use the canonical polyadic (CP) layer ℓ</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">[2], i.e. ℓ(X ℓ ) = W (1) ℓ 1 (X ℓ1 ) ⊙ W (2) ℓ 2 (X ℓ2 ) , (CP-layer)</formula><p>where W (1) , W (2) ∈ R K×K . We exactly recover Tucker (resp. CP) layers in our QPCs when these are materialized from PICs built via Tucker-merge (resp. CP-merge) in Algorithm 2, and hence the name of the merging procedure. Therefore, some QPCs can exactly match existent tensorized architectures, and this certainly happens when these are materialized from PICs built via Algorithm 1. This gives a new point of view on traditional tensorized architectures, and new possibilities for representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> illustrates how the materialization of a 3-variate function leads to a Tucker layer. This 1-to-1 mapping between tensorized PC architectures and QPCs will allow for a fair comparison in our experiments.</p><p>Folding tensorized circuits for faster inference. The layers of a tensorized circuit that (i) share the same functional form and that (ii) can be evaluated in parallel, can be stacked together as to create a folded layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> which speeds up inference and learning on GPU by orders of magnitude. For instance, let {ℓ i } F i=1 be F parallelizable Tucker layers each parameterized by a matrix W (i) of size K×K 2 . Such layers can be evaluated as a folded layer ℓ parameterized by a tensor W of size F ×K×K 2 , which computes the-otherwise sequential-F tucker layers in parallel. We illustrate folding in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(d)</ref>, and later on in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(c)</ref>. Note that (i) the input layers sharing the same function form can always be folded and that (ii) although a tensorized circuit may have many types of sum-product layers, using one type only is common in practice, and promotes depth-wise folding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Scaling PICs with neural functional sharing</head><p>Materializing QPCs can be memory intensive and time consuming, depending on: (i) the cost of evaluating the functions we need to materialize, (ii) the degree of parallelization of the required function evaluations, and (iii) the number of integration points K. To solve these issues, we introduce neural functional sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, i.e. we share multi-layer perceptrons as to parameterize multiple PIC units at once. This allows us to scale to larger models and datasets, as we make materialization faster and more memory-efficient than previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. PIC functional sharing. Functional sharing is to PICs as parameter-sharing is to PCs. This type of sharing can be applied over a group of input/integral units-grouped according to some criteriawhose functions have all the same number of input and output variables. Specifically, let γ = Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>: From neural C-sharing to folded CP-layer (Section 3.3). We sketch a 4-headed MLP with Fourier-Features (a) which we use to parameterize a group of 4 integral units (at the same depth) of a PIC (b), whose materialization leads to a folded CP-layer parameterized by a tensor W of size 2 × 2 × K × K (c), with K being the number of integration point. Note that, during materialization, the FF-MLP block in (a) will be only evaluated K 2 times, and not 4K 2 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">{u i } N</formula><p>i=1 be a group of N input/integral units, each with function f i : R I → R O . The simplest form of functional sharing is to set all functions to be equal, i.e. ∀i, j ∈ [N ] : f i = f j . In this way, we reduce the number of function evaluations from N K to K as long as we materialize each f i w.r.t. the same integration points z ∈ R K , which is the case for Algorithm 3. We call this type of sharing F-sharing, as per full-sharing. More interestingly, leveraging functional composition, we may define f i = h i • f , so as sharing an inner function f for all unit functions. Similarly as before, as long as we materialize each f i w.r.t. the same quadrature points z ∈ R K , we would only need K function evaluations for f instead of N K, as we can share them with all outer functions h i for further evaluation. We call this type of sharing C-sharing, as per composite-sharing. The original implementation of PICs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> used neither F-sharing nor C-sharing.</p><p>Finally, we present and apply two different ways of grouping units. The first consists of grouping all input units, a technique which is only applicable when all input variables share the same domain. With this grouping, coupled with F-sharing, we would only need to materialize K × P parameters, and use them to parameterize every QPC input layer. The second consists of grouping all integral units at the same depth of the PIC structure, which we couple with C-sharing and materialize as a folded sum-product layer. Despite grouping units that materialize into a folded layer is a natural and convenient choice, note that we can also group units that do not materialize as such. Once all units in a PIC have been grouped, materialization can be performed per-group.</p><p>PIC functional sharing with (multi-headed) MLPs. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we parameterize PIC input and integral units with light-weight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). However, instead of using a single MLP for each function, we will apply functional sharing as we strive to make the QPC materialization faster and memory efficient. Specifically, consider a group of integral units γ = {u i } N i=1 , each with function f i : R I → R, over which we want to apply functional sharing. For every group γ, we would have an L + 1 layered MLP of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ϕ (γ) : R I → R M := ϕ (γ) L • • • • • ϕ (γ) 1 • FF,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where FF : R I → R M is a Fourier-feature layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and each ϕ (γ) i</p><p>: R M → R M is a standard linear layer followed by an element-wise non linearity ψ, i.e. ψ(Az + b), with A ∈ R M ×M , b ∈ R M , and M being the size of the MLP. Applying F-sharing over γ would simply consist of setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">f i : R M → R := softplus(h (γ) • ϕ (γ) + b (γ) ), (neural F-sharing)</formula><p>where h (γ) ∈ R M and b (γ) ∈ R are group-dependent parameters, therefore making all functions in the group equal. Instead, to implement C-sharing, we parameterize each f i as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">f i : R M → R := softplus(h (i) • ϕ (γ) + b (i) ), (neural C-sharing)</formula><p>where h (i) ∈ R M and b (i) ∈ R are function-dependent parameters, effectively creating a multiheaded MLP. As an example, consider a folded CP-layer with F = 500 and K = 512-which we actually used in practice-resulting in 2F K 2 ≈ 262M trainable parameters. Assuming no bias term, an MLP with L = 2 and M = 256 would only instead require LM 2 + 2F M ≈ 387K trainable parameters to materialize the same tensor, resulting in more than 99% less trainable parameters. We illustrate such C-sharing in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. In Appendix C.1 we provide more details about our MLPs.  Fast &amp; memory-efficient QPC materialization. Combing PIC functional sharing and per-group materialization allows scaling the training of PICs via numerical quadrature, as we drastically reduce the number and the cost of function evaluations required for the QPC materialization. We can now materialize very large QPCs, matching the scale of recent over-parameterized PCs yet requiring up to 99% less trainable parameters when using a large K. This was not possible in the original formulation of PIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as (i) the entire QPC was materialized in one-shot, not per-group, and (ii) no functional sharing was implemented, as each input/integral function had its own MLP.</p></div>

These are perfectly balanced RGs, and therefore applying Algorithm 1 over them would deliver balanced PIC structures amenable to depth-wise C-sharing of integral units. We report full details about QTs and QGs in Appendix B. We denote a tensorized architecture as [RG]-[sum-product layer]-[K], e.g. QT-CP-16, which can be trained as a standard PC or materialized as QPC from a PIC. We treat pixels as categorical variables, and, as such, our architectures model probability mass functions.</p><p>Scaling PICs. For each model type, {PC, PIC}, we specify a pair (•, •) where the first (resp. second) argument specifies the sharing technique, {F, C, N}, for the input (resp. inner) layers/groups, where N stands for no sharing. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we report the time and GPU memory required to perform an Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> optimization step using PCs ( ), and PICs with ( ) and without ( ) functional C-sharing over the integral unit groups. We note that PICs using functional sharing ( ) proves very effective for scaling, requiring comparable resources as standard PCs ( ), while those who do not ( )like prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>-are orders of magnitude slower and quickly go Out-Of-Memory (OOM) for K &gt; 64. Remarkably, some QG-TK configurations of PICs ( ), see Table <ref type="table">D</ref>.2, require even less GPU memory than PCs, and this is because of the significant difference in the number of trainable parameters, since copies of these have to be stored by Adam during optimization. In fact, the number of parameters for PCs and PICs w/o functional sharing ( , ) is in the order of hundreds of millions </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">K = 16 K = 32 K = 64 K = 128 K = 256 K = 512</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: QPCs improve over PCs and other DGM baselines in terms of test-set bpd for the MNIST-family datasets.

Following prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, we extensively test QPCs and PCs as distribution estimators on standard image datasets. Our full results are in Appendix D.2, while we only report here the bits-per-dimension (bpd) of the best performing models, which always belong to a QG-CP architecture, reflecting the additional expressiveness of DAG-shaped RGs. Our full results also highlights how the the more expressive yet expensive Tucker layers we introduced for PICs deliver the best performance for small K, but are hard to scale. All QPCs are materialized from PICs applying F-sharing over input units and C-sharing over groups of integral units, i.e. PIC (F, C). We begin with the MNIST-family, which includes 6 datasets of gray-scale 28x28 images: MNIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, FASHIONMNIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and EMNIST with its 4 splits <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows that QPCs generally perform best, improving over standard PCs (5/6), complex heuristic-based PC learning schemes as pruning-and-growing (5/6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and some deep generative models (DGMs) (6/6).</p><p>Then, we move to larger RGB image datasets as CIFAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, ImageNet32, ImageNet64 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and CelebA <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. To compare against prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, we have to preprocess the datasets using the YCoCg transform, a lossy color-coding that consistently improves performance for PCs when applied to RGB images. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> We also report results over datasets preprocessed with the lossless YCoCg-R transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, effectively doubling the number of datasets. We report details about these transforms in Appendix C.3. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, we see that QPCs prove again very competitive, consistently outperforming standard PCs commonly trained with Adam, and the best performing PC from the literature, HCLT, which is trained via EM schemes and patch-wise methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Furthermore, QPCs are close to PCs trained via latent variable distillation (LVD, LVD-PG in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, a framework that requires extra supervision over their latent spaces by distilling information from existing deep generative models (DGMs). This technique requires pre-trained DGMs, several heuristics, and a final fine-tuning stage via EM or SGD, while PIC training method is instead end-to-end and self-contained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion &amp; Conclusion</head><p>With this work, we systematized the construction of PICs, extending them to DAG-like structures (Section 3.1), tensorizing (Section 3.2), and scaling their training with functional sharing (Section 3.3). In our experiments (Section 4), we showed how this pipeline is remarkably effective when the tractable approximations of PICs, QPCs, are used as distribution estimators. This in turn becomes a new and effective tool to learn PCs at scale. In fact, prior work has shown that naively training large PCs via EM or gradient-ascent is challenging, and that PC performance plateau as their size increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Our contributions go beyond these limitations, while offering a simple, principled and fully-differentiable pipeline that delivers performance that rival more sophisticated alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> (Section 4). We conjecture that this happens as training PCs via PICs drastically reduces the search space while allowing (i) smoother training dynamics and (ii) the materialization of arbitrarily large tractable models.</p><p>The development of tractable models is an important task in machine learning as they provide many inference routines, and can be used in many down-stream applications such as tabular data modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, generative modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, lossless compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, knowledge-graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, constrained text generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, and more. Our work has also certain parallels with tensor networks and (quasi-)tensor decompositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> recently showed how hierarchical tensor decompositions can be represented using the language of tensorized circuits. Furthermore, we note that the recent non-monotonic PCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> (i.e., PCs with negative sum parameters) can also be thought as the result of a quadrature process from PICs whose function can return negative values.</p><p>Our work does not come without limitations. Although we showed that training PICs with function sharing requires comparable resources as standard PCs, traditional continuous LV models as VAEs, flows and diffusion models are more scalable. Also, sampling from PICs is currently not possible, as we cannot perform differentiable sampling from our (multi-headed) MLPs. Future work may include the investigation of more efficient ways of training PICs, possibly using techniques as LVD or variational inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to directly maximize PIC lower-bounds, requiring numerical quadrature only as fine-tuning step to distill a performant tractable model. We believe our work will foster new research in the field of generative modeling, and specifically in the realm of tractable models.</p><p>A Background on Circuits Definition 3 (Circuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>). A circuit c over variables X is a parameterized computational graph encoding a function c(X), and comprising three kinds of computational units: input, product, and sum. Each product or sum unit u outputs a scalar and receives as inputs the output scalars of other units, denoted with the set in(u). Each unit u computes a function f u defined as: (i) f u (X u ) → R if u is an input unit, where f u is a function over variables X u ⊆ X, called its scope, (ii) Π i∈in(u) f i (X i ) if u is a product unit, and (iii) Σ i∈in(u) f i (X i ) if u is a sum unit, with w i ∈ R denoting the weighted sum parameters. The scope of a product or sum unit is the union of the scopes of its input units. Definition 4 (Probabilistic Circuit). A PC over variables X is a circuit c encoding a (possibly nonnormalized) distribution, e.g., a function that is non-negative for all values of X: c(x) ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ dom(X) Definition 5 (Smoothness). A circuit is smooth if, for each sum unit u, its inputs depend on the same variables: ∀u 1 , u 2 ∈ in(u), X u1 = X u2 . Definition 6 (Decomposability). A circuit is decomposable if the inputs of each product unit u depend on disjoint sets of variables: ∀u 1 , u 2 ∈ in(u), X u1 ̸ = X u2 . Definition 7 (Structured-decomposability <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>). A circuit is structured-decomposable if (i) it is smooth and decomposable, and (2) any pair of product units having the same scope decompose their scope at their input units in the same way.</p><p>Although all tensorized architectures mentioned in this paper are smooth and decomposable, only PCs built from tree RGs are also structured-decomposable, and as such are potentially less expressive because they belong to a restricted class.</p></div>

FFLs transform input z ∈ R I to</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">FFL(z) : R I → R M := [cos(2πf ⊺ 1 z), sin(2πf ⊺ 1 z), . . . , cos(2πf ⊺ M/2 z), sin(2πf ⊺ M/2 z)],</formula><p>where M is a hyper-parameter and vectors f i ∈ R I are non-learnable, randomly initialized parameters. FFLs have two main benefits: (i) They allow learning more expressive functions by avoiding over-smoothing behaviors, and (ii) they reduce the total number of trainable parameters when used instead of conventional linear layers as the initial layers in MLPs.</p></div>

Specifically, for each dataset, we perform a training cycle of T optimization steps, after which we perform a validation step and stop training if the validation log-likelihood did not improve by δ nats after 5 training cycles. Using δ &gt; 0 can avoid long trainings with negligible improvements. We report these common training hyper-parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">C</ref>.1.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).</p></div>

Answer: [NA] . Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines:</p><p>• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.</p><p>• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort. 12.

In contrast, we found that such sharing considerably improves performance for RGB image datasets. Besides improving performance for RGB image datasets, such sharing considerably lower the number of trainable parameters from D × K × P to only K × P where D is the number of pixels. For instance, parameterizing all input layers of a tensorized architecture with K = 256 built for 64x64 images would require 805, 306, 368 = 256 • 64 • 64 • 768 parameters, while only 3, 145, 728 if we apply the sharing. Therefore, without such sharing, we cannot even scale to big tensorized architectures (e.g. QG-CP-512) on our GPUs.All QPCs are materialized from PICs applying F-sharing over the group of input units, and C-sharing over the groups of integral units.We extensively compare QPCs and PCs as density estimators on several image datasets and report test-set bits-per-dimension (bpd) in TableD.3, Table D.4, and Table D.5. Table D.3: PCs with a shared input layer deliver comparable performance as PCs who do not on the MNIST-family datasets. We compare the bits-per-dimension of PCs with (w/) and without (w/o) a shared input layer considering three different tensorized architectures: QT-CP-512, QG-CP-512 and QG-TK-64.</figDesc><table><row><cell>QT-CP-512</cell><cell></cell><cell>QG-CP-512</cell><cell></cell><cell>QG-TK-64</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>w/o</cell><cell>w/</cell><cell>w/o</cell><cell>w/</cell><cell>w/o</cell><cell>w/</cell></row><row><cell cols="6">MNIST 1.175 ± 0.001 1.213 ± 0.002 1.177 ± 0.006 1.241 ± 0.005 1.257 ± 0.005 1.300 ± 0.004</cell></row><row><cell>F-MNIST</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>

All data used is publicly available. All model and experimental code to fully reproduce our own experimental results is shared. The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).</figDesc><table><row><cell>K 16 1.275 OOM QT-CP QG-CP QG-TK QPC PC QPC PC QPC 512 1.126 ± 0.004 1.175 ± 0.001 1.115 ± 0.005 1.177 ± 0.006 OOM 16 3.547 ± 0.003 3.589 ± 0.005 3.427 ± 0.006 3.464 ± 0.005 3.424 ± 0.009 3.446 ± 0.008 PC 32 3.429 ± 0.001 3.497 ± 0.003 3.319 ± 0.001 3.385 ± 0.004 3.323 ± 0.003 3.417 ± 0.005 64 3.349 ± 0.005 3.442 ± 0.003 3.258 ± 0.004 3.339 ± 0.004 3.251 ± 0.003 3.499 ± 0.006 128 3.289 QPC PC QPC PC QPC PC QT-CP-512 QG-CP-512 QG-TK-64 QT-CP-256 QG-CP-256 QG-TK-32 Justification: Guidelines: CelebA  Answer: [Yes] •</cell></row></table><note><p>MNIST *</p></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Author Contributions</head><p>GG led the project, proposed neural functional sharing, and ran all experiments. GG and AV devised the original idea of a pipeline to build PICs, and leverage tensorized folded circuits for training them. AV and EQ equally supervised all the phases of the project. CdC supervises the project, and critically read the manuscript and provided feedback.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>). We attach pytorch code for the RGB → YCoCg direction (left) and YCoCg → RGB direction (right), where one is the inverse of the other. The input to both functions is a tensor with discrete values in [0, 255], so their output. Guidelines:</p><p>• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Limitations</head><p>Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Limitations mentioned in the last section. Guidelines:</p><p>• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.</p><p>• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theory Assumptions and Proofs</head><p>Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: <ref type="bibr">[NA]</ref> Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.</p><p>Guidelines:</p><p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.</p><p>• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced. • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Result Reproducibility</head><p>Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?</p><p>Answer: <ref type="bibr">[Yes]</ref> Justification: All data used is publicly available. All model and experimental code to fully reproduce our own experimental results is shared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guidelines:</head><p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.</p><p>• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.</p><p>For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.</p><p>In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.</p></div>
