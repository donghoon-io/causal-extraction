<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper discusses methods to handle incomplete categorical data. Many medical studies deal solely with analyzing categorical data and, consequently, the statistical model that is used to analyze the data (from here on referred to as the substantive model) is also tailored to categorical data. For example, predictors of reduced length of hospital stay were studied using logistic regression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> determinants of caregivers' health were studied using loglinear modeling, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and the effectiveness of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II was investigated using a nonparametric item response analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> A frequently encountered problem is that the data are incomplete, which prevents a straightforward statistical analysis; a researcher should handle this problem appropriately. Klebanoff and Cole <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> found that the majority of applied researchers resort to ad-hoc methods such as complete-case analysis or pair-wise deletion, which may lead to biased statistical results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and reduced power. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> For handling incomplete continuous data, adequate alternatives have been proposed, extensively researched, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and implemented in major software packages such as SPSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and SAS. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Hence, there is no need for applied researchers to resort to ad-hoc methods in case of continuous data.</p><p>Incomplete data methods for categorical data have not yet been crystallized out, and it is unknown which method should be recommended to practitioners. Ideally, an incomplete-data method should meet three criteria. For the substantive model, it should produce parameter estimates (i) that are unbiased, (ii) that are stable in order to avoid unnecessary loss of power in the statistical analysis, and (iii) that have standard errors correctly reflecting the uncertainty due to missing data. Ideally, these criteria should be met for data sets with both small and large numbers of variables, sample sizes, and percentages of incomplete data, and for both simple and complex associations in the data.</p><p>With respect to these criteria, two incomplete-data methods for categorical data are especially promising: Multiple imputation using latent class analysis (MILC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> ) and multivariate imputation using chained equations (MICE <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> ). Both methods have the practical advantage that they can easily handle data sets containing a large number of variables and respondents. However, researchers having incomplete categorical data cannot yet readily apply MILC and MICE because there are various unresolved issues (explained hereunder). The impact of these issues on the three criteria for substantive models is unknown. In this study, we discuss two reasonable options for the unresolved issues for both MILC and MICE, and investigate to which degree they meet the three criteria, so as to decide which incomplete-data method should be selected for categorical data. Multiple imputation using a loglinear model (MILL <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ) and maximum likelihood for incomplete data (MLID, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> also known as full information maximum likelihood) are used as benchmarks. MILL is known to produce unbiased parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref> but can only handle a small number of variables; MLID is known to be asymptotically unbiased but may run into difficulties as the number of variables becomes very large. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, we briefly discuss the four incompletedata methods. For both MILC and MICE, we discuss two variants, resulting in six incomplete-data methods in total. Second, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of the methods in a theoretical discussion. Third, we present the results of two simulation studies. In Study 1, for dichotomous data, we compared MILC, MICE, MILL, and MLID with respect to the three criteria. In Study 2, for trichotomous data, we compared MILC, MICE, and complete-case analysis with respect to the three criteria. Fourth, we applied MLID, MILC, MICE, and complete-case analysis to a medical data set. Finally, we give recommendations based on the theoretical discussion and the two simulation studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Incomplete-data methods 2.1 Incomplete data</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">Let Y ¼ Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y J ð</formula><p>Þdenote the scores on the J variables, and let h be the generic notation for the vector of unknown parameters of the joint distribution of Y, denoted PðY; hÞ. To distinguish specific models Greek letters other than h may also be used to denote paramete r vectors. Note that Y j may be either a predictor variable or an outcome variable depending on the substantive model. If confusion arises, we add the superscripts p and o to indicate that a variable serves as a predictor variable or outcome variable, respectively. Y may contain missing values, and the objective is to deal with them appropriately.</p><p>Most incomplete-data methods, including the ones considered in this paper, assume that the mechanism that caused the missing values is ignorable, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> which means that two conditions should hold. First, the parameters that govern the missing data process must be unrelated to the parameters to be estimated, which is a rather unrestrictive assumption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Second, the data must be missing at random (MAR), which means that whether or not a score is missing only depends on scores observed in the study. If, after conditioning on all observed data, the missingness depends on missing values of variables included in the study or on variables not included in the study, MAR is violated and, as a result, the missingness mechanism is non-ignorable. Non-ignorable missingness may cause biased parameters in the substantive model (first criterion). Apart from special studies with planned missingness, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> MAR is unlikely to hold in practice, and it is impossible to test whether the MAR assumption holds for a particular data set. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Therefore, the degree to which MAR is violated (i.e. the degree to which the observed scores cannot explain the missingness mechanism) becomes important: If the violation of MAR becomes more severe, the parameter bias in the substantive model is likely to increase. If the number of variables in a data set increases, the degree to which the variables can explain the missingness mechanism is also likely to increase. Hence, if an incomplete-data method can handle a large number of variables, and if a large number of variables is available, the violation of MAR will most likely be less severe and the missingness mechanism is more likely to be ignorable. This notion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> plays an important role in our evaluation of incomplete-data methods and will be referred to as Schafer's notion on the number of variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Description of incomplete-data methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Maximum likelihood for incomplete data</head><p>MLID is a well-known and documented method to obtain parameter estimates and standard errors in the presence of missing data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> MLID constitutes estimating the parameters of the substantive model and their standard errors, using all observed data. For example, when studying predictors of reduced length of hospital stay using logistic regression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> MLID can be used to estimate the logistic regression model using all observed data. No further action is required; the obtained parameter estimates and standard errors can be directly interpreted. The substantive model can be an asymmetric model such as a logistic regression model or an item response theory model, which describe the conditional distribution of the outcome variables given the predictor variables PðY o jY p ; hÞ, or a symmetric model, such as a loglinear model, latent class model, or canonical correlation model, which describe the joint distribution of all variables PðY; hÞ. MLID assumes that the missingness mechanism is ignorable. For categorical data, specialized software is usually required to conduct MLID, such as LEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> or Mplus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Multiple imputation</head><p>Multiple imputation consists of creating m completed data sets by replacing the missing values in the data with plausible values m times. These plausible values replacing the missing values are called the imputed values. The statistical model that generates imputed values is referred to as the imputation model. After the multiple imputation, on each of the m completed data sets a substantive model is estimated, and the m sets of parameter estimates and standard errors are combined into a single set. Most researchers use m ¼ 5, but this value is currently debated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref> Using multiple imputation allows for separating the missing data handling and the substantive analysis; a researcher can estimate substantive models as if there had been no missing data, or distribute the completed data to other researchers for further analysis.</p><p>Multiple imputation starts in the same way as MLID for symmetric models: A statistical model is estimated describing the joint distribution PðY; hÞ. Rather than a substantive model, this model is an imputation model for obtaining imputed values from PðY; hÞ. For example, when studying predictors of reduced length of hospital stay using logistic regression, 1 a loglinear model describing the joint distribution of both predictor variables and reduced length of hospital stay may be used as an imputation model to generate imputed values replacing the missing data m times. After the multiple imputation, logistic regression analysis can be conducted on the completed data sets.</p><p>One must account for the fact that the imputed values are not observed and, therefore, uncertain. There are two sources of uncertainty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref> Firstly, the estimated parameters of the imputation model are uncertain; this uncertainty is expressed by their standard errors. Secondly, there is uncertainty due to sampling variability when drawing imputed values from PðY; hÞ. To account for parameter uncertainty, for each of the m data sets, a different set of parameters of the imputation model is used. In a Bayesian framework, the m sets of parameters of the imputation models are random draws from PðhjYÞ, the distribution of the parameters given the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> In a frequentist framework, the m sets of parameters are estimated using m nonparametric bootstrap samples of the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> A nonparametric bootstrap sample consists of randomly drawing a new sample of N observations with replacement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> To reflect uncertainty due to sampling variability, the replacement of missing values is done m times, yielding m completed data sets. The three multiple imputation methods for categorical data discussed in this paper differ in the way that they describe the joint distribution, PðY; hÞ, and how they account for parameter uncertainty. MILL is discussed briefly because this method is ready for use; MILC and MICE are described in more detail so as to allow the discussion of the specific options these methods offer.</p><p>Multiple imputation using a loglinear model. MILL uses a loglinear model as the imputation model. Let the parameters of the loglinear model be denoted j; the saturated loglinear model for dichotomous responses can be written as logPðY;</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">jÞ ¼ þ X J i¼1 i Y i þ X JÀ1 i¼1 X J j¼iþ1 ij Y i Y j þ Á Á Á þ 1,2, ...; J Y 1 Y 2 Á Á Á Y J :<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>The joint distribution is obtained by taking the exponential of the right-hand side of equation (1). Typically, a saturated loglinear model is used to obtain imputation values because it captures all possible associations in the data; therefore, it is the gold standard for multiple imputation of categorical data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> If higher-order interaction terms are omitted, the approximation of the joint distribution by the loglinear model may deteriorate. MILL can, for example, be conducted using software packages CAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> or Latent GOLD 4.5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25</ref> which utilize a Bayesian and a nonparametric bootstrap approach, respectively, to account for parameter uncertainty.</p><p>Multiple imputation using a latent class model. MILC uses a latent class model to estimate the joint distribution of the variables in the data. Let X denote a discrete latent variable with K latent classes, indexed by k ðk ¼ 1, . . . , KÞ. Let n denote the vector of parameters of the latent class model; n can be divided into n x , the latent class proportions, and n y the conditional response probabilities. Under a latent class model, joint distribution PðY; nÞ has the following form <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">PðY; nÞ ¼ X K k¼1 P X ¼ k; n x ð ÞP YjX ¼ k; n y À Á ¼ X K k¼1 P X ¼ k; n x ð Þ Y J j¼1 P Y j jX ¼ k; n y j À Á :</formula><p>If the number of latent classes is sufficiently large, a latent class model correctly picks up the first, second, and higher order moments of the response variables, as is the case with all forms of mixture models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30</ref> It is unknown how many latent classes are sufficient for a good approximation of the joint distribution. Vermunt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> argued that it is better to have too many than too few latent classes. Therefore, out of three selection criteria, Akaike's information criterion (AIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31</ref> ), Bayesian information criterion (BIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> ), and AIC3, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33</ref> they suggested using AIC to select the number of latent classes because it yields the largest number of latent classes. Hence, letting AIC determine the number of latent classes, abbreviated MILC (AIC), is the first option for MILC. However, it is expected that an even larger number of latent classes can further improve the approximation of the joint distribution. Having a relatively large number of latent classes, abbreviated MILC (Large), is the second option for MILC. MILC can be applied using Latent GOLD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25</ref> which uses the nonparametric bootstrap to account for parameter uncertainty.</p><p>Multivariate imputation using chained equations. MICE 12 is a fully conditional specification method, which specifies the imputation model on a variable-by-variable basis using a separate conditional distribution for each incomplete variable. Let Y Àj denote the scores on all variables except Y j . MICE reduces the problem of finding one J-dimensional joint distribution PðY; hÞ to finding J univariate conditional distributions PðY 1 jY À1 ; hÞ, . . . , PðY J jY ÀJ ; hÞ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> Conditional distribution PðY j jY Àj ; hÞ is used for imputation of Y j (j ¼ 1, . . . , J). Under certain conditions, a draw from each of the J conditional distributions is equivalent to a single draw from the joint distribution, 14 but it is not guaranteed. Results from simulation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34</ref> suggest that the problem is unlikely to be serious in practice.</p><p>MICE starts with replacing missing values of the variables by draws from their respective marginal distributions. Next, in an iterative process, the imputed values are updated variable by variable using the univariate conditional distributions. When Y j is imputed, the other variables act as predictor. If the joint distribution that is defined by the J conditional distributions exists then this iterative process is a Gibbs sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref> and converges to the joint distribution of the J variables. Often, as little as 10 to 20 iterations are required.</p><p>The imputation model describing the conditional probabilities PðY 1 jY À1 ; hÞ, . . . , PðY J jY ÀJ ; hÞ can be any appropriate regression model depending on the nature of the outcome variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35</ref> : linear regression in combination with predictive mean matching, logistic regression, polytomous regression, and nonlinear regression. We focused on two imputation models; the first one being logistic regression (abbreviated MICE (LOG)) which is the default method in the R-package MICE <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> for dichotomous outcome variables (for Study 2, polytomous regression is used, which is the extension of MICE (LOG) to variables with more than 2 categories; for details see, e.g. Van Buuren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> ). Let b denote the vector of parameters for the logistic regression model. MICE (LOG) models conditional distribution PðY j jY Àj ; bÞ as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">logit P Y j jY Àj ; b À Á Â Ã ¼ 0 þ 1 Y 1 þ Á Á Á þ jÀ1 Y jÀ1 þ jþ1 Y jþ1 þ Á Á Á þ J Y J</formula><p>We also considered linear regression in combination with predictive mean matching (abbreviated MICE (PMM)). The first step of MICE (PMM) is to obtain a predicted value by means of linear regression in which all other variables serve as predictors. In the second step, the respondent that has the most similar predicted value as well as an observed value on the variable that is being imputed is selected as the nearest neighbor. Subsequently, the observed value of this nearest neighbor is used as the imputation value for the respondent with a missing value.</p><p>Parameter uncertainty is accounted for in a Bayesian framework; a new set of parameters is drawn from its posterior distribution for the construction of each imputed data set. More specifically, the MICE algorithm involves iteratively sampling parameter values b from their posterior distribution and imputing the missing values Y j by drawing from the conditional distribution PðY j jY Àj ; bÞ. This corresponds with a Gibbs sampling scheme if the joint distribution of the variables can be constructed from their univariate conditional distributions and if the distribution from which parameters are drawn can be constructed from the joint distribution of the variables and an appropriate prior distribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> These two conditions are not fulfilled when using MICE with categorical data, which means that the algorithm is not an exact Gibbs sampler. MICE can be conducted using the R package MICE <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> or the STATA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36</ref> package ICE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Other incomplete-data methods</head><p>We have three remarks on other incomplete-data methods. First, besides MLID and multiple imputation, there are two other categories of incomplete-data methods: the fully Bayesian method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38</ref> and weighted estimating equations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> We did not consider these two approaches to limit the scope of this paper. A full Bayesian analysis with for example WinBugs is in fact similar to both MLID and multiple imputation; that is, the parameters of the substantive model are estimated using the incomplete data using an algorithm containing a step in which the missing values are imputed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38</ref> Results can be expected to be similar to MLID. Weighting is typically used to deal with completely missing data and has limited practical use with partially missing data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39</ref> It may moreover yield instable estimates in the presence of influential weights. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40</ref> Second, a popular imputation model for multiple imputation is the multivariate normal distribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The method is robust against deviations from normality 41 and may even perform well for categorical data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42</ref> although some studies reported serious bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44</ref> We did not consider incomplete data-methods that were not designed for categorical data as these methods are not suitable for nominal variables (e.g., blood type, eye color, surgical outcome).</p><p>Third, the best known ad-hoc method is probably complete-case analysis, in which only the observations without any missing values are used to estimate the substantive model. In other words, subjects who have at least one missing value are discarded from the analysis. Hence, in contrast to MLID, complete-case analysis does not incorporate all available information. Complete-case analysis reduces power and may yield biased parameter estimates for the substantive model if the data are not missing completely at random (MCAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> ; this MCAR assumption is considered to be unrealistic in most situations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Complete-case analysis is included in Study 2 and the real-data example. For Study 2, the number of variables was too large for more preferable benchmarks such as MILL and MLID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Advantages, disadvantages, and unresolved issues of the incomplete-data methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Practical issues</head><p>For application of the incomplete-data methods, sample size, complexity of the association structure in the data, and percentage of missingness are not restrictive for any of the methods. A limitation of MILL is that it cannot handle large numbers of variables because the number of cells in the contingency table that has to be evaluated in the loglinear model becomes too large. For example, the number of cells that need be evaluated exceeds one million for 20 dichotomous variables and one billion for 30 dichotomous variables, 19 trichotomous variables, or 13 variables with five categories. In cases where the substantive model contains fewer variables than available in the data set, a possible solution is to consider only those variables that are used in the substantive model. However, following Schafer's notion on the number of variables, using only a small number of variables for the imputation model may result in biased parameter estimates. For MILC and MICE, large numbers of variables do not pose a problem. A potential problem for MLID is that it usually requires specialized software, depending on the substantive model that one wants to estimate, whereas standard data-analysis techniques can be applied after the imputation phase of MILL, MILC and MICE. Moreover, MLID can only be used if the number of variables in substantive model is not too large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Bias</head><p>We consider three possible causes of bias in the parameter estimates: First, non-ignorable missingness in the data. Following Schafer's notion on the number of variables, it is suggested that the inclusion of many variables in the imputation model makes it more likely that violations of ignorability are minor. The second possible cause of bias is misspecification of the imputation model so that it is too parsimonious. The imputation model should be as general as possible; this ensures that the imputed values behave as neutral as possible in subsequent analyses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Hence, the main criterion of an adequate imputation model is whether it captures all the associations between categorical variables that exist on the population level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The third possible cause of bias is misspecification of the substantive model. However, this is unrelated to the incomplete-data method being used and is not pursued further.</p><p>For MLID, no imputation model needs to be specified but a violation of the ignorability assumption may result in biased parameter estimates. Statistical analyses that are based on MLID only include those variables in the data that are substantively relevant, possibly excluding many variables. When the number of variables in the substantive model is small, then, following Schafer's notion on the number of variables, the missingness mechanism in the reduced data is less likely to be ignorable. Simulation studies showed that under ignorable missingness, MLID yields unbiased parameter estimates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> For MILL, the imputation model being too parsimonious is not an issue because the imputation model is typically the saturated model. However, MILL can handle only a limited number of categorical variables. As a result, following Schafer's notation on the number of variables, the missingness mechanism in the reduced data may not be treated as ignorable possibly resulting in biased parameter estimates. Simulation studies showed that under ignorable missingness, MILL yields unbiased parameter estimates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> For MILC and MICE, the amount of non-ignorable missingness may be reduced if the data contain many variables relevant for predicting the missing values (Schafer's notion on the number of variables) because both methods can handle a very large number of (auxiliary) variables. For MICE, it is unknown which of the two variants yields the least bias, for MILC, it is expected that a large number of latent classes, MILC (Large), produces less bias than a smaller number of latent classes, MILC (AIC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Stability</head><p>We consider three possible causes that influence the stability of parameter estimates in the presence of incomplete data. A first possible cause is a too small effective sample. It is well known sample size has a positive effect on stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45</ref> None of the incomplete-data methods under investigation unduly reduce the effective sample size, in the way some ad hoc methods do (e.g., complete-case analysis, pair-wise deletion). However, it is unknown whether the incomplete-data methods under investigation yield the same stability of parameter estimates given a fixed sample size. A second possible cause is misspecification of the imputation model so that it is too complex. This is the wellknown tradeoff between bias and stability: If the imputation model is too parsimonious it may result in biased outcomes, if it is too complex, it may result in less stable outcomes. For most researchers, unbiased parameter estimates are more important than stable parameter estimates. The third possible cause of instability is misspecification of the substantive model so that it is too complex. However, this is unrelated to the incomplete-data method being used and is not pursued further.</p><p>Only for the second possible cause of instability, an overly complex imputation model, we have expectations for the incomplete-data methods under investigation. MLID does not require an imputation model, so no loss of stability can ensue from an overly complex imputation model. For MILL, the imputation model is saturated meaning that it is expected to be overly complex in most cases. Therefore, a certain loss of stability is expected for MILL in comparison to MLID.</p><p>For MILC, the two variants are expected to differ in stability because their respective imputation models differ in complexity. MILC (Large) uses a relatively large number of latent classes which means that its imputation model is expected to be able to capture every possible association. As is the case with MILL, results produced by MILC (Large) are expected to lose a certain degree of stability because its imputation model is expected to be overly complex. MILC (AIC) estimates the required number of latent classes using AIC, which results in a relatively small number of latent classes. Therefore, its imputation model is more parsimonious and its results are expected to be more stable than MILC (Large).</p><p>For MICE, the two variants differ in the conditional imputation model that is used. The stability of MICE depends on the degree to which higher order associations are included in the conditional imputation model. The default setting of MICE (PMM) only includes main effects. However, because predictive mean matching is used, all associations can be picked up for data sets with a small number of variables. Therefore, we expect that the stability of the parameter estimates produced by MICE (PMM) is similar to MILL and MILC (Large). The default setting of MICE (LOG) also only includes main effects. Therefore, MICE (LOG) is expected to have relatively stable results.</p></div>

Fourth, we used the completed data sets to estimate the parameters of the regression part of the population model and we reported the bias and stability of the parameter estimates. The population model was defined for five dichotomous predictor variables Y 1 , . . . , Y 5 , and one dichotomous outcome variable Y 6 . The categories were coded 0 and 1 (dummy coding).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Predictor variables</head><p>Incomplete-data method was a within factor with six levels: MILC (AIC), MILC (Large), MICE (PMM), MICE (LOG), MLID, and MILL. The incomplete-data methods determine the imputation model and may thus affect both bias and stability.</p><p>Strength of the interaction term was a between factor with three levels that was manipulated by varying parameter 23 in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">3</ref>). The levels were no three-way association ( 23 ¼ :00), medium ( 23 ¼ À:80), and strong ( 23 ¼ À2:00). Strength of the three-way association sets requirements for the complexity of the imputation model. If this effect increases, a more complex imputation model is required to pick up the associations in the data. It is expected that strength of the three-variable association affects both bias and stability.</p><p>Percentage of missingness was a between factor with three levels: moderate (10% missingness), high (20% missingness), and extreme (40% missingness). The percentage of missingness was manipulated by varying parameters 1 and 2 in equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>), respectively. For 10% missingness, 1 ¼ À2:46 and 2 ¼ À2:53, for 20% missingness, 1 ¼ À1:41 and 2 ¼ À1:44, and for 40% missingness, 1 ¼ À:39 and 2 ¼ À:41. As the percentage of missingness increases, the imputation model becomes more important. The condition with 40% of missingness is included because the consequences of an inadequate imputation model are magnified by an increase in the percentage of missingness.</p><p>Sample size was a between factor with two levels: Small (N ¼ 200) and large (N ¼ 1000).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Bias</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the most important results for bias for 40% missingness. For lower percentages of missingness, the pattern of the bias was similar but the absolute values were smaller. This confirms that for larger percentages of missingness, the imputation model becomes more important. The most important result is that incomplete-data methods MLID, MILC (AIC), and MICE (LOG) produced large bias in the estimates of 2 and 23 when there was an interaction effect in the data ( 23 6 ¼ 0), whereas estimates of 4 , a parameter not influenced by an interaction effect, showed much less bias. These results suggest that MILC (AIC) and MICE (LOG) have imputation models that are too parsimonious to pick up the three-way association in the data. Furthermore, the results suggest that MLID cannot handle very well the combination of a small sample size and a complex association. Seemingly, the asymptotic property of unbiased parameter estimates is not fully established under these circumstances. A second result is that MILL, which we used as a gold standard, produced similar bias or sometimes more bias (e.g., for 2 in condition 23 ¼ À2, N ¼ 200) than MILC (Large) and MICE (PMM). A third result is that the bias was slightly larger for N ¼ 200 than for N ¼ 1000, which indicates that increased sampling variability may somewhat increase bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Stability</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the most important results for stability for 40% missingness. The most important result is that stability does not change dramatically across incomplete-data methods. MILC (AIC) was slightly more stable than MILC (Large), and MICE (LOG) is slightly more stable than MICE (PMM). This was expected because MILC (AIC) and MICE (LOG) are more parsimonious than MILC (Large) and MICE (PMM), respectively. The expected result that MILL would be less stable than MLID was not demonstrated. As expected, sample size had a positive effect on stability. For small samples (N ¼ 200), the stability could be considered low, resulting in low power. For example, the population value of 4 was equal to 1, but in case sdð 4 Þ ¼ :501 (MILL, medium three-variable association), which is even one of the smaller standard deviations we found, one may expect to find estimates of 4 between .02 and 1.98 (95% confidence interval). For large samples (N ¼ 1000), the stability is much better. Percentage of missingness also had a negative effect on the stability. This can be expected because a larger percentage of missingness in fact means a reduction of the sample size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Bias of the standard errors</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the most important results for bias of the standard errors for 20% missingness. Bias of the standard errors was smaller for N ¼ 1000 than for N ¼ 200. Bias of the standard errors was largest for the parameters associated with the three-variable association ( 2 and 23 ) For N ¼ 200, MILL and MILC (Large) had the smallest bias, whereas MILC (AIC) and MICE (LOG) overestimated the standard errors and MLID and MICE (PMM) underestimated the standard errors. For N ¼ 1000, MILL, MILC (AIC), MILC (Large), and MICE (PMM) had the smallest bias, whereas MLID underestimated and MICE (LOG) overestimated the standard errors. This renders MILC (Large) as the most favorable incomplete-data method with respect to bias in standard errors. 4 Study 2: bias, stability, and bias in standard errors produced by MILC, MICE and complete-case analysis for a larger number of trichotomous variables</p><p>In Study 2, we compared incomplete-data methods MILC (AIC), MILC (Large, K ¼ 33), MICE (PMM), and MICE (LOG) to complete-case analysis, on bias of the parameter estimates, stability of the parameter estimates, and bias of the standard errors. Benchmarks MLID and MILL could no longer be used because the number of variables (11) was too large. The main question for Study 2 was whether MILC and MICE would also work for polytomous categorical data and for large numbers of possible response patterns. In Study 1, the number of possible response patterns was 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ¼ 64, whereas in Study 2, the number of possible response patterns was increased to 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> ¼ 177,147.</p><p>The main objective for the design of Study 2 is that the associations among the variables need to be complex, to test whether the incomplete-data methods can pick up the associations correctly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Real-data example</head><p>We applied the most promising variants of MILC and MICE (i.e., MILC (Large, K ¼ 12) and MICE (PMM)), complete-case analysis, and MLID to data from the Investigators of Projective Services Project for Older Persons, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47</ref> which have been discussed and analyzed earlier by Fuchs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48</ref> to illustrate the MLID approach. The data set contains the scores of 164 patients on six dichotomous variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>). One patient had a missing value on the physical status, 33 had a missing value for mental status, and 29 respondents had a missing value on both physical and mental status. The question of interest is whether the unexpected negative association between treatment and survival disappears when controlling for age, gender, physical status, and mental status.</p><p>The substantive model predicts survival by the main effects of all variables, plus the interaction effect of mental status, Y 1 , and physical status, Y 2. We defined the following regression model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">logitðY 6 Þ ¼ 0 þ 1 Y 1 þ 2 Y 2 þ 3 Y 3 þ 4 Y 4 þ 5 Y 5 þ 12 Y 1 Y 2 :<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>Contrary to Fuchs, we chose to include the interaction between mental status and physical status because we were interested in whether the imputation methods yielded similar results to MLID in a model containing a higher-order association. Once the data had been imputed using MILC (Large)  and MICE (PMM), the substantive model defined in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">7</ref>) was estimated. We also estimated the logistic regression model using MLID (as a benchmark) and complete-case analysis. Schafer's notion on the number of variables is of no concern in this analysis because the substantive model and the imputation model are identical; both models include all available variables. Therefore, the performance of MILC (Large), MICE (PMM), and complete-case analysis was assessed by comparing them to MLID (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref>). For all incomplete-data methods, only age ( 3 , negative effect) had a significant effect on survival status. The fact that all other effects were not statistically significant may be due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, it remains interesting to compare the parameter estimates across incomplete-data methods. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref> shows that the estimates yielded by MILC (Large) were very similar to MLID, for all parameters. MICE (PMM) produced estimates of 3 , 4 and 5 that were very similar to MLID, but yielded relatively large differences for parameters 1 , 2 , and 12 . Complete-case analysis produced rather large differences for the estimates of 2 , 4 , 5 and 12 . MLID, MILC (Large), and MICE (PMM) did not have large differences in the estimated standard errors. However, complete-case analysis yielded relatively large standard errors for parameters 3 , 4 , and 5 , compared to MLID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>The aim of this paper was to investigate which incomplete-data method for categorical data should be recommended to practitioners. We assessed the performance of MILC and MICE with regard to three criteria, relative to MLID, MILL, and complete-case analysis. Based on the theoretical discussion, Study 1, and Study 2, MILC (Large) appears to be the incomplete-data method that meets the three criteria to the greatest extent. The other incomplete-data methods have one or more features that make them suboptimal. MILL cannot handle more than a few variables, MLID does not allow for the use of small substantive model as it can affect the MAR assumption, and may yield biased parameter estimates for a complex association in case of a small sample size. While in Study 1 MICE (PMM) performed rather well, Study 2 showed that MICE (PMM) may yield biased parameter estimates when the number of possible data pattern is large, especially when the sample size is small. MILC (AIC) and MICE (LOG) may fail to capture higher-order associations in the data, which yields parameter estimates with an unacceptably high bias. In Study 2 it was demonstrated that complete-case analysis yields very large bias in the parameter estimates and a loss of power due to inflated standard errors. The findings in the real-data example were consistent with these results. A remaining issue with MILC is that there is not yet a guideline indicating the minimum number of required latent classes. The simulation study showed that over fit does not seem to be a problem, which was also argued by Vermunt et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> so one can always resort to estimating a latent class model with many classes. However, having a minimum of required latent classes would greatly facilitate the use of MILC because estimating latent class models with 40, 50, or 60 latent classes can be very time consuming. We showed that in case of a small table AIC is not a good criterion because the number of classes is too low; for a large table MILC (AIC) yielded good results. A heuristic rule may be to use as many classes as there are categories in the data. For example, for a data set consisting of 10 variables with three response categories and 5 dichotomous variables, the number of latent classes would be 10 Â 3 þ 5 Â 2 ¼ 40 latent classes. Whether this heuristic rule is reasonable should be investigated in future research.</p><p>An additional comment should be made for MICE (LOG), as it may have been presented too negatively. The problem of MICE (LOG) is that in the default setting, interaction effects are not included in the conditional models. As a result, the imputation model may be too parsimonious yielding biased parameter estimates. Further research would be required to investigate whether this method is able to produce unbiased results if the conditional model included higher-order interactions.</p><p>Lastly, we note that each incomplete-data method had to be applied using a different software package, as there is no package available that applies all of the methods. Further research is warranted to investigate the potential differences between implementations of MILC and MICE across software packages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Stability</head><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows the stability of 2 , 3 , and 12 . The most important result is that (almost) unbiased parameter estimates (see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) showed similar stability across methods, whereas biased parameter estimates tended to be either more stable or more unstable. This effect was clearer for N ¼ 500 than for N ¼ 1000. For example, for the estimate of 2 , MILC (Large), MILC (AIC), MICE (PMM), and MICE (LOG) show similar bias and similar stability of parameter estimates. However, completecase analysis overestimated 2 and this estimate was too stable, whereas MICE (PMM) and MICE (LOG) overestimated 3 and this estimate was too unstable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Bias of the standard errors</head><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows the bias of the standard errors of 2 , 3 , and 12 . Bias of the standard errors was smaller for N ¼ 1000 than for N ¼ 500. The multiple imputation methods yielded similar upward bias in their standard errors, whereas complete-cases analysis tended to yield a larger overestimation of the standard errors. Bias was largest for the standard error of the interaction effect ( 12 ).  </p></div>
