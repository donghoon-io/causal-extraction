<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Network reconstruction methods have become ubiquitous to analyze large-scale informationrich data from the latest genomic technologies. Recently, methodological advances in the field have been seeking to learn causal relationships using time series or controlled perturbation experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. However, such strategies can be technically impracticable or costly, if not unethical, in many biological contexts.</p><p>Alternatively, graphical models can be learned by simply observing enough random variations in unperturbed data, as for the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from singlecell gene expression data. However, most methods based on this principle, such as Bayesian search-and-score [3], sparse inverse covariance estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, maximum entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or diffusion map <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> methods, assume as underlying models either causal networks with only directed edges or non-causal networks with only undirected edges. Thus, they cannot uncover nor rule out causality in observational data. By contrast, constraint-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which identify structural constraints corresponding to all dispensable edges in a graph, can in principle uncover causality from purely observational data. Advanced constraint-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> reconstruct Markov equivalent models of a broad class of "ancestral graphs" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, that include undirected (-), directed (!) and possibly bidirected ($) edges originating from latent common causes, L, unobserved in the available data (i.e. ⇠ L ⇢). However, constraint-based methods are often not robust on small datasets and have algorithmic complexity issues when including unobserved latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Yet, latent variables are commonly found in many real applications, as in the case of an unobserved transcription factor TF co-regulating two co-expressed genes, i.e. G 1 ⇠ TF ⇢ G 2 (see example of single cell transcriptomics in the Results section). These unobserved variables should not be ignored in practice, as they actually impact the causal relationships between observed variables, leading to spurious causal association between co-regulated genes G 1 and G 2 in the previous example. While the algorithmic difficulties of constraint-based methods have so far limited their applicability in practice, understanding cause-effect relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> remains of primary interest to model complex biological systems and anticipate their response to environmental changes or genetic alterations.</p><p>We report here an information-theoretic method, that simultaneously circumvents the complexity and robustness issues of constraint-based approaches, and demonstrate its applicability to real biological data. The method builds on an earlier information-theoretic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, in order to i) include latent variables, a notorious conceptual and algorithmic difficulty in causal network reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and ii) provide an edge specific confidence assessment of retained edges, which lacks in traditional constraint-based methods. Both aspects are important in practice to reconstruct robust networks from actual biological data. The approach is applied to reconstruct causal networks from a variety of genomic datasets at different biological size and time scales, from single cells to organisms and entire phyla.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background: Signature of causality and unobserved latent variables in observational data</head><p>Our information-theoretic method for network reconstruction is based on the analysis of multivariate information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, I(X; Y; Z; Á Á Á), which extends the concept of mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> beyond two variables, I(X;Y) = ∑ x,y p(x,y)log(p(x,y)/p(x)p(y)), where p(x), p(y) and p(x,y) are the measured probability distributions of single or joint variables X and Y from the available data D (see Materials and methods). Most importantly, unlike two-point mutual information, I(X;Y), which cannot distinguish causal from non-causal relations between variables X and Y, multivariate information involving more than two points, I(X;Y;Z;Á Á Á), may imply cause-effect relationships between the underlying variables, S1 File.</p><p>In fact, the signature of causality in purely observational data is associated to a unique correlation pattern involving at least three variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>: it concerns two mutually (or conditionally) independent variables, I(X;Y) = 0, which are therefore not connected to each other, yet both connected to a third variable Z, Fig 1A . This situation entails the orientations of a 'vstructure' or 'unshielded' collider, X ! Z Y, because the edges XZ and YZ cannot be undirected, nor Z be a cause of X or Y, as these alternative graphical models imply correlations that would contradict independence between X and Y. V-structures are the hallmark of causality in observational data: networks with v-structures are necessary causal, while causal models without v-structures can be shown to be equivalent to their undirected counterparts from the viewpoint of observational data.</p><p>Beyond v-structures, colliders may also be found in series along a collider path, as in</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X ! Z $ Y W, Fig 1B &amp; 1C</formula><p>, where the bidirected edge, Z $ Y, indicates that Z is not a cause of Y nor Y a cause of Z. It implies that the correlation between Z and Y is due to at least one latent common cause, L, unobserved in the available dataset, Z ⇠ L ⇢ Y, as outlined above. Hence, statistical dependencies and independencies in purely observational data can, in principle, provide structural constraints for network reconstruction as well as information on causal relationships across observed and possibly unobserved latent variables. These results underline the wealth of information which cannot be captured from two-point correlations only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An information-theoretic method to learn causal networks with latent variables</head><p>The signature of causality and unobserved latent variables in multi-point correlation statistics enables to rephrase constraint-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> within an information-theoretic framework. Constraint-based approaches, sketched in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>, start from a fully connected network and proceed by iteratively removing dispensable edges between variables X and Y for which a conditional independence can be found, i.e. I(X; Y|{A i }) = 0 (Fig 1D <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">step 1</ref>). This rationale of constraint-based methods can be interpreted from an information perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, using the generic decomposition of mutual information, I(X; Y), relative to the set of variables {A i },</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">IðX; YÞ ¼ IðX; Y; fA i gÞ þ IðX; YjfA i gÞ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where I(X; Y; {A i }) can be seen as the global indirect contribution of {A i } to I(X; Y) and I(X; Y| {A i }) as the remaining (direct) contribution (see Eq 8 in Materials and methods). Conditional independence, I(X; Y|{A i }) = 0, then implies that {A i } is a 'separation set' which intercepts all indirect paths contributing to the total mutual information, i.e. I(X; Y) = I(X; Y; {A i }). In practice, however, conditional mutual information cannot be exactly zero for finite datasets but the probability that the XY edge should be removed can be estimated from the available data as, P XY * exp(-NI(X; Y|{A i })), up to some normalization constant, where N is the number of independent samples (S1 File). The undirected network 'skeleton', resulting from the removal of all dispensable edges, is then partially directed by orienting all v-structures (Fig 1D <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">step 2</ref>), based on the signature of causality, outlined above, and propagating these orientations on The main computational complexity of constraint-based methods is to uncover a valid combination of contributing nodes {A i } for each dispensable edge XY. In absence of latent variables, the combinatorial search can be restricted to the sole neighbors of X or Y, which are sufficient to intercept all information contributions from indirect paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. However, this efficient algorithm cannot be used in the presence of latent variables, as collider paths may require to extend the combinatorial search for conditioning set {A i } to non-adjacent variables of X and Y <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, as illustrated in Fig 1C . In practice, this intrinsic difficulty stemming from latent variables has been addressed through more complex algorithmic approaches, such as the FCI algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and its more recent approximate variant, RFCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Beyond algorithmic complexity issues, traditional constraint-based methods are also known to be highly sensitive to sampling noise inherent to finite datasets and are not robust on typical datasets of interest (e.g. expression data of 30 to 40 genes measured in a few hundreds to thousands of single cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, see application and Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 below</ref>).</p><p>The present algorithmic approach, miic (multivariate information-based inductive causation), circumvents the complexity and robustness issues of standard constraint-based methods by avoiding to directly tackle the combinatorial search of complete separation sets. Instead, it progressively collects, one-by-one, their most likely contributors, {A i } n = {A 1 , A 2 , Á Á Á, A n }, based on a quantitative score for each pair of variables XY (S1 File). The global indirect contribution is then obtained iteratively as, where I(X; Y; A n |{A i } n-1 ) &gt; 0, corresponds to the contribution of the most likely nth variable A n after collecting the first n-1 most likely contributors, {A i } n-1 (see Eq 10 in Materials and methods). We demonstrate in the current study that this iterative framework, which proved to be robust to sampling noise in absence of latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, can in fact be extended to include latent variables by collecting the contributors {A i } within the whole set of observed variables, instead of amongst the sole neighbors of X and Y in absence of latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This simple approach to include latent variables circumvents the algorithmic complexity of standard constraint-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, while improving ten to hundred folds their performance in both prediction accuracy and running time, as discussed in the next section.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">IðX; Y; fA i g n Þ ¼ IðX; Y; fA i g nÀ 1 Þ þ IðX; Y; A n jfA i g nÀ 1 Þ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithmic performance on causal and non-causal benchmark datasets</head><p>We have assessed the performance of miic on a broad range of causal and non-causal benchmark networks from real-life as well as simulated datasets from P ' 30 up to 500 variables and N = 10 up to 50,000 independent samples (Materials and methods). The causal benchmark networks, which include an increasing fraction (0% to 20%) of hidden latent variables, are derived using partially observed Bayesian networks, that is, considering some variables as hidden. These unobserved variables are usually present in many real applications and cannot be ignored in practice, as they actually impact the causal relationships between observed variables, as illustrated in Fig 1B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">-1D</ref>. The non-causal benchmark datasets have been obtained from Monte Carlo sampling of Ising-like interacting networks sharing approximately the same twopoint direct correlations with real-life benchmark causal networks but lacking causality. Monte Carlo sampling leads, however, to significant correlations between successive samples, which needs to be taken into account through an effective number of independent samples (Materials and methods). Reconstructed causal networks have been compared to partial ancestral graphs (PAGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which are the representatives of the Markov equivalent class of all ancestral graphs consistent with the conditional independences in the available data. In practice, benchmark PAGs have been derived by hiding some variables in benchmark directed acyclic graphs (DAG) using the dag2pag function of the pcalg package with slight modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The alternative inference methods used for comparison with miic are the FCI algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and its recent approximate variant RFCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> implemented in the pcalg package <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The results obtained with FCI and RFCI are in fact very similar and we only present here comparisons with the more recent RFCI algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. RFCI's results are shown for an adjustable significance level α = 0.01 and using the stable implementation of the skeleton learning algorithm, as well as the majority rule for the orientation and propagation steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which give overall the best results. The results have been evaluated in terms of running time, as well as, Precision (or positive predictive value), Recall or Sensitivity (true positive rate), and F-score, which is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (Materials and methods). Precision, Recall and Fscore have been derived for the undirected skeleton of the networks (dashed lines in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Furthermore, no causality is predicted by miic for non causal datasets, even from small effective numbers of independent samples (Materials and methods and S6 and S7 Figs). This underlines miic accuracy to uncover true causality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Edge confidence assessments</head><p>This information-theoretic method and its algorithmic implementation (S1 Software) are very general and can be applied to a wide range of datasets, provided a sufficient number of independent samples is available. We report here the results obtained with genomic datasets spanning a broad range of biological size and time scales from single cells and tissues to organisms and entire phyla. In addition to including latent causal variables, we have also assessed the confidence of predicted edges with an edge specific confidence ratio C XY ¼ P XY =hP rand XY i, where P XY is the probability to remove the XY edge, introduced above, and hP rand XY i the average of the same probability after randomizing the datasets for each variable (see Materials and methods, and S1 File section 2.2 for details). Hence, the lower C XY , the higher the confidence on the XY edge, which can be used to retain only high confidence edges in the predicted networks.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect of confidence filtering on the reconstruction of benchmark networks (S8 &amp; S9 Figs) demonstrates that the filtering of individual edges improves the Precision of the reconstruction (at the expense of its Sensitivity or Recall) not only for the network skeleton, as expected, but also for the network orientations, while retaining overall similar F-scores. This demonstrates the interest and consistency of using such confidence filtering to obtain an enhanced and tunable precision of the reconstructed networks for real biological applications. Indeed, an enhanced precision might be desirable in many practical applications for which the correctness of predicted edges is more important than the occasional dismissal of less certain edges.

In addition, the sign of each retained edge, X -Y, is defined by the sign of the partial correlation coefficient, ρ XYÁA , between X and Y conditioned on its derived contributors A = {A i } in Step 1, with positive edges corresponding to positive partial correlations and negative edges corresponding to negative partial correlations, i.e. partial anti-correlations (S1 File). Algorithmic performance on benchmark networks with latent variables. The performance of the information-theoretic method miic was tested on benchmark ancestral graphs with latent variables using partially observed real-life networks (i.e. considering some variables as hidden) as well as random networks generated with the causal modeling tool Tetrad V (<ref type="url" target="http://www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad">http://www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad</ref>). Reconstructed networks are compared to partial ancestral graphs (PAGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which are the representatives of the Markov equivalent class of all ancestral graphs consistent with the conditional independences in the available data. In practice, benchmark PAGs have been derived by hiding some variables in benchmark directed acyclic graphs (DAG) using the dag2pag function of the pcalg package with slight modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. PAGs have been generated for an increasing fraction (0% to 20%) of randomly picked latent variables having a significant topological effect on the underlying network (i.e. excluding parentless vertices with a single child or vertices without child).</p><p>The results are evaluated in terms of skeleton Precision (or positive predictive value), Prec = TP/(TP + FP), Recall or Sensitivity (true positive rate), Rec = TP/(TP + FN), as well as Fscore = 2 × Prec × Rec/(Prec + Rec) for increasing sample size from N = 10 to 50,000 data points. We also define additional Precision, Recall and F-scores taking into account the edge endpoint marks of the predicted networks against the corresponding benchmark PAGs. This amounts to label as false positives, all true positive edges of the skeleton with different arrowhead endpoint marks (i.e. arrowhead (&gt;) tail or undefined (-/) endpoint marks) as the PAG reference, TP misorient , leading to the orientation-dependent definitions TP 0 = TP -TP misorient and FP 0 = FP + TP misorient with the corresponding PAG Precision, Recall and Fscores taking into account arrowhead endpoint marks.</p><p>The alternative inference methods used for comparison with miic are the FCI algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and its recent approximate variant RFCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> implemented in the pcalg package <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The results obtained with FCI and RFCI are in fact very similar and we only present here comparisons with the more recent RFCI algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. RFCI's results are shown for an adjustable significance level α = 0.01 and using the stable implementation of the skeleton learning algorithm, as well as the majority rule for the orientation and propagation steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which give overall the best results.</p><p>For each sample size (N = 10 to 50,000) and fraction of hidden variables (0% to 20%), miic and RFCI inference methods have been tested on 20 combinations of hidden variables and 50 dataset replicates each. S1, S2 and S3 Figs give the average results over these multiple combinations of latent variables and dataset replicates and compare the reconstructed networks including orientations (solid lines) or without orientation (i.e. skeleton, dashed lines) to the theoretical PAG (or its skeleton) of the benchmark network.</p><p>Algorithmic performance on undirected benchmark networks. The performance of miic was also tested on non-causal benchmark networks reconstructed from Monte Carlo sampling of Ising-like interacting systems.</p><p>To this end, real-life causal networks, such as Alarm and Insurance, have been transformed into non-causal Ising-like networks (with binary spin variables x i = ±1) by setting pairwise interacting parameters k ij between connected variables X i and X j , so as to approximately reproduce the pairwise conditional mutual information I(X i ; X j |A X i Xj ) of the original real-life causal network. This yields benchmark networks sharing approximately the same two-point direct correlations with the original causal networks but lacking causality, as the couplings k ij between spins are all symmetric by construction.</p><p>One million configurations of these Ising-like interacting systems have been generated using Monte Carlo sampling approach. It consists in flipping a fraction of the spins randomly and accepting each newly generated configuration with probability, min (1, exp(-ΔE k )), where ΔE k = E k+1 -E k , is the interacting energy difference between successive configurations, E k ¼ À P edges i&lt;j k ij x i x j . The fraction of spins randomly flipped (*10%) has been ajusted to ensure that about half of the newly generated configurations are accepted at each Monte Carlo iteration, in order to efficiently sample configuration space. This leads, however, to significant correlations between successive accepted configurations with a roughly exponential decay between n distant samples,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">C(n) ' C(0)exp(-n/R) = C(0)α n , where CðnÞ ¼ Cðk À 'Þ ¼ h P i dx ð'Þ i dx<label>ðkÞ</label></formula><p>i i is the average autocorrelation with lag between the kth and ℓth samples (with n = k-ℓ), where dx ðkÞ i ¼ x ðkÞ i À " x i . The effective number of independent samples N Ã eff can then be estimated through the apparent increase of variance between the N partially correlated samples as <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">V N ¼ 1 N 2 X k X ' h X i dx ðkÞ i dx ð'Þ i i ¼ 1 N 2 X k X ' Cðk À 'Þ ¼ 1 N Cð0Þ þ 2 1 À 1 N Cð1Þ þ 2 1 À 2 N Cð2Þ þ Á Á Á þ 2 N CðN À 1Þ !<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>leads for a first order Markov process with C(n) = C(0)α n to,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">V N ¼ Cð0Þ N 1 þ 2 1 À 1 N a þ 2 1 À 2 N a 2 þ Á Á Á þ 2 N a NÀ 1 !

Yet, as the presence of correlations between successive samples is a priori incompatible with the requirement of independent samples in the maximum likelihood framework, we have first assessed miic performance over the full range of possible effective sample size, i.e. 0 &lt; N eff /N 1, for N = 1,000 to 300,000 successive samples from the one-million-long sample series.</p><p>The results are shown in S6 eff =N ' 0:068 À 0:069. Interestingly, we found that the F-score, which is a trade-off between optimizing Precision and Recall, reaches a maximum for all sample sizes (N = 1,000 to 300,000) around the predicted effective number of samples, that is when N eff =N ¼ N Ã eff =N ' 0:069, see vertical dashed lines in F-score in S6 Fig and <ref type="figure">S6</ref> Fig. We found also that the fraction of (wrongly) directed edges is close to zero at the predicted effective number of samples, N Ã eff , providing that it is not too small, i.e. N Ã eff &gt; 300. These results demonstrate that the theoretical estimate of N Ã eff , Eq 15, yields the best compromise between over-fitting and under-fitting graphical models given the finite and partially correlated available datasets. They underline also miic accuracy to discard spurious causality in observational data, even from relatively small effective numbers of independent samples, i.e. N Ã eff &gt; 300 in S6 Fig and for network skeleton (dashed lines) and oriented network CPDAG (solid lines) for a decreasing edge-specific confidence filtering, C XY = 1 (no filtering) 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001. For sample size &gt;100, confidence filtering of individual edges improves the precision (at the expense of recall) not only for the skeleton (dashed lines), as expected, but also for the oriented networks (solid lines). In addition, limited filtering, i.e. keeping edges with C XY &lt; 10 -3 -10 -2 , tends to yield equivalent F-scores as unfiltered benchmark reconstructions. For sample size &gt;100, confidence filtering of individual edges improves the precision (at the expense of recall) not only for the skeleton (dashed lines), as expected, but also for the oriented networks (solid lines). In addition, limited filtering, i.e. keeping edges with C XY &lt; 10 -3 -10 -2 , tends to yield equivalent F-scores as unfiltered benchmark reconstructions.  . Effect of BIC/MDL versus NML criteria in applications. Choosing the BIC/MDL instead of NML criterion in the three genetic network applications, Figs 2, 3 &amp; 4, leads to somewhat sparser reconstituted networks including 82% to 100% of initial edges, yet no additional edges (i.e. consistent with a lower recall), and 66% to 75% conserved edge orientations (i.e. identical -, !, and $ edges).

The results on benchmark networks are presented in Fig 1E and 1F, as well as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7 Figs. Miic outperforms classical constraint-based approaches, including its advanced approximate variant RFCI, Fig 1E, especially on networks with many underlying parameters. It achieves significantly better or comparable results with much fewer samples (Fig 1E, S1, S2 and S3 Figs), and is typically ten to hundred times faster (Fig 1F). In addition, miic's ability to learn complex ancestral networks, which require conditioning on non-adjacent variables, can be directly demonstrated on the example of Fig 1C network, S4 Fig. The complexity of miic algorithm, while difficult to evaluate exactly, proves to be linear in terms of sample size (Fig 1F) and quadratic in terms of network size for sparse graphs irrespective of the inclusion of latent variables (S5 Fig). By contrast, traditional constraint-based methods exhibit roughly quadratic complexity in terms of sample size (Fig 1F) and much steeper complexity scaling in terms of network size, especially when latent variables are included</figDesc></figure>
