<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Data assimilation (DA) integrates observations with model forecasts to produce optimized atmospheric states, whose physical consistency is critical for stable weather forecasting and reliable climate research. Traditional Bayesian DA methods enforce these nonlinear, flow-dependent physical constraints through empirical and tunable covariance structures, but with limited accuracy and robustness. Here, we introduce Latent Data Assimilation (LDA), a framework that performs Bayesian DA in a latent space learned from multivariate global atmospheric data via an autoencoder. We demonstrate that the autoencoder can largely capture nonlinear physical relationships, enabling LDA to produce balanced analyses without explicitly modeling physical constraints. Assimilation in latent space also improves both analysis quality and forecast skill compared to traditional model-space DA,</p></div>

These include 1) diffusion-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, which generate atmospheric analyses via observationguided denoising, and 2) end-to-end schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> , which treat reanalysis data as truth and learn a direct mapping from real observations and background states to analysis states. Although proven effective, these approaches still lack the rigorous incorporation of prior information as comprehensively as traditional Bayesian DA (e.g., various background uncertainties, observation uncertainty, and model dynamics), thereby limiting their ability to handle complex operational assimilation scenarios. In addition, physical constraints among atmospheric variables are learned only implicitly in these two approaches and remain difficult to enforce explicitly. These limitations highlight the importance of developing DA frameworks that can ideally combine the non-linear representational capacity of ML with the statistical rigor of traditional methods.</p><p>Latent Data Assimilation (LDA) represents a promising avenue to address these challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. Rather than operating in the original model space, LDA performs assimilation in a compact latent space learned via nonlinear encoding of high-dimensional atmospheric states using autoencoders (AEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> or variational autoencoders (VAEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. By optimizing the latent space to preserve maximal information from the input atmospheric states, LDA can potentially capture essential nonlinear dependencies among variables. This property may reduce the reliance on B matrix while still maintaining physical consistency in analyses. While LDA has shown promise in early studies, three critical questions remain unresolved. First, theoretical foundations of LDA</p><p>are not yet fully established, especially regarding the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness. Second, existing applications have been restricted to univariate or idealized systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, leaving its scalability to realistic, multivariate atmospheric problems unverified.</p><p>Third, operational feasibility for real-world assimilation and forecasting has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>In this study, we present the first practical implementation of LDA to a high-dimensional, multivariate global atmospheric setting, and investigate the factors underlying its effectiveness. We demonstrate that the latent representation, learned via nonlinear compression, enables physically consistent DA, with a near diagonal background error covariance matrix, which provides an advantage compared to the challenging task of defining an optimal background covariance matrix in model space. By analyzing the properties of latent-space increments, we show that LDA can approximate traditional DA in model space, while in practice it outperforms traditional methods in both analysis and forecasts, and is easier to implement. Finally, we investigate the impact of latent dimensionality on assimilation performance, providing practical guidelines for selecting an optimal latent space for LDA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We implement LDA by performing Bayesian assimilation in a low-dimensional representation of the atmospheric state, learned via an AE with an encoder-decoder architecture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Specifically, the encoder first compresses the high-dimensional atmospheric background fields into a latent representation, where observations are then assimilated; the decoder subsequently reconstructs the latent analysis to produce the final model-space analysis. We train the AE on ERA5 reanalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> at 1.40625°resolution, covering 69 atmospheric variables-four at the surface and five in the upper air across 13 pressure levels. The model compresses the full atmospheric state (69×256×128) into a latent space of size (34×64×32), preserving both variable structure and spatial organization.</p><p>To implement a four-dimensional (4D) LDA and evaluate its ability to support accurate weather forecasts, we train an end-to-end forecast model using the same ERA5 dataset employed for AE training. The model architecture follows FengWu <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, a Swin Transformer-based medium-range AI weather prediction system. While such end-to-end models exhibit strong forecasting skill <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, their limited ability to propagate small initial perturbations and accurately represent the ensemble spread has been noted in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>. Accordingly, we demonstrate the superiority of LDA by comparing the variational DA in model and latent spaces, using a static background error covariance estimated via the National Meteorological Center (NMC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. For clarity, we denote the variational DA methods as "3DVar" and "4DVar" when applied in model space, and as "L3DVar" and "L4DVar" when implemented in latent space. Implementation details of the AE, forecast model, and the DA methods are provided in the Methods section.</p><p>In variational DA, obtaining the optimal analysis requires inverting the B matrix, which is computationally prohibitive due to the high-dimensional nature of weather forecasting. This matrix in model space typically exhibits strong spatial and cross-variable correlations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) and is therefore often simplified into a diagonal form via empirical control variable transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> to facilitate inversion. Within the LDA framework, although the latent space can be substantially lower-dimensional than the model space, a full-rank latent background error covariance matrix (B 𝑧 ) still contains up to 10 9 elements, making direct inversion impractical. Fortunately, consistent with previous findings from single-variable LDA studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>, we find that B 𝑧 is naturally approximately diagonal, with uniformly small off-diagonal elements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). This property allows for a simple yet accurate approximation of B -1  𝑧 by taking the reciprocals of its diagonal entries. Consequently, all subsequent LDA experiments adopt this diagonalized form of B 𝑧 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Superiority of assimilation in latent space over model space</head><p>We first evaluate the effectiveness of LDA using observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>, a standard framework for benchmarking DA methods under controlled and idealized conditions.</p><p>In these experiments, the ERA5 reanalysis is treated as the true atmospheric state for validation, from which synthetic observations are sampled based on the location of the GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System). In each experiment, observations from four time steps at six-hour intervals are assimilated into a 54-hour forecast initialized from the ERA5 reanalysis, after which a 10-day free forecast is performed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> shows the mean percentage reduction in analysis and forecast errors for each DA method, relative to a control run without assimilation, averaged over daily OSSEs conducted throughout 2017. Overall, the variational DA methods perform substantially better in the latent space than in the model space, for both analyses and forecasts. In particular, this advantage is particularly pronounced in L4DVar, which reduces the analysis error by an average of 5.1% relative to 4DVar and maintains its superiority throughout the forecast period for most variables. In contrast, L3DVar achieves a 3% reduction in analysis error compared to 3DVar and shows reduced improvement in forecast persistence. These results indicate that the model dynamics can be effectively utilized and play a significant role in LDA.</p><p>Beyond idealized OSSEs, we further evaluate the performance of LDA using real surface and radiosonde observations from GDAS throughout 2017. After quality control and interpolation (see Methods for details), the processed dataset includes over 400 upper-air and 3,000 surface observations with an interval of 12 hours. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> evaluates 10-day forecasts initialized from L4DVar and 4DVar analyses against all conventional observations collected by GDAS. Both methods improve forecast skill, with L4DVar consistently outperforming 4DVar, across nearly all variables. Interestingly, although L4DVar and 4DVar produce noticeably different analyses at the end of assimilation, their forecast errors become statistically similar in the early hours-in contrast with OSSEs, where the advantage of L4DVar progressively amplifies during the initial forecast steps. A likely explanation is that LDA analyses, derived from real observations, deviate from the ERA5 distribution used to train the ML-based forecast model, leading to a model adjustment that temporarily narrows the performance gap.</p><p>To evaluate the analysis capability of LDA, we conducted cycling assimilation experiments throughout 2017, with a 48-hour DA window comprising four observation steps. The accuracy of the resulting analysis fields from L4DVar and 4DVar was validated using observations withheld from assimilation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Across all pressure levels and time steps, L4DVar produces more accurate analyses than 4DVar for 54 of the 69 variables, with a mean reduction in error approximately 5%.</p><p>These results highlight the practical superiority of LDA in both idealized and real-world settings, supporting its potential as a more effective alternative to traditional DA frameworks.</p><p>Since the AE in LDA is trained in an unsupervised manner, we conduct a proof-of-concept experiment to examine whether LDA remains effective when the AE is trained on less accurate data. Specifically, we compare the LDA performance using an AE trained on ERA5 reanalysis versus one trained on 4-day forecasts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). Remarkably, despite the fact that the forecast data exhibiting substantially larger errors than ERA5, L4DVar based on the forecast-trained AE produces reanalyses of comparable quality to those based on ERA5-and still outperforms traditional 4DVar.</p><p>More importantly, LDA yields reanalyses that are significantly more accurate than the data used for training. These results suggest that, given sufficient observations, LDA can enhance the accuracy of analysis products beyond the limitations of the training data. An expanded version of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, covering a more comprehensive set of variables across multiple vertical levels, is provided in figs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical consistency of LDA</head><p>In model-space DA, physical balance among variables is implicitly enforced through the covariance structure of B, which becomes nearly diagonal in latent space. To evaluate whether LDA maintains physical consistency under such a diagonal B 𝑧 , we conducted single-observation experiments with L3DVar. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> shows the analysis increment resulting from a +200𝑚 2 /𝑠 2 geopotential height perturbation at 500 hPa, centered over China (left) and Australia (right). The geopotential height increment decays radially from the perturbation center, inducing anticyclonic wind anomalies.</p><p>Notably, the wind response reverses direction between hemispheres, consistent with geostrophic balance at 500 hPa. The lower panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> displays the associated temperature increment, which closely follows the background wind flow. Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref> presents the same observation increment as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, but under a different background state, leading to a distinct analysis increment. These results show that, even with a diagonal and static B 𝑧 , LDA can produce physically consistent and flow-dependent analyses through the state-varying encoding, suggesting that physical constraints is implicitly encoded in the latent space.</p><p>These findings imply that the latent representation captures the inter-variable dependencies directly, making it unnecessary to rely on a complex B 𝑧 covariance to enforce physical constraints.</p><p>Instead those constraints are learned through the encoding process. To verify this hypothesis, we first analyze the impact of each latent variable (i.e., the first dimension of the latent state) on atmospheric variables. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>, each latent variable consistently influences specific atmospheric variables to varying degrees, indicating that the latent representation captures intervariable dependencies critical for maintaining physical consistency. Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref> shows that different latent variables exert approximately orthogonal influences, revealing the decorrelation effect of the encoding.</p><p>To further investigate the inherent physical constraints of the latent representation, we test the ability of the AE to reconstruct physically unbalanced atmospheric states. Specifically, we replace one variable in an ERA5 sample with its spatial mean and evaluate the reconstruction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). The results indicate that the averaged Z500 field is accurately recovered, while Q500 is not, reflecting differences in their dependency on other variables. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, the geopotential height (Z500), which exhibits strong vertical and inter-variable correlations, can be largely reconstructed even from an unphysical averaged input. In contrast, the specific humidity (Q500), being more independent, proves much harder to reconstruct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why LDA works?</head><p>Although LDA achieves promising results in both analysis and forecast accuracy, its underlying mechanism remains unclear, raising potential questions about its overall reliability. A central challenge stems from the fact that LDA solves the optimal analysis in the latent space, without guaranteeing that decoding the optimal latent state will yield an optimal analysis in model space as well. Mathematically, we demonstrate that LDA and traditional model-space assimilation are equivalent if and only if the decoder 𝐷 (•) is locally affine and error-free throughout the assimilation process, under an assumption of zero decoding error (see Supplementary Text).</p><p>This theoretical insight motivates us to evaluate the local behavior of the decoder along latent space increments Δ𝒛 that captures leading modes of atmospheric variability, which dominate the structure of DA updates. To this end, we construct Δ𝒛 by differencing latent states from randomly selected ERA5 reanalysis samples, and examine their effects on the decoded outputs. Extensive experiments reveal two key properties: the decoder response is approximately additive with respect to latent increments and nearly homogeneous in magnitude, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>. Additional examples and statistical results provided in the Supplementary Materials (fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">tabel S1</ref>) indicate that the decoder behaves approximately affine near each latent state 𝒛 along directions of Δ𝒛. This behavior can be explained by a first-order Taylor expansion: a continuous function, including highly nonlinear neural networks, is approximately affine within sufficiently small regions.</p><p>To estimate the valid range of the decoder linearity, we test whether scaled latent increments 𝑘 •Δ𝒛 produce proportionally scaled outputs. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, the decoder exhibits approximate affine behavior across a broad range of 𝑘 along latent directions Δ𝒛 that represent dominant atmospheric variability. Given that DA analysis increments in model space reflect similar underlying variability but are much smaller in magnitude, the corresponding latent increments in LDA are expected to align with the directions of the tested Δ𝒛 and remain within the decoder's locally affine regime. Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref> supports this by showing that in both OSSE and real-observation experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>), the resulting analysis increments follow directions where the decoder is locally affine around the background state. These findings suggest why LDA can effectively and stably approximate the model-space optimal analysis in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Latent Dimensionality on LDA</head><p>The dimensionality of the latent space is a key parameter that influences the LDA performance. To investigate its effects, we evaluate both analysis and forecast skill using AEs trained with varying compression ratios. As the latent space is three-dimensional in this study, we evaluate multiple spatial compression ratios 𝐶 spatial under each fixed total compression ratio 𝐶 total . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5A-C</ref>, LDA consistently outperforms traditional DA across a wide range of compression ratios, demonstrating strong robustness. L4DVar, which incorporates model dynamics, exhibits notably lower sensitivity to compression ratios than L3DVar. Interestingly, as 𝐶 total increases, LDA performance initially improves and then declines, regardless of 𝐶 spatial , with the optimal value consistently being around 32, across all experimental settings. The existence of an optimal latent size in LDA reflects a trade-off between two competing effects induced by AE compression. On the one hand, it can increase the reconstruction error due to information loss during encoding (Fig. <ref type="figure">5D</ref>), which may degrade the analysis quality. On the other hand, compression enhances the decorrelation of latent variables, supporting the validity of diagonalizing B 𝑧 . This effect is illustrated in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>, where increasing 𝐶 spatial reduces spatial correlations in B 𝑧 . As the LDA performance initially improves with increasing 𝐶 total (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A-C</ref>), this suggests that the decorrelation effect dominates at first. However, since this benefit saturates (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>), the reconstruction error grows continuously. As a result, an optimal latent size always exists and can be efficiently identified via binary search <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</p><p>We note that a patch-like increment sometimes emerges in single-observation experiments when the latent variable dimension exceeds that of the model space (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S11</ref>), likely due to the ViT-based architecture of the AE. While this effect is mitigated with dense observations and remains acceptable in our experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A-C</ref>), we recommend compressing both variable and spatial dimensions when using ViT-based AEs. Accordingly, we adopt a latent size of 34×64×32 in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Advances in DA rely on the integration of new sources of information, yet few methodological breakthroughs have emerged in the past two decades. The rapid development of ML and the increasing availability of atmospheric data offer a new opportunity to revolutionize DA. In this study, we construct a latent representation of the global atmosphere using an AE trained on decades of ERA5 reanalysis and perform DA directly in this latent space. We demonstrate that LDA enables physically constrained analyses and holds great potential for improving both analysis and forecasting tasks.</p><p>While this study demonstrates that Bayesian DA in latent space can approximate the accuracy its counterpart in the model space, our experiments indicate that latent-space assimilation offers superior practical performance. This improvement can be attributed to their fundamental differences in the treatment of atmospheric inter-variable correlations. Traditional DA frameworks depend on the quality of the background covariance B to define a physically constrained solution space <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. However, accurately estimating B remains extremely challenging due to its high dimensionality and flow-dependent characteristics. In contrast, the latent space learned by the AE naturally encodes these non-linear physical relationships through the compression process. As a result, in LDA, B 𝑧 in LDA primarily characterizes the magnitude of background uncertainty rather than enforcing physical consistency, and can therefore be effectively diagonalised. This enables LDA to be a simpler, more physically consistent, and more effective alternative to traditional model-space DA approaches. It is worth noting that the B 𝑧 used in this study retains some spatial and cross-variable correlations. Decomposing these components as in traditional variational DA (49) may further improve LDA performance.</p><p>The effectiveness of the LDA relies on two empirical properties: the approximate affinity of the decoder in DA process and the near-diagonal structure of B 𝑧 . While these properties are difficult to guarantee, similar findings have been reported across LDA studies involving different variables, scales, and AE architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>, suggesting that such behaviors may be general under certain conditions. A possible explanation for the decoder's local affinity is that assimilation increments are typically small compared to climatological variability, allowing the decoder to be well-approximated by a first-order Taylor expansion along directions that represent atmospheric variability. The near-diagonal structure of B 𝑧 likely arises from the AE's compression objective, which promotes decoupling among atmospheric variables, as evidenced by the latent impact analysis in fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>. These characteristics underpin the potential of LDA to generalize to more complex Earth system models, including high-resolution atmospheric and oceanic simulations.</p><p>Many existing end-to-end DA methods are trained to reproduce the reanalysis used as labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref> and therefore struggle to exceed its accuracy, regardless of the amount of observations assimilated. In contrast, LDA employs an unsupervised AE that only requires high-fidelity input data with physically consistent atmospheric structures, without relying on accurate analyses or real observations. Even when the AE is trained on forecasts with substantial errors, LDA can still produce reliable analyses-only slightly less accurate than those based on reanalysis-trained models and significantly outperforming its own training data. This suggests that, with more assimilated observations, LDA has the potential to surpass existing reanalysis products such as ERA5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, which are based on 4DVar. Moreover, this capability is especially valuable in data-sparse or underdeveloped regions, where long-term reanalysis is difficult and expensive to construct, but physically consistent mesoscale forecasts initialized from global analyses remain accessible.</p><p>While LDA demonstrates notable advantages over both traditional and ML-based DA methods, its effectiveness remains limited by several factors, including the AE reconstruction error, the Gaussian assumption of background errors in latent space, and the architecture of the AE network. These challenges underscore the need for continued advancements in AE design to further improve assimilation performance. In addition, the current implementation of L4DVar requires a differentiable forecasting model, limiting its applicability to ML-based systems. As physics-informed neural models and end-to-end forecasting frameworks continue to advance-and increasingly demonstrate potential to replace traditional CPU-based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref>-this constraint is expected to diminish. We believe LDA provides a promising pathway toward next-generation DA systems, with the potential for integration into high-resolution, hybrid Earth system models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reanalysis dataset, forecast model, and observations</head><p>The AE, forecast model, and OSSE experiments are all based on ERA5 reanalysis data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, with a spatial resolution of 1.4°latitude/longitude encompassing a global grid of 128 × 256 points. This dataset comprises 69 variables: four surface variables and five upper-air atmospheric variables across 13 pressure levels (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 850, 925, and 1000 hPa).</p><p>The surface variables included 2-meter air temperature (t2m), 10-meter wind (u10, v10), and mean sea-level pressure (msl), while the upper-air variables included geopotential height (Z), temperature (T), zonal wind (U), meridional wind (V), and specific humidity (Q). ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2015 were used to train the AE and forecast model, with 2016 reserved for validation and 2017 for testing and data assimilation experiments. The dataset was used at hourly resolution for AE training and 6-hourly resolution for the forecast model.</p><p>Our ML-based forecast model follows the architecture of FengWu <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, which employs a modality-specific design with separate Swin Transformer (57) encoders and decoders for each atmospheric variable, and fuses cross-variable information via a combination of Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer blocks. Unlike the original FengWu model, which takes atmospheric states from two consecutive time steps as input, our implementation uses only a single time step to support 4DVar assimilation. Furthermore, since our study involves cyclic DA to generate analysis and requires high-fidelity forecast data to train the AE, we do not apply multi-step autoregressive fine-tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>, which may smooth out the forecasts.</p><p>The global observations for the assimilation experiments are sourced from GDAS in 2017. As a preliminary investigation, only surface and radiosonde observations with the BUFR codes of "ADPUPA" and "ADPSFC" are utilized. All observations are interpolated onto the model state grid for simplicity, and redundant observations falling within the same grid point are averaged to reduce sampling noise. High-elevation surface observations are treated as upper-air observations after altitude interpolation. In real-observation assimilation experiments, we discard observations whose deviations from ERA5 analyses exceed variable-specific thresholds to ensure assimilation stability. These thresholds are defined as the mean absolute difference between ERA5 analyses separated by 48 hours, computed over the year 2016 for all 69 variables. To account for representativeness errors and interpolation uncertainties associated with terrain effects, thresholds for surface observations are inflated by a factor of four. Post-processing finally yielded over 3000 surface and 400 radiosonde observations every 12 hours.</p></div>

As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>, the distribution of background errors projected onto the latent space is unimodal and symmetrical, supporting the use of a Gaussian prior as a reasonable modeling choice.</p><p>For the likelihood, we recall that the observations are related to the latent variable through a composition of the decoder D and the observation operator H , i.e., 𝒙 = D (𝒛), followed by H (𝒙).</p><p>Assuming Gaussian observational errors with mean zero and covariance R, the likelihood becomes:</p><p>Combining the prior and likelihood, the posterior takes the form:</p><p>Taking the negative log-likelihood (up to a constant), we obtain the L3DVar cost function:</p><p>Compared to the derivation of conventional 3DVar in model space, L3DVar differs in two aspects: 1) it assumes the prior distribution in the latent space rather than the model space, and 2)</p><p>Substituting Eq.(S9), J D (𝒛 𝑎 -𝒛 𝑏 ) = 𝒙 L3DVar 𝑎 -𝒙 𝑏 , and D (𝒛 𝑎 ) = 𝒙 L3DVar 𝑎 into Eq.(S8), we obtain:</p><p>Comparing Eq. (S10) and Eq. (S12), we conclude that if the decoder is affine during the DA process, then L3DVar and 3DVar yield the same solution in model space.</p><p>Proof of necessity A first-order Taylor expansion of the decoder at 𝒙 𝑎 gives:</p><p>where 𝜺 denotes the higher-order residual of the Taylor expansion, which depends on both 𝒛 𝑎 and 𝒛. Assume:</p><p>As a result,</p><p>We can then express the background covariance as:</p><p>where, 𝝃 = J D (𝒛 𝑡 -𝒛 𝑎 )(𝜺 2 -𝜺 1 ). Therefore,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4</head><p>We now derive a necessary condition under which the solutions of L3DVar and 3DVar coincide.</p><p>By combining Eq.(S7) and Eq.(S8), we obtain the following criterion:</p><p>Left-multiplying Eq.(S20) by J D B 𝑧 , we obtain:</p><p>Substituting Eq.(S15) and Eq.(S19) in Eq.(S21) yields:</p><p>After simplification, we obtain:</p><p>To ensure D (𝒛 𝑎 ) = 𝒙 𝑎 , Eq.S22 must hold for arbitrary DA scenarios. If D is locally affine in the DA process, the residuals 𝜺 1 and 𝜺 2 vanish by construction, making both terms zero and satisfying the condition. Conversely, if D is not affine, the residuals do not vanish in general, and the left-hand side becomes a sum of positive semi-definite matrices that cannot cancel for arbitrary 𝒛 𝒂 and 𝒛 𝒃 . For neural network-based decoders, which are generally nonlinear, this condition is almost impossible to satisfy. Therefore, Eq. S22 establishes a necessary condition for the decoder to behave affinely during the DA process, ensuring the equivalence between L3DVar and 3DVar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extension to EnKF and 4Dvar</head><p>In the 3DVar case, the proof primarily hinges on the transformation between the background covariance matrices in model space and latent space. Importantly, the result does not rely on the specific form of the observation term, which can be arbitrary. Therefore, this proposition naturally extends to the 4DVar framework, where the structure of the cost function remains similar except for the inclusion of time-evolving dynamics. For the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), it has been shown that the analysis update is theoretically equivalent to that of 3DVar under the linear-Gaussian assumption. As a result, the same affine condition on the decoder remains valid in the EnKF setting as well.          </p></div>			</div>
