<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main objective of this study is to show the impact of human factor on JIT implementation by highlighting the best practices deployed JIT organizations and benefits obtained. The critical success factors (CSFs) or activities executed by manufacturing organizations during the process of JIT implementation are studied and grouped as three latent variables that are: human resources, management commitment, and relations with suppliers. The benefits obtained are also studied and grouped as three latent variables: benefits in production process, benefits in inventory management and economic benefits. A case study is conducted in the Moroccan automotive and aerospace industries. Furthermore, the study proposes a structural equations model that presents the human factor as the most important factor in JIT implementation and is proposed as the initial independent latent variable, being in interaction with other CSFs and benefits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.Benefits obtained from JIT</head><p>Numerous papers have reported the various kinds of advantages and benefits that companies in different sectors can obtain from a successful JIT implementation. This study present 19 main benefits in a period of 33 years of JIT practices, which were identified from different papers and industrial contexts. The list of reported benefits is hierarchically classified in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> according to the number of times that they were cited by authors.</p><p>The first benefit reported by authors is "increase in productivity", is ranked in the first place according to Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, cited by 17 authors. "Reduction in inventory" is ranked in the second place, with 13 works, while "increase product quality" holds the third place since it was addressed by 12 works. Similarly, "reduction of waste and rework", "product cost reduction", and "increase in quality process" hold the fourth place, since they all reported 10 citations.</p><p>On the other hand, benefits such as "increase profitability", "Increase inventory turnover", and "reduction in inventories discrepancies" were cited merely once. However, such low quotation does not indicate their less importance or impact. It may be more suitable to consider that these benefits are rather consequences of others.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>The methodology adopted for this research includes the development of a data collection instrument (questionnaire) based on critical success factors (CSF) and benefits presented in the literature review. Then, managers from various companies were interviewed to gather information that will be analyzed using structural equations modeling (SEM). As a result, the methodology for this research includes four steps discussed in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1.Development of the survey</head><p>The questionnaire preparation is based on a literature review that aims to identify the key factors for the successful implementation of JIT and the benefits gained. The questionnaire is divided into three main sections: The first one is designed to collect demographic data about the company. The second section deals with the critical success factors or activities that must be undertaken to ensure the successful implementation of JIT. And, the last section looks at the measurement of the benefits gained when these actions are performed.</p><p>The purpose of this stage is to develop a valid questionnaire, based on Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and benefits identified by authors in previous studies. Three latent variables were identified for CSFs and were extracted from Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Those variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> with the items that are used to measure them. And three latent variables for benefits were identified from Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and they appear in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> with their items. This review of the literature represents a rational validation of the questionnaire used to collect data <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Li et al. 2005)</ref>. The questionnaire is designed to be answered using a five-point Likert-based scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Likert 1932)</ref>. The lower value (1) indicates that such CSFs was not undertaken during JIT implementation, or that such benefit was not obtained. Five, on the other hand, demonstrates that the CSF was permanently executed during JIT implementation or that the benefit was obtained as a result of JIT implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent variables Items</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.Conducting the survey</head><p>For data gathering, the following inclusion criteria are used to define the sample for this research.</p><p>-Only enterprises importing raw materials and exporting finished products are included.</p><p>-These enterprises should have a supply chain or a materials department.</p><p>-Only enterprises with an established JIT system are taken into consideration. In other words, the sampled enterprises have been applying the JIT for more than 5 years.</p><p>The final questionnaire is administered to 251 Moroccan manufacturing firms between January 05 to August 30, 2019. The questionnaire is delivered using a variety of approaches.</p><p>The first one consists in face-to-face interviews with responders after pre-established appointments. The second approach consists of e-mails sent to some enterprise managers to answer within 2 weeks, and responders are called at different times to collaborate every day from the moment they received the questionnaire the first time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3.Data gathering and validation of the instrument.</head><p>The main purpose of this stage is to validate the internal consistency or reliability of the questionnaire. Descriptive analysis of collected data is carried out using a database in SPSS22.0* software. The first step in the validation process is rational validity, which is performed as part of the literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lévy and Varela, 2003)</ref> and implemented during the questionnaire development process.</p><p>A series of tests are performed to detect missing values before using the data. These values are replaced by the median value as a measure of central tendency because the data are represented in an ordinal Likert scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jebb et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In order to determine internal consistency, a statistical validation process is carried out by calculating the Cronbach's alpha index (CAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hair et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cronbach, 1951)</ref> with a minimum acceptable value of 0.8. In addition, some tests were performed to identify items that may be rejected to improve the CAI, because some items are closely correlated with others, or that they have very little variance. Thus, removing them will improve the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Nunnally and Bernstein, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire were determined using the Cronbach alpha index (CAI) for each latent variable. In addition, the loadings values and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) were used to assess convergent validity, with a minimum acceptable value of 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kock 2012)</ref>. Also, the average variance extracted (AVE) was used to evaluate discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Berghman et al., 2012)</ref>. And, the Q-squared coefficient was calculated for each endogenous latent variable to evaluate the predictive validity. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kock (2012)</ref>, the calculated Q-squared values must be greater than zero and preferably extremely close to the estimated R-squared values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.4.Structural equations model</head><p>In order to establish relations between the CSFs of JIT and the benefits gained, a structural model is developed. The author's personal experience forms the basis for the relationships shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, but the PLS method is used to assess them. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>The survey's findings are divided into three main sections, and the results are thoroughly explained in the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1.Sample description</head><p>A total of 251 valid questionnaires coming from Moroccan companies were used for the survey. Their sectors and headcounts are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. Notably, there were 100 enterprises in the automotive sector, 89 in the electronic, and 62 in the aeronautic. According to the job descriptions of the respondents, the engineering and supervision departments were the first two most examined in the sample, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. The largest group of respondents-106-clearly consists of employees who have held their positions for more than ten years. They are followed by a group of 76 workers who have held their positions between five and ten years. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.Survey validation</head><p>Before being used, data collected was subject to a validation process. All Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability values are over 0.7, which is regarded as the lowest cutoff value.</p><p>Thus, the questionnaire could be considered as a reliable data collection tool. The survey also exhibits discriminant and convergent validity, and the values for AVE were higher than 0.5 for every dimension (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>).</p><p>HR MC RS BPP BIM EB Cronbach's alpha 0,912 0,932 0,923 0,932 0,905 0,929 Composite reliability 0,938 0,944 0,942 0,943 0,934 0,946 AVE 0,790 0,678 0,764 0,623 0,778 0,778 R-squared -0,133 0,166 0,349 0,230 0,661 Q-squared -0,08 0,101 0,196 0,188 0,458  Moreover, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref> presents the R-squared for each dependent latent variable, making it simple to observe the similarity between R-squared and Q-squared. Also, Q-squared values for dependent latent variables exceeded zero. Thus, it is possible to confirm that independent variables are explaining the dependent variables as a result of the nonparametric predictive validation.</p><p>In order to further illustrate the convergent validity, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref> also displays the combined loadings and cross loadings. And, as it was expected, the factors have high loading values but low cross-loadings. benefits of production process (BPP), benefits of inventory management (BIM), and economic benefits (EB) all increase by values of 0.364, 0.189, 0.083, and 0.002 units, respectively. So, based on these results, it is stated that Management Commitment (MC), which has the highest parameter value, is the variable that is most influenced by Human Resources (HR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.3.Structural equation model 4.3.1. Direct effects (hypothesis test)</head><p>Similarly, Benefits of Production Process (BPP) increase by 0.310 units, Benefits of Inventory Management (BIM) by 0.186 units, and Economic Benefits (EB) by 0.282 units for every unit increase in Management Commitment (MC) standard deviation. The other dependent latent variables can be interpreted similarly. All direct effects are presented in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>.</p><p>When we looked at the R-squared values in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we found that the variable Human Resources (HR) presents 13.3% of the explanation of Management Commitment (MC), while the variables Human Resources (HR) and Management Commitment (MC) present 16.6% of the explanation of Relation with Suppliers (RS). Human resources (HR), management commitment (MC), and relations with suppliers (RS) account for 35% of the benefits of production process (BPP) explanations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Indirect effects</head><p>Human Resources (HR), the only independent latent variable, has an impact on all the other variables, as was seen in the direct effect analysis. It is easy to observe in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> that the direct effects on Economic Benefits (EB) and Benefits in Inventory Management (BIM) are not valid (P=0,957&gt;5%, P=0,179&gt;5%), but Human resources (HR) has indirect effects through other variables, such as Management Commitment (MC) and Relation with Suppliers (RS). These indirect effects between latent variables are presented in Table <ref type="table">10</ref>. Although there is a statistically significant direct effect between human resources (HR) and the benefits of production process (BPP), it is also observed that there is an indirect effect that occurs through management commitment (MC) and relationship with suppliers (RS), which has a coefficient of 0.204. Similarly, Human Resources (HR) has an indirect effect on the variable Economic benefits (0.388) and an indirect impact on the variable Benefits of Inventory Management (BIM), which is 0.177. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HR</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>After the analyses of the model developed in this research using partial least squares in a sample of 251 enterprises, the following conclusions can be stated: H1: The relation between Human Resources (HR) and Relation with Suppliers (RS) can be confirmed from statistics by observing that when the first latent variable's standard deviation rises by one unit, the second latent variable rises by 0.226. H2: There is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that Human Resources (HR) has a direct and positive impact on Benefits of Production Process (BPP), since the second latent variable increases by 0.189 when the first latent variable's standard deviation rises by one unit.</p><p>H3: Since the P value is 0.957 &gt; 5%, there is insufficient statistical evidence for the relationship between economic benefits (EB) and human resources (HR). But, there are indirect effects that occur through the following factors: Management Commitment (MC), Relation with Suppliers (RS), Production Process (BPP), and Inventory Management (BIM), with a value of 0.388. Thus, this indicates that management commitment, relationships with suppliers, the production process, and inventory management are all initially affected by human resources before acting as mediators in the relation between human resources and economic performance, indicating that having an effective Manufacturing Process and high inventory turnover is the first step to economic performance.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kesti (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lampel and Giachetti (2013)</ref>, who have shown that Human Resources are the link that leads to Economic Performance and business success, but they are more focused because we have established a dependence relationship to Management Commitment, Relation with Suppliers, Production Process, and Inventory Management as mediator variables.</p><p>H4: Since the P value is 0.179 &gt; 0.05, there is insufficient statistical evidence for the relation between human resources (HR) and the benefits of inventory management (BIM). But there is an indirect effect that occurs through Management Commitment (MC) and Relation with Suppliers (RS), with a value of 0.177, highlighting the importance of those mediators factors in this relation.</p><p>The industrial implication of these results is that Human Resources (HR) can manage inventory and material flow along the supply chain with high efficiency. As a result, managers should focus on those resources as a source of competitive advantage and consider them to be a strategic asset <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lengnick-Hall et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, Human Resources (HR) is considered a predecessor to Inventory Management Benefits (BIM), but this depends on Management Commitment (MC) and the Relation with Suppliers (RS) that must deliver highquality products on time for the manufacturing process. These findings are in accordance with those of Wierczek ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) that reported the importance of Human Resources (HR) on the performance of supply chain. H5: There is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that Human Resources (HR) has a direct and positive impact on Management Commitment (MC), since the second latent variable increases by 0.189 when the first latent variable's standard deviation rises by one unit.</p><p>H6: There is sufficient statistical evidence to confirm that Management Commitment (MC) has a direct and positive effect on Relation with Suppliers (RS), since the second variable increases by 0.266 when the first latent variable's standard deviation rises by one unit. H7: There is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that Management Commitment (MC) has a direct and positive effect on Production Process (BPP), since the second variable goes up by 0.310 units when the first latent variable's increases its standard deviation in one unit. H8: There is sufficient statistical evidence to confirm that Management Commitment (MC) has a direct and positive effect on Economic Benefits (EB) since the second variable increases by 0.282 when the first latent variable's standard deviation increases in one unit. H9: There is sufficient statistical evidence to prove that Management Commitment (MC) has a direct and positive effect on Benefits of Inventory Management (BIM) because the second latent variable increases by 0.186 units when the first latent variable's standard deviation rises by one unit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Research contribution, limitations and future research directions</head><p>The study of JIT practices and the creation of a structural equations model will provide criteria to monitor the evolution of Moroccan companies. Additionally, companies will be able to create a list of the most important activities to set up during the implementation of JIT in order to manage the project effectively and achieve the desired results.</p><p>Despite the fact that the research focuses on a diverse variety of enterprises in the Moroccan sector, this is the study's restriction. Thus, the results can be generalized to other companies within the same country and from the same industries analyzed, but not to companies from other industries or located in other countries, where other rules may be applied. However, although this limitation has an impact on the generalization of results, the approach created in this research is typically applicable to any manufacturing company located anywhere in the world and provides a valid instrument in the field. Furthermore, future studies will include a comparative analysis of Morocco and other countries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Initial model with hypotheses Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) method was used to test the hypotheses shown in Figure 1.
