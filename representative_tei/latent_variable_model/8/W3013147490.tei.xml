<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examines the relationship between positive and negative user valence and transport mode choice behaviour. We integrate latent attitudes 'affect' and 'salience' into transport mode choice models using the framework of integrated choice and latent variable modelling and simultaneous maximum likelihood estimation methods. The results are consistent with findings in similar travel behaviour and behavioural economics literature. The study extends the findings of previous research and has demonstrated that user sentiments about public transport mode and salient public transport experiences have a significant impact on travel mode choice behaviour. It was found that private motorised users are more sensitive to overcrowding and antisocial behaviours on PT than active and PT travellers. Key attitudinal indicators influencing individual transport choice behaviour are established to guide public policy. The key indicators of Affect and Salience must be analysed and addressed through public policy to enhance PT user experience and develop services and facilities to increase the utility of PT in-vehicle travel time.</p></div>

Emotion is a conscious positive or negative reaction to an event whiles "Affect" describes an automatic response to a good or bad experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baumeister and Bushman, 2014)</ref>. Several studies have investigated the impact of emotion on human information processing, particularly in decision-making and concluded that negative experiences can impair decision-making and influence behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Damasio, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Elster, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Loewenstein, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Naqvi, Shiv and Bechara, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Resnick, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Elster (1998)</ref> confirmed the findings of Damasio and further espoused that social norms were promoted and sustained by emotions; emotions serve as the intermediary between situation and behaviour and, are essential for behavioural adaptation and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Scherer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dewall et al., 2016)</ref>. It is common knowledge that fear leads to flight while anger results in action, even when reactions could sometimes be against one's economic interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Loewenstein, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Scherer, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kahneman (2013)</ref> explained that intense emotional arousal temporarily overrides cognitive faculties or what the author calls "system two". This could serve as a functional equivalent to the suspended rational function in such circumstances swaying the perception of utility more towards emotional satisfaction rather than economic utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Elster, 1998)</ref>. The evidence above and the recent latent and hybrid choice models motivate this study. The study seeks to investigate the impact of emotional attachment on the intraurban travel behaviour of the residents of Edinburgh. The novelty of this study is the incorporation of Affect and Salience in Integration choice and latent variable (ICLV) model and the definition of key indicators underlying Affect and Salience, which drive individual choice preference beyond the traditional objective and socio-demographic variables.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: the first two sections introduce the study and presents the review of relevant literature. The third section presents the methodology and the framework adopted for the study, section four covers the descriptive analysis of the sample data followed by section five on model estimation and finally, section six presents the discussions and conclusion of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Literature Review</head><p>Baumeister &amp; Bushman (2014) defined emotion as a "conscious state that includes an evaluative reaction to an event and Affect as an automatic response to a good or bad experience". Affect could have a transient or lasting effect on the decision-maker and can consciously or unconsciously influence behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Champney and Stanney, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Davidson, Sherer and Goldsmith, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Sentiment is a form as Affect and describes an emotion a subject directly attaches to a tangible target as a result of the subject interaction with a target object. This type of Affect is categorised either as positive valence (joy, satisfaction, pleasure) or negative valence (shame, embarrassment, anger, fear, frustration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Resnick, 2012)</ref>. Sentiments, if intense, would usually emerge whenever the subject is dealing with the target in question. Similarly, we believe that any sentiment associated to a travel mode could potentially affect behaviour towards that mode, most importantly when the emotion provoked is intensely negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Liz, Joyce and Mick Smith, 2016)</ref>. Sentiments can be remarkably influential and can overrule otherwise rational course of action even in the presence of cognitive information that would suggest alternative courses of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Loewenstein, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Loewenstein et al., 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rozin, Millman and Nemeroff (1986)</ref> suggested that once a consumer attaches emotion to a decision targets, it influences the desirability of the target and become difficult to detach. Consumer's experiences with a particular product or service could create temporal or lasting emotional attachment or detachment towards the products or service, which could influence behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Liz, Joyce and Mick Smith, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ariely (2008)</ref> submits that Affect offers a possible explanation for consumer judgments, such as the zero price effect on consumers.</p><p>In transport, the rational choice theory suggests that the decision-makers evaluate the economic satisfaction of their choice set and select the mode with the highest economic satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985)</ref>. However, Elster, suggested that aside from the economic satisfaction, decisionmakers also evaluate their choice sets emotionally. If the perceived emotional satisfaction or psychic benefit of one product is found higher than the economic satisfaction of using alternate product then subject to economic limitations, the decision-maker will select the choice with the highest emotional satisfaction, contrary to logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zajonc, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Metcalfe and Dolan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Elster, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Loewenstein, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Elster (1998)</ref> investigated the role of emotion in decision making when rationality alone appears insufficient to explain a phenomenon and consequently proposed for emotion to be treated as psychic cost in a utility function similar to other cost variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Loewenstein (2000)</ref> further proposed the incorporation of emotions into the rational choice theory unless the predicted behaviour is less influenced by emotional factors. A traveller might prefer using a particular mode of travel for several reasons, including economic and environmental. However, any negative emotional encounter with such travel mode could have an incredible impact on the traveller's loyalty to the mode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Morris and Guerra (2015)</ref> investigated the effect of trip duration during travel on travellers' emotion by comparing commuter satisfaction across three modes of transportation Car, Non-motorised transport (NMT) and Public transportation (PT). The researcher found that long commuting trips significantly impact travellers emotionally and degrade the mood of commuters.</p><p>Similarly, research in behavioural science suggests that the human memory of experiences is governed by the most intense' peak' moments and final impressions in a chain of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kahneman, 2013)</ref>. Information that stands out and seems relevant affect human decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dolan et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Human behaviour is believed to be influenced by what comes to mind when options are being evaluated for decision making. Salience describes such intense, unusual, extreme or unexpected user experiences. It is proposed that any prominent (desirable or undesirable) user experience with a travel mode can have a disproportionate influence on behaviour. For instance, any encounter of provocation experienced by a passenger on a bus could have a profound consequence on their future travel behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kahneman, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Resnick (2012)</ref> explains that such undesirable experiences create negative valence and could negatively reshape the subject's future travel decisions <ref type="bibr">(Metcalfe and Dolan, 2012b)</ref>. Therefore, based on the above evidence, we hypothesise that traveller's emotional attachment to travel modes, and undesirable experiences could influence their travel behaviour.</p><p>The last two decades have witnessed a rising research interest in latent or integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) modelling, in direct response to the observed limitations of the traditional choice models in explaining the observed heterogeneity of human behaviour and individual choice preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ben-Akiva and Boccara, 1995)</ref>. Literature is replete with evidence suggesting that attitudes and perceptions significantly influence decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Manski, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ben-Akiva and Boccara, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ben-akiva et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ortuzar et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kamargianni et al., 2015)</ref>. The challenge, however, is finding the appropriate subjective variable to account for in the choice models.</p><p>This study leverages on the strength of the argument advanced above for Affect and Salience. It incorporates them as latent variables to develop an ICLV model to investigate their impact on travel mode choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Respondents</head><p>The target population of the study was residents living within the jurisdiction of the City of Edinburgh council area aged 18 years and above. The sampling frame of the survey comprised of 240,147 households stratified into 20 zones based on the 2016 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Scottish Government, 2016)</ref>. The SIMD postcode lookup table is an area-based tool for identifying areas with similar socio-demographic characteristics. It uses information such as income, education and crime levels to assign scores to data zones and postcodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Campbell et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Scottish Government, 2016)</ref>. The SIMD postcode lookup table was used to classify the sample frame into socio-economic zones for sampling and to ensure a proportional and representative sample.</p><p>Households were drawn at random from each zone (stratum) to generate the sample. The number of addresses drawn from each stratum was based on its respective weighting in the sampling frame to ensure proportional representation of the sample. 4,155 household addresses were sampled for the study, out of which 3,973 addresses were successfully accesed and delivered a questionnaire to complete and return by mail to the researcher using a Printed Postage Impressions (PPIs) enclosed with the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Questionnaire design</head><p>The survey instrument was designed to collect socio-demographic data, transport characteristics and information for attitudinal profiling (Affect, Salience, Norms and Narcissism) for intraurban trips . The first section of the questionnaire sought information on trip and travel characteristics including the main mode of travel and secondary mode of travel in the absence of the main mode. The second section covers user perception of PT service quality (Affect), PT user experience and its effects (Salience), user perception on transport and environmental norms of the study area (Norms) and statements on Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) for estimating repondents' NPI score (Narcissism); These measurement scales were measured on a five-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree). However, this study only investigates the impact of Affect (measured with 6 indicators) and Salience (measured with 8 indicators). The final section of the survey instrument asked for information necessary to understand the socio-demographics of the sample, questions such as gender, age, marital status, highest education qualifications, annual household income, employment status and household size were asked. This information is used in conjunction with other relevant variables to investigate the travel behaviour of the study population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Sample characteristics 4.1 Socio-demographic</head><p>In total, 551 completed questionnaires were received from respondents aged between 18 and 90 (μ=49.69, σ=17.45). Fifty-one partially completed responses were discarded from the sample data. This reduced the total valid responses to 500 cases at a response rate of 12.6%. Although the response rate is consistent with postal or mail back survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(David De Vaus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sahlqvist et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Larson and Poist, 2018)</ref>, it is below the study's expectation of 17%. The researchers suspect that the sensitivity of some of the indicators for measuring the attitudinal constructs may have influenced the non-response.</p><p>All respondents met the minimum legal age of 17 for obtaining a driver's licence in the UK. It was observed that 82.8% of respondents own either full or provisional driving licence. 13.5% have never held a licence, 3.4% have surrendered their licence and none was disqualified from driving. This indicates that at least 96.3% of respondents are legally eligible to own a car and drive in the study areaThe next section presents a descriptive analysis of the sample data.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> reports the characteristics of the study population and indicates that there are fewer males than females in the sample. A total of 349 participants, representing 69.2% of respondents reported having at least one car available for commuting. This statistic is slightly different from similar figures from Transport <ref type="bibr">Scotland (Transport Scotland (2018b)</ref>. However, a chi-square test conducted (x 2 = 1.916 at a p-value of 0.853) suggested both data sets come from the same population; thus, the data set is representative of the study population. A comparison of the estimates on car ownership was insignificant with a chi-square value of 1.19 at a p-value of 0.756 <ref type="bibr">(Transport Scotland, 2018b)</ref>. Similarly, it was found that 35% of participants commute by driving, while 32% of them reported taking the bus or tram. The sample data was found not to significantly differ from similar data from Transport Scotland <ref type="bibr">(Transport Scotland, 2018a)</ref>. The study further investigated the household income of participants and compared the sample data with similar records from the Scottish Government (Scottish Government, 2018) (x 2 = 2.737 at a p-value of 0.603). The sample estimates on education show a high proportion (62.7%) of respondents with at least first degree. Although the distribution of the population by educational attainment could not be sourced and compared with the sample data, CoEC (2018) indicates that 63.9% of Edinburgh's population in employment have a university degree. Again this estimate does not deviate much from the sample data. We, therefore, assume that the two datasets belong to the same population and do not differ statistically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Attitudinal variables</head><p>We investigate the effect of respondent's perception, experience and emotions about PT on their choice of travel mode for commuting. The study aims to examine any significant difference in attitude between PT users, private car users and active travellers (Non-Motorised Transport (NMT)). As indicated previously, we measured the attitudinal dataset on a 5-point ordinal scale. For this reason, we employed the Kruskal-Wallis Test to assess the differences among the three groups of commuters statistically. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect</head><p>Respondents were requested to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with the statements in table 2. Kruskal-Wallis Test was used to establish the similarities or otherwise in Affect between respondents commuting by NMT, Car and by PT. It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> that respondents differ significantly in Affect between the three groups. As can be seen three out of the six variables statistically vary considerably between the three groups at 99% confidence level; two statistically differ at 95% confidence level, and only one variable is not statistically different. In general, we assert that the measurement instrument for Affect statistically explains the difference in respondents' choice of transport mode for commuting. We observed that PT users show more affinity to PT services than car and NMT users and are more likely to rate PT services more favourably. PT and NMT commuters consider driving as demanding and believe the in-vehicle travel time of PT could be utilised for productive activities. We further observed that drivers are less sensitive to the environmental impact of their travel behaviour. NMT and PT users, on the other hand, appear more environmentally conscious and more likely to prefer PT to driving. Perhaps sensitisation from environmentalist may be necessary to address this perception gap. While PT and NMT users do not have difficulty sharing seats with strangers in PT, Car users were found to be less enthused about travelling and possibly sharing a seat with strangers in PT travel modes. This is perhaps one of the several reasons behind the choice of private motorised mode for commuting. The results indicate that active commuters and PT commuters are more likely to be satisfied with PT services than drivers. It is also shown that the level of satisfaction varies considerably by mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Transport Experience</head><p>Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which the experiences in the table below would affect or have affected their usage of the public bus. Kruskal-Wallis Test conducted on this measurement tool is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. As can be seen, respondents differ significantly in response across the three groups. Three variables statistically differ between the two groups at 99% confidence level; one statistically differs at 95% confidence level, whiles four of the variables differ at 90%. Comparing the three groups (Drivers, NMT and PT users), Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> indicates that in general, drivers and then followed by NMT users will have their loyalty to PT significantly influenced by negative passenger attitude and negative user experiences on PT. In general, drivers are more sensitive to negative and undesirable experiences associated with PT usage; they are more likely to be influenced by such these and similar experiences than PT users followed by active travellers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Mode Choice Modelling 5.1 Maximum Likelihood factor Analysis</head><p>Maximum likelihood (ML) factor analysis with Promax rotation was undertaken to extract uncorrected attitudinal constructs using SPSS. Maximum likelihood estimator is adopted because of its robustness in handling ordinal and normally distributed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dannewald et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Muthén and Muthén, 2010)</ref>. The factors were constructed using 11 out of the 14 statements used for measuring Affect and PT experiences with 500 valid responses. Three indicators: "I am uncomfortable travelling with strangers"; "Travelling in PT is boring" and "I enjoy using PT ... I get to meet people" had communalities below 0.2 and were consequently omitted from the analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Child, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yong and Pearce, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Using the scree plot, three factors explaining 65.49% of the variance were retained. The first factor, named "salient experience" (salience) accounts for 40.73% of the variance and describes participants' perception of negative experience on public transport (bus services in Edinburgh). The second factor, "Convenience", accounts for 16.40% of the variance. This factor describes how respondents' see the travel and waiting time of public transport services. The third factor, "Affect" (PT Lovers) also accounts for 8.36% of the variance and describes respondents' perception of Bus/Tram travel and the act of driving. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the results of the factor analysis and Cronbach's Alpha test of construct reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cronbach, 1951)</ref>. Similarly, respondents belonging to and scoring high on the latent construct salient experience (salience) were found to be mostly women (61%), majority of them own at least one car (74%). A higher proportion of respondents in this class often drive (46%) compared to using PT or active modes. 59% of members in this category own Lothian bus travel pass (ridacard) or another travel pass, a possible indication of active or loyal PT users whiles, 41% of the class members do not own any form of travel pass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>Using AMOS Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) package, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the factors extracted using the maximum likelihood factor analysis. The CFA factors are used as the latent variables in the estimation of ICLV model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dobbie, McConvile and Ormston (2010)</ref> found that overcrowding, walking distance to bus stops and lack of toilets on board buses are among the barriers to PT usage in Scotland. The sample data buttresses this claim and indicates that 18.4% of respondents are concerned about the absence of seatbelts and toilets. However, the indicator "Safety issues (seatbelts, toilets)" was found to have very low factor loading during the CFA and was consequently dropped from the final CFA model. All the factors achieved composite reliability (CR) (i.e. CR&gt;0.69) and therefore considered reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Similarly, all the latent factors except Affect achieved convergent validity (i.e. average value extracted, AVE &gt;0.50) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Malhotra and Dash (2011)</ref> suggest that due to the strictness of AVE, reliability can be assumed if a factor achieves CR. Therefore, following the advice of Malhotra and Dash, reliability is deemed established for all the factors. The assessment of discriminant (divergent) validity (the degree to which two conceptually similar concepts are distinct) found a high correlation between Salience and Convenience (square root of the AVE for salience is less than its correlation with Convenience). Thus, Salience and Convenience did not achieve discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hu and Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kline, 2011)</ref>. Convenience was, therefore, dropped from subsequent analysis as a result and due to the focus of the study. The final model satisfied all indices recommended for assessing goodnessof-fit (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hu and Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kline, 2011)</ref>, indicating that the measurement model sufficiently fits the sample data. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> below presents the results of the CFA. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Model Specification</head><p>The model estimation uses the simultaneous estimation method in Pandas Biogeme <ref type="bibr">(Bierlaire, 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bierlaire, 2018b)</ref>. We estimate an integrated choice and latent variable model (ICLV model).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Discussions</head><p>We observe from the estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> that all the utility parameters of the modal attributes, individual characteristics and the latent attitudes, i.e. travel time, cost, distance, age, education and income have plausible values and the expected signs for both models <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Johansson and Heldt, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Yáñez, Raveau and Ortúzar, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kamargianni et al., 2015)</ref>. The estimates for both models are almost similar. The exception is travel cost for private motorised mode which has the expected sign but insignificant. However, we suspect this could be due to the high proportion of older respondents in the sample data;</p><p>most older residents aged 60 and over (29.4% in the sample) are entitled to free or subsidised travel on most public transport services in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Scotland (Audit Scotland, 2010)</ref>. Most respondents in this category either reported zero or small amount as travel cost.</p><p>To make the estimated effects more understandable, we estimated both direct and cross elasticities of travel time, travel cost and distance. The elasticity estimates listed in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, indicate the percent changes in the probability of choosing an alternative given a 1% increase in an attribute of that alternative. For example, a direct elasticity of -0.511 in the ICLV model for travel time of private motorised mode implies the market share of private motorised mode reduces by 0.511% for a 1% increase in travel time. Cross elasticities show the percent changes of choosing an alternative given a 1% change in the attributes of a competing alternative. For instance, a cross elasticity of 0.337 in the ICLV model for the travel cost of private motorised mode implies that the market shares of private motorised modes will increase by 0.337% for a 1% increase in PT travel fares.</p><p>The direct time elasticities for private motorized modes for both models are higher than the ones for public transport, meaning that private motorised mode users are more sensitive to changes in their travel time and cost than users of public transport.</p><p>The travel time for private motorised mode and PT are observed to reduce the likelihood of choosing either alternative, travel time minimises the effect on the probability of observing either mode. The cross and direct elasticities displayed in Table <ref type="table">11</ref> support this assertion and indicates an increase in travel time of either alternative will result in the reduction of demand. The values of the cross elasticity of demand of the alternatives suggest that private motorised mode and PT mode are substitute alternatives. The increase in the travel time of either alternative will increase demand for the alternative mode.</p><p>The results also reveal that active travelling is negatively impacted by trip length. The average walking and cycling distance were observed to be 3.4km and 5.6km respectively, while that for Private motorised mode and PT were 12.6km and 10.7km respectively. The results indicate that respondents are likely to walk for shorter distances. However, as distance increases beyond the acceptable threshold, the respondents will either drive or go by PT.</p><p>Work-related trips are found to reduce the utility for private motorised modes. This is intuitive due to the frequent and routine nature of such trips. They are more repetitive and less likely to change from dayto-day. The unemployed and the retired who do not make such regular trips were found to behave differently, possibly because they are less professionally active. The estimate for the trip characteristics (trip frequency) sheds more light on the argument above; frequent trips reduces the utility of private motorised mode.</p><p>The age of an individual is observed to have a significant impact on the likelihood to use active modes.</p><p>Older individuals are less likely to use active modes of transport compared to younger individuals, possibly due to age-related mobility difficulties.</p><p>The educational level of individuals was found to have a significant impact on the choice of mode. It is seen that highly educated individuals tend to use active travel modes more, this is consistent with the conclusion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atasoy et al. (2013)</ref>. The higher the educational qualification of an individual, the more likely they are to choose an active or environmentally friendly mode of transport. Individuals in this class tend to be more sensitive to the environmental footprints of their behaviour, which is believed to explain the reason behind this observation.</p><p>The link between household income and car availability is well established in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ben-Akiva et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ortuzar and Willumsen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kamargianni et al., 2015)</ref>. The results confirm this finding and indicate that the higher the income of an individual, the more likely they are to own a car and, consequently, less likely they are to travel by public transport mode. The estimate of car availability increases the utility for private motorised mode and the likelihood of driving.</p><p>The combined walking time/distance from the trip origin to the first bus stop and the walking distance from the destination bus stop to the final trip destination has been observed to have a significant effect on the utility of a car. Increase in the total walking time increases the utility of car and the likelihood of driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Yáñez, Raveau and Ortúzar, 2010)</ref>. This effect is significant at 95% level in the base model and the ICLV model.</p><p>The latent attitude, Affect/PTLovers is observed to increase the utility of public transport and decreases the utility of private motorised mode. Individuals with positive valence towards public transport (high level of satisfaction for public transport services) have high utility for public transport in-vehicle travel time <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Resnick, 2012)</ref>. Additionally, environmentally conscious individuals use public transport more. This effect correlates with socio-demographic variables such as age and educational level; highly educated individuals tend to be more mindful of their carbon footprint.</p><p>The results suggest that salient experience on public transport represented by salience is found to decrease the utility of public transport mode. Experiences like anti-social behaviour, passenger annoyance and overcrowding on a bus could induce negative valence (such as the feeling of anger, embarrassment, frustration or fear). This could potentially hurt passenger loyalty. This observation is consistent with the findings in behavioural economics literature, which suggests that unusual and undesirable experience stays longer in human memory and looms more significant to the subject. Such experiences create intensely negative sentiments which could override otherwise rational course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Redelmeier, Rozin and Kahneman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Loewenstein et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kahneman, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ariely (2008)</ref> argued that salience is a form of anchoring and essential for consumer decision-making. Therefore, most prominent (pleasant or unpleasant) experience on PT such as any incidents of passenger annoyance or anti-social behaviour experienced by a passenger on a bus could have a farreaching consequence on the future travel behaviour of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kahneman, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, averting such experiences and addressing passenger complaints to their satisfaction could reverse the effects of such salient experiences, the associated negative valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Resnick, 2012)</ref> and reduce the potential negative impact of the experience on future travel decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dobbie, McConvile and Ormston, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Metcalfe and Dolan, 2012a)</ref> The study has defined key indicators (critical success factors CSF) for Affect and salience, using EFA and validated through CFA. The underlying indicators of Affect and Salience significantly influence decision-making and individual choice preference. The CSFs of Affect and Salience must be examined and accounted for through transport policy to increase the perceived utility of in-vehicle travel time for PT riders. Imposing sanctions on behaviours that are likely to induce intensely negative valence towards PT modes, and introducing high capacities buses during peak hours and increasing the frequency of vehicles could prevent overcrowding on carriages and improve user experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Conclusion</head><p>We estimated and compared two transport mode choice models, MNL model and ICLV model with the inclusion of two latent attitudes. The discussions above highlights the variables used in the two models and explains the impact of each variable on the decision-making process. The results have shown that the observed modal attributes, trip characteristics and individual socio-demographic variables have a significant effect on travel behaviour. Similarly, the result also indicates that underlying attitudes and perceptions influence the choice of transport mode. This suggests that travel behaviour is equally influenced by subjective variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avineri, 2011)</ref>. Incorporating Affect, Salience and other similar latent attitudes as psychic cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Elster, 1998)</ref> in the utility function of transport modes provides an added explanatory power to the choice models. The results of the study could have implications for public transport services. Accounting for these and similar subjective factors through transport policies and services could improve PT ridership. Public transport travel time and waiting time may be unforgiving, especially during inclement weather. However, operators and planners can improve user experience by creating the enabling environment to make the in-vehicle travel time productive. Addressing overcrowding and discouraging or penalising anti-social behaviours on PT carriages could mitigate the negative impact of user's sentiments associated with such experiences.</p><p>The results presented in this paper are limited to urban trips in one city in the United Kingdom. Additionally, the sample overrepresented older people in the population and those with high educational qualification.</p><p>Similarly, the study has shown that positive user experience and service satisfaction can create positive valence and sentiments in users towards the target object; this is revealed to increase the utility of PT modes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="9,72.00,56.76,451.24,272.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
