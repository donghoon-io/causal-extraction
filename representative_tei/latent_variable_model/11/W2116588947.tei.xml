<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Design is a language that communicates to consumers and others, independent of verbal information. Hence, it is critical that marketing managers and scholars understand design's impact on viewers. In general, visual information is processed differently from, faster than, and independent of verbal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Edell and Staelin, 1983)</ref>. In addition, visual information can trigger affect prior to cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lutz and Lutz, 1977)</ref>.</p><p>Most marketing research has examined how individual design elements such as color, symmetry, proportion, and angularity affect consumers' reactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pittard et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>While such research is useful, it is like studying alphabets ─ critical to understanding but offering limited insight into word or sentence meaning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref>, in an early attempt to understand broader design characteristics, uncovered three basic design dimensions: elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony. Elaborateness refers to a design's richness and its ability to capture the essence of an object; natural designs depict commonly experienced objects; and harmony refers to the congruency of the patterns and parts of a design. Extending our analogy, these design dimensions act as words instead of letters. Preliminary evidence indicates that these design dimensions are important for understanding reactions to a variety of marketing stimuli such as typeface <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Henderson et al., 2004)</ref> and wine bottle design <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Orth and Malkewitz, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>While the evidence suggests that elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony are universal words that are useful for understanding visual marketing stimuli, we have limited evidence about whether these design dimensions exist across cultures. We also do not know if people from different cultures respond in the same way to these design dimensions. Evolutionary psychology suggests that human response to visual stimuli is genetically programmed and relatively immune from cultural influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams, 2003)</ref>. For example, we have an innate ability to determine what stimulus features provide information across several domains including evaluations of landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Orians and Heerwagen, 1992)</ref>, facial expressions of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ekman, 1998)</ref>, and physical attractiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jones, 1996)</ref>. However, some research on reactions to individual design elements find cultural differences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Perfetti et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Zhang et al., 2006)</ref>, while others such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pittard (2007)</ref> report similarities across cultures.</p><p>Given the literature's conflicting findings, our study examines whether the design dimensions uncovered by Henderson and colleagues underlie reactions to logos in ten different countries: Argentina, Australia, China, Germany, Great Britain, India, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, and the United States. Using consumer and designer ratings of 195 stimuli, we apply a Bayesian finite-mixture, structural-equation model employing an MCMC algorithm to uncover latent differences in cultural perceptions of and responses to designs. This will provide the most comprehensive and rigorous test to date of such cultural variations regarding design dimensions (as opposed to individual design elements 1 ). Specifically, we build upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref> to examine the following research questions:</p><p>1. Do the design dimensions of elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony exist crossnationally? 2. Are consumers' responses to these design dimensions stable cross-nationally?</p><p>Beyond studying the theoretical questions of design dimension universality and consumer response stability, our paper also makes a methodological contribution. Research in experimental aesthetics typically analyzes data at the stimulus level by averaging individual judgments for each stimulus (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote, 1998)</ref>. However, such an approach does not consider heterogeneity in individual responses, which will mask information contained in individual response variation. This may bias correlations between judgments about different stimuli 1 A design element is a single characteristic, while a design dimension is a combination of elements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(DeShon, 1998)</ref>. Thus, we extend finite-mixture, structural-equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DeSarbo et al., 2006)</ref> to simultaneously analyze responses at the stimuli level while accounting for individual judgment heterogeneity through an additional hierarchical layer. Our model also uses a concomitant variable specification (ter <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hofstede et al., 1999)</ref> to allow the probabilities of stimuli's latent clusters membership to vary across countries. We then use the country-specific cluster probabilities to interpret the latent clusters. Last, we assess measurement invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998)</ref> across clusters rather than across countries. This offers two advantages. First, the number of cross-national clusters is usually smaller than the number of countries if many countries are studied -so fewer computations are required and invariance testing is more tractable (invariance tests grow exponentially with the number of countries).</p><p>Second, Steenkamp and Baumgartner's framework usually selects countries a priori, while our approach is not restricted to country.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> A priori allocations may not be realistic because "consumers in different countries often have more in common with one another than with other consumers in the same country" (ter Hofstede, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Steenkamp and Wedel, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>We use logos as a context to examine the research questions. As a key component of corporate visual identity, managers employ logos to create positive emotions, convey meaning, or enhance recognition about the company and brand. However, managers have expressed uncertainty about how to manage corporate visual identity systems globally (e.g. see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alashban et al., 2002)</ref>. The literature suggests that logos are most often used in an unaltered form when going abroad <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kapferer, 1992)</ref>. Does using unaltered logos in new markets accomplish their communication goals, or would it be necessary to modify logos for individual countries? Depending on our findings, managers can either feel secure using standardized logos and other visual material or, if cross-cultural differences exist, we can provide guidelines for adapting logos to specific countries or regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Framework</head><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref>, our framework is specified at the logo level and proposes that consumers perceive logo designs along three objective design elements and three design dimensions (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The objective design elements include: repetition (number of times identical shapes are repeated), proportion (the ratio of a logo's width to its height), and parallelism (number of parallel lines). As discussed earlier, the design dimensions are elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony. The design dimensions consist of eight design elements (complexity, activeness, depth, representativeness, organicity, roundness, symmetry, and balance) measured subjectively by designers (see Appendix A). While these six characteristics (i.e., three dimensions plus three objective design elements) do not capture all aspects of design, they appear to represent a fundamental core for logo design.</p><p>We use positive affect, shared meaning, subjective familiarity, and true and false recognition to assess responses to logo designs. Positive affect is important because feelings can transfer to the product or company, especially in low-involvement decision making where affective reactions can guide choice. Prior work suggests that increasing a design's harmony, elaborateness, and naturalness creates positive affect primarily because these design changes facilitate perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anand and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sternthal, 1991, Martindale et al., 1988)</ref> and stimulate arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Raymond et al., 2003)</ref>. Natural designs may also be more pleasing, because they are more prototypical <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Seifert, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Shared meaning exists when there is a consensus among respondents regarding the first meaning or association that comes to mind when they see a logo <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ellis et al., 1974)</ref>. Logos with high shared meaning are valuable because they are perceived, interpreted, and remembered better than stimuli with varied meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rodewald and Bosma, 1972)</ref>. Naturalness, harmony, and to a lesser extent elaborateness, may increase shared meaning because universally experienced objects are more easily interpreted and recognized than abstract objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Seifert, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Shinar et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have not examined the relationship between logo design and subjective familiarity (feeling of having seen a logo before, regardless of prior exposure). Subjective familiarity can increase positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zajonc, 1968</ref>) and even enhance brand choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Henderson and Cote, 1998)</ref>. Since shared meaning and subjective familiarity are closely related, the rationale behind the relationships between the design characteristics and subjective familiarity are similar to those for shared meaning.</p><p>Logo recognition means consumers remember seeing the logo before. Because consumers recognize pictures more quickly than words, a company can communicate quickly by using a logo in the brand name <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Edell and Staelin, 1983)</ref>. We distinguish between two types of recognition: true recognition is the correct assertion that one has seen the logo before, and false recognition is the incorrect assertion that one has seen the logo before. False recognition is not necessarily a bad outcome as companies may deliberately create new logos that seem familiar.</p><p>According to Gestalt, motivational, and cognitive theories, consumers are likely to exhibit true recognition for stimuli that are easily encoded and command attention. Natural logos, are easily encoded and should increase true recognition and decrease false recognition. However, other design dimensions should have little effect on either type of recognition. This conceptual framework does not propose any cross-cultural differences. Rather, we expect that the same underlying design structure, and relationships between design characteristics and consumer responses, exist independent of where the consumer lives. We start with the framework in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and use a latent class methodology to test whether different logo clusters exist across cultures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Overview</head><p>Our conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is defined at the logo level. We follow previous studies on aesthetics <ref type="bibr">(Berlyne, 1974, Henderson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cote, 1998)</ref> to derive scores for design and responses and asked different designers and consumers to rate subjective logo design elements and responses for each individual logo. In addition, to test if perception of and response to design is invariant across cultures, we collected these data from consumers and designers in ten countries: Argentina, Australia, China, Germany, Great Britain, India, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, and the United States. These countries, on five continents, represent an array of geographic, economic, political, language, and cultural backgrounds (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>). This dataset allows a rigorous test of perceptions of and responses to logo designs. By comparison, recent international marketing research has generally involved two (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gurhan-Canli and Maheswaran, 2000)</ref> or three countries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Erdem et al., 2004)</ref>, or a limited region <ref type="bibr">(Baumgartner and</ref><ref type="bibr">Steenkamp, 2001, ter Hofstede, Steenkamp and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wedel, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>We employed 195 unfamiliar logos used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref> that were originally obtained from a book of foreign logos <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kuwayama, 1973)</ref> and Yellow Page advertisements. To minimize the effects of past exposure and to prevent confounding of symbolic with verbal processing, the logos contained no verbal material. Standard-back translation methods were used on all questionnaires-a bilingual native speaker translated the questionnaires written in English into each country's language, and then a different bilingual native speaker translated the questionnaires back into English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Ratings of Logo Design Elements</head><p>Consistent with experimental aesthetics research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berlyne, 1974)</ref>, data was collected on a large number of stimuli and variables, across multiple samples. Two or three professional logo designers in each country evaluated the degree of activeness, balance, depth, organicity, representativeness, roundness, and symmetry each logo possessed. The designers had formal training and extensive experience with commercial clients and logo design. Before rating the logos, the evaluators received a short description of each characteristic. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref>, for each country, five groups of approximately forty undergraduates evaluated the design element of complexity for a different subset of thirty-nine logos. 3 Finally, data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref> provided the three objectively measured logo design elements of parallelism, proportion, and repetition.</p><p>In summary, the eleven design elements were each measured with a single indicator. Eight of the design elements (activeness, balance, depth, organicity, representativeness, roundness, symmetry, and complexity) are country-specific and measured by different raters (either designers or students) in each country. Repetition, proportion, and parallelism are identical across countries. Appendix A defines these design elements and contains examples of logos scoring high and low on them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Responses to Logo Design</head><p>Affect and Subjective Familiarity. To minimize fatigue, each respondent rated only thirty-nine logos on the five affective items (like/dislike, good/bad, high/low quality, distinctive/not distinctive, and interesting/uninteresting), as well as subjective familiarity (familiar/unfamiliar).</p><p>Each logo appeared on a separate page with the 7-point rating scales and was evaluated by 3 This furnishes evaluations for 5 x 39 or 195 logos in total. twenty to seventy respondents (about forty on average). Shared Meaning. Shared meaning exists when respondents agree about the first meaning or association that comes to mind when they see a logo <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ellis, Parente and Shumate, 1974)</ref>. The same respondents for the affect and subjective familiarity questions listed the first meaning or association that came to mind when they looked at each logo (collected in the second half of the booklet). A trained research assistant from each country grouped similar associations. For each logo in each country, we calculated the Hirschman-Herfindahl index score by squaring and then summing across the probabilities of each response <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Henderson and Lafontaine, 1996)</ref> 4 . A high concentration index indicates that a logo evokes shared meaning.</p><p>Recognition. For each country, five groups of approximately thirty business undergraduates (different from the groups used to collect the affect, familiarity, and meaning ratings) viewed a subset of 39 logos in a slide show, with each logo appearing for two seconds. Respondents next participated in a distracter task for about ten minutes. Then they viewed a booklet with seventyeight logos-(thirty-nine target logos from the slide presentation and thirty-nine distracter logos that were not presented earlier). The students then indicated whether they had seen the logo in the slide show. True recognition is the percentage of respondents who correctly recognize a target logo, while false recognition is the percentage of respondents who claimed to recognize a distracter logo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Model</head><p>Following previous aesthetics research, our model uses logos as the primary unit of analysis. The structural relationships between logo design characteristics and consumer responses are specified using logo-level data (see Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>). Previous research averages individual ratings and 4 For example, if 50% of respondents said a logo reminded them of a sun, 30% said wheel, and 20% said star, the Hirschman-Herfindahl index would be .5 2 + .3 2 + .2 2 = .38. responses to compute each logo's design and response scores (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Henderson et al., 2003)</ref>. In contrast, our model (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) includes an additional hierarchy to analyze individual level data, thus minimizing potential aggregation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(DeShon, 1998)</ref>. 5 To test whether perceptions and evaluations of logos are similar cross-nationally, we specify a concomitant variable, finitemixture, structural-equation model that allocates logos to clusters. With fewer clusters than countries, our approach reduces the number of invariance tests relative to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998)</ref> who define clusters a priori at the country level. If logos are evaluated similarly across cultures, we will find a one-cluster solution.</p><p>We estimate our model in a Bayesian framework using an MCMC algorithm, which has several advantages over traditional methods including no asymptotic assumptions, suitability for smaller sample sizes, incorporation of prior information <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Rossi and Allenby, 2003)</ref>, and avoidance of Heywood cases (negative variances). Most importantly, Bayesian inference estimates individual-specific effects. Thus, we can obtain each individual logo's country-specific posterior distribution of factor scores and cluster probabilities. Managers can use this information to optimize individual logos on specific dimensions of interest, as shown in Section 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Model Specification</head><p>Before introducing our model, we present some notation that defines the sets and (latent) variables.

The proposed factor structure also strongly outperforms a simultaneous equation model in which no factor structure is assumed for logo design (LMD = -1,055,170). These results confirm Henderson and Cote's (1998) design factor structure with three dimensions: elaborateness (complexity, activeness, and depth), naturalness (organicity, representativeness, and roundness), and harmony (symmetry and balance). We tested for metric invariance using the LMD and found the metric invariance model (LMD = -891,403) fits better than the configural model (LMD = -891,508). This indicates that logo design characteristics are captured by the same factor structure and loadings across clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Similarity of Design-Response Relationships across Clusters</head><p>Since we found metric invariance, we can now test whether the structural paths are invariant across the three clusters. As indicated by the LMD of structural relationship invariance (LMD = -891,510), this model is rejected. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> presents the results of the metric invariance model where structural paths are different across clusters. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gelman and Pardoe (2006)</ref>, the last column contains the explained variance for each dependent factor. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows that the explained variance for each response variable varies substantially across clusters. Although there is a high degree of similarity to the pattern of relationships between design dimensions and response variables, the structural parameters have slight differences across clusters. We consider reasons for these patterns in the summary at the end of this section.</p><p>Affect. Overall, logo design dimensions and objective elements explain 84% of the variance in affect for Asia, 62% for the West, and 28% for Russia. In all clusters, affect increases as the design dimensions (harmony, elaborateness, and naturalness) increase as seen in the positive and significant structural path coefficients. However, the importance of elaborateness varies across the three clusters-the Russian cluster puts significantly less emphasis on it (.19) than the Asian (.70) and Western clusters (.54). The effects of parallelism, proportion, and repetition on affect are small and statistically equivalent across the three clusters.</p><p>Subjective Familiarity. Logo design characteristics explain 24% of subjective familiarity for the West, 35% for Russia, and 41% for Asia. The relationships for harmony and naturalness are positive and statistically significant in all three clusters. Additionally, the effects of parallelism, repetition, and proportion are not significant across the clusters. However, the relationship between elaborateness and subjective familiarity varies across clusters-the path for Russia (-0.22) is negative and significant, while those of the West (.26) and Asia (.41) are positive and significant.</p><p>Shared Meaning. Logo design characteristics explained about the same amount of variance for all three clusters (19% for Asia, 22% for the West, and 23% for Russia). Naturalness increases shared meaning, while elaborateness reduces shared meaning in all three clusters.</p><p>Harmony and the objective design elements do not influence shared meaning.</p><p>True Recognition. Logo design dimensions and objective elements explain 10% of true recognition for Asia, 6% for Russia, and 3% for the West. Naturalness has a positive influence and is equivalent across the clusters (Asia .10, the West .07, and Russia .06 ). Harmony, parallelism, and repetition have nonsignificant effects on true recognition in all three clusters.</p><p>Two cluster differences emerge in the relationships between elaborateness, proportion, and true recognition. Elaborateness has a positive influence in Asia but no influence in Russia or the West (Asia .07 vs Russia -.02 vs West -.04), although this difference is not statistically significant across clusters. The effect of proportion is not statistically different across clusters but has a negative influence in Russia (-0.17) and is insignificant in Asia (0.04) or the West (-.01).</p><p>False Recognition. Logo design characteristics explain a small percentage of false recognition for Asia (6%) and the West (7%) but a larger percentage in Russia (23%). For all clusters, naturalness decreases false recognition, while elaborateness and harmony increase false recognition.</p><p>Summary. Overall, the results for the cross-national clusters were consistent with prior work <ref type="bibr">(Henderson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Cote, 1998, Henderson, Cote, Leong and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Schmitt, 2003)</ref>. This is especially true for naturalness and harmony where the patterns of the path estimates are consistent across response variables and clusters. Natural designs universally increase positive affect, shared meaning, subjective familiarity, and true recognition, and decrease false recognition. Designs high in harmony universally increase positive affect, subjective familiarity, and false recognition, while not affecting shared meaning or true recognition. However, the effect of harmony on subjective familiarity was higher for the West than for Asia.</p><p>The largest cluster differences were for elaborate designs. In most cases, elaborate designs increased positive affect, subjective familiarity, and true and false recognition, while decreasing shared meaning. However, the Russian cluster differed significantly from the other clusters,</p><p>where the influence of elaborate designs on affect was much smaller and that on subjective familiarity was actually negative. Arrindell et al. ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>) offer a possible explanation for this result. They find that countries with low uncertainty avoidance scores have greater tolerance for uncertainty and complexity. Since consumers in the Asian and, to a lesser extent, Western clusters have lower uncertainty avoidance scores, they may like and feel more familiar with complex designs than their Russian counterparts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The goals of our study were to: 1) extend finite-mixture, structural-equation models to account for individual judgment in stimulus-level design responses, 2) assess the cross-cultural universality of design dimensions and the stability of responses to these dimensions, and 3) address managerial concerns about adapting logos for global markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Extending Finite-Mixture Structural-Equation Models</head><p>The proposed constrained finite-mixture, structural-equation modeling approach using concomitant variables proved a valuable tool for identifying latent logo clusters that are evaluated similarly across countries. Our approach does not assume that logo evaluations within countries belong to the same cluster a priori (although our findings resulted in country-based clusters). Due to our concomitant variable formulation, the identified cross-national clusters are easily interpreted. Further, previous experimental research in aesthetics aggregates individual responses for each logo. In contrast, our approach addresses a potential aggregation bias by modeling response heterogeneity through a hierarchical structure. More generally, our constrained finite-mixture, structural-equation modeling procedure can be extended to analyze datasets with many subgroups, aggregating them into larger classes based on response similarity.</p><p>For example, our procedure can answer such questions as: how would different stakeholders (stockholders, consumers, competitors, public policy makers) respond to different multidimensional stimuli such as a company's pricing practices; or how would different industries or markets react to different types of research and design projects. In addition, the proposed approach is suitable for smaller sample sizes, allows the incorporation of available prior parameter information, and avoids obtaining negative variances or Heywood cases.</p><p>The constrained finite-mixture modeling procedure can also provide important logo optimization guidelines. For instance, the Western cluster seems to have difficulty recognizing logo 65 , as indicated by an average true recognition score of .57 (on a 0-1 scale), compared to .64 in Asia and .73 in Russia. In addition, this logo has a moderate affect score across cultures (average score 3.9 on a 7-point scale). The low naturalness score (2.3) is probably why this logo performs poorly, since naturalness has a positive influence on both true recognition and affect.</p><p>Using posterior draws of the parameters, a designer can determine the minimum required naturalness score for a given country, such that its expected affect and true recognition values are higher than a predetermined threshold. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">7</ref> For instance, the score of naturalness should be at least 3.5 in Russia, 3.9 in China, and 5.7 in the U.K. to obtain true recognition and affect scores of at least .65 and 4.0 respectively. Similarly, the elaborateness score of logo 65 in Germany should be between 3.2 and 4.2 (current median score equals 3.0) to reach an expected score of at least 4.0 on affect and .15 on shared meaning (current median scores are 3.9 and .33, respectively).</p><p>Such optimization is especially important for elaborateness since its effects are not positive on all responses for all clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Design Dimension Universality and Stability of Consumer Responses</head><p>Previous research suggests that elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony are design dimensions that exist across stimuli. Even when the design elements are quite different, these three dimensions appear repeatedly. Our results show that these design dimensions also exist across cultures, suggesting that they may be universal. The existence of universal design dimensions has important implications for design research. Currently, when developing a design study, researchers must select which of innumerable elements should be used to describe the design.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Orth and Malkewitz (2008)</ref> included 62 design elements for wine labels and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Henderson, Giese, and Cote (2004)</ref> used 24 elements for typeface. Focusing on a reduced set of design dimensions should make design research more tractable.</p><p>Our results also support the contention of evolutionary psychology that design perceptions are innate and relatively immune from cultural influence. Not only do different cultures perceive design similarly, but they also appear to respond similarly as well. Of course, culture does have some influence. For example, our results suggest that higher uncertainty avoidance cultures may find elaborate designs less attractive than lower uncertainty avoidance ones. research might also study more countries and extend the concomitant variable approach to allow cluster proportions to vary along more dimensions (e.g., writing systems and uncertainty avoidance) than only country evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Managerial Guidelines for Adapting Global Logos</head><p>For the manager interested in maintaining a consistent brand image worldwide, our results</p><p>suggest a standardized core logo can work globally. Logo perceptions and responses are similar enough across cultures that a given logo design will produce similar effects in many parts of the world. In addition, when evaluating logo designs, managers may want to focus on affective responses where design dimensions and elements appear to have the strongest influence. Design appears less related to recognition and shared meaning, which are learned responses strongly influenced by other marketing investments.</p><p>This implies that managers should particularly focus on designing elaborate, natural, and harmonious logos that elicit positive affect because it may be difficult to rectify design problems by other marketing efforts. For example, Habitat for Humanity recently created a new logo .</p><p>It is more natural and elaborate, but it may be slightly less harmonious than the previous logo . We predict that this new logo will increase positive affect and, to a lesser extent, shared meaning worldwide. Increasing harmony such as might have been even more effective.</p><p>Although these guidelines seem intuitive, managers continue to create poor logos <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Colman et al., 1995)</ref> as the 2012 London Olympics Logo (which cost ₤400,000 to create) so vividly illustrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Methven and McGurran, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Elaborating on the suggestions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kohli, Suri, and Thakor (2002)</ref>, we suggest managers do the following when designing or modifying a logo:</p><p>1. Choose the core logo image carefully and specify clear response objectives for various regions. 2. Communicate with logo designers using the design dimensions of elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony. Our results suggest they provide a parsimonious vocabulary for design communication. 3. Design something effective before entering new markets. You often cannot change your brand name, but you can change your logo. 4. Don't go with the flavor-of-the-month or "artistically interesting" logos. Stick to logos that simply and richly capture the essence of something (elaborateness); depict commonly experienced objects (naturalness); and represent congruent patterns or arrangements of parts (harmony). 5. Be systematic and objective and allow designers to modify the core logo for individual markets. However, use the results of Table <ref type="table">4</ref> to guide logo selection rather than to rely solely on the opinion of a particular logo designer or committee. 6. Test new alternatives against existing logos since there are multiple ways to create elaborate, natural, and harmonious logos.</p><p>As a company builds brand familiarity within a country, consumer responses to its logo may depend less on the actual design and more on the associations formed with the brand. However, there are several cases where our recommended guidelines will be important regardless of brand name and reputation. These include:</p><p>1. New companies. When you first create a logo and brand, they have no meaning.</p><p>2. New consumers. New international markets will interpret a logo design before the brand's verbal information. 3. Changing logos. A product may have a place in the mind, but a new logo triggers new thinking about the brand (which may be inconsistent with the original positioning). If a logo is not properly designed, it can interfere with the processing of brand information and interpretation of the new image. 4. Mergers or brand extensions. Acquiring new companies may necessitate modifying a logo to better capture the full range of company products. 5. Marketing to children or the illiterate. Children and the illiterate will learn by visuals before any processing of verbal information.</p><p>Lastly, for managers less concerned about having a single global logo, it may be possible to optimize a logo for specific countries or regions, as shown in the previous discussion of logo optimization. Since country differences are mostly in degree not direction, adding or deleting a design element or dimension should elicit better responses across cultures. If Habitat wanted to optimize their logo for Russia, it could be made less complex by removing the repetitive elements as in . Tide did something similar with its logo (left below). When the logo was used for packaging in China (right), it was much more elaborate and natural than in the U.S.</p><p>(middle). Additional color and visual elements, plus arms added to the traditional circular logo make the image more active and representative-like a cyclone.</p><p>There are at least three caveats associated with our recommended approach to logo design in international markets. First, because our research was done in only 10 of 195 possible countries, managers need to be cautious about generalizing results beyond the 10 studied markets. If a manager needs to modify a design for markets not included in our study, we recommend that managers obtain the cultural characteristics of the country from a web site such as <ref type="url" target="http://www.geert-hofstede.com/">http://www.geert-hofstede.com/</ref> and match the new market to the cultural characteristics of the markets described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. Then select the most similar country and apply the optimization procedure discussed in Section 6.2 to obtain dimensional estimates of the optimal logo design.</p><p>Second, student subjects were used to test consumer responses to consumer logos. Hence, the observed relationships between logo characteristics and responses may have a different direction and strength in other groups. Our respondent homogeneity may underestimate the cultural effects of logo design characteristics. Third, our recommendations may not apply to brand/logo combinations. Future research could assess consumer familiarity with brands; expose them to different brand/logo combinations; and measure affect, subjective familiarity, shared meaning, and recognition.</p><p>In a limited experiment with U.S. student subjects, the logo used for the 2012 London Olympics application campaign generated a more positive attitude toward the Olympics brand than when using the final official logo (see Web Appendix D). The alternative logo was rated as more natural, harmonious, and elaborate than the one selected. This result suggests that logos can have an effect even on an established brand. We are thus optimistic that future brand/logo research will replicate our findings. 3.

The first factor was between subjects the second factor was within subjects. Participants saw one of two versions of each brand/logo combination displayed in the table below: Korean Air and the 2012 London Olympics. After viewing each logo, subjects rated their affect toward the brand using the same scale we report in the paper. At the end of the experiment, subjects received definitions of elaborateness, harmony, and naturalness and then rated all four logos in these terms.</p><p>The results are interesting and consistent with what is reported in the paper. For the Korean Air condition, students rated the first brand/logo combination (with the geese) as significantly more elaborate, significantly more natural, but just as harmonious as the second brand/logo combination with the circle. Respondents reported more positive affect for the brand after exposure to the first logo/brand combination than to the second combination (p&lt;.09). For the Olympics condition, the ribbon design was rated as more elaborate, natural, and harmonious (all p&lt;.05) than the puzzle design. The difference in affect ratings was even greater, with the ribbon design being strongly preferred (p&lt;.05).

The element 3 N = logo objective design elements (repetition, proportion, and parallelism) are measured at the logo level and are equal across countries. These 6 N = logo design characteristics influence 5 M = response variables (affect, subjective familiarity, shared meaning, and true and false recognition). Affect is assessed by = items measured at the individual level. Subjective familiarity is also measured at the individual level using a single item for each respondent. Shared meaning, true recognition, and false recognition are measured at the logo level and are an aggregate of the individual-level responses as described previously.

Complexity is created by irregularity in the arrangement of elements, increases in the number of elements, heterogeneity in the nature of elements, and ornateness of the design.</p><p>Active designs give the impression of motion or flow.</p><p>Depth gives the appearance of perspective or of being threedimensional.</p><p>Naturalness reflects the degree to which the design depicts commonly experienced objects. It comprises the elements of representativeness and organicity.</p><p>Representativeness is the degree of realism in a design. This occurs when the elements of an object are distilled to its most typical features.</p><p>Organicity refers to natural shapes as opposed to angular and abstract designs.</p><p>Round designs are made of primarily curved lines and circular elements.</p><p>Harmony is a congruent pattern or arrangement of parts that combines the elements of symmetry and balance.</p><p>Symmetric designs appear as reflections along one (or more) axis.</p><p>Balance captures the notion that there is a center of suspension between two weights or portions of the design.</p><p>Parallel designs contain multiple lines or elements that appear adjacent to each other.</p><p>Repetition is the iterative use of design parts that are similar or identical to each other-unless they are simply part of a larger whole (e.g., branches on a tree).</p><p>Proportion is the relationship between the horizontal and vertical dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B</head><p>This Appendix presents the posterior distributions we used to draw the model parameters in the MCMC sampler. Because we chose conjugate prior distributions, 9 the derivations of these posterior distributions are relatively standard. However, for some of the derivations of conditional posteriors, we use the following well-known result in statistics to derive the conditional distribution of the free parameters in a multivariate normal vector in which some parameters are fixed to a prespecified number a.

In the derivations, we refer to this result as the "partitioning result."</p><p>For the Gibbs sampler, we use cycles sequentially through the following conditional posteriors. In the first two steps, we followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Diebolt and Robert, 1994)</ref> to draw the augmented variables ci z and the cluster probabilities π .</p><p>1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Web Appendix C Convergence Diagnostics</head><p>This Appendix presents convergence diagnostics for the parameter estimates of the final model (i.e., three segments, with metric invariance). For each parameter estimate, we compute three statistics suggested by <ref type="bibr">Raftery and Lewis (1992)</ref>: Burn, Total, and, I-stat, and one p-value based on the convergence diagnostic proposed by <ref type="bibr">Geweke (1992)</ref>. Burn indicates the number of draws to use before burn-in. Total represents the total number of draws needed to achieve accuracy draws. We follow <ref type="bibr">Raftery and Lewis (1992)</ref>, such that the estimated .025 and .975 quantiles of the 95% confidence result in an actual posterior interval that lies between .94 and .96. The I-stat is a statistic that is based on the autocorrelation of the posterior draws. <ref type="bibr">Raftery</ref>  We estimate the convergence statistics using CODA software <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Robert and Casella 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Tables C1 to C5 present the convergence diagnostics for each parameter presented in the paper.</p><p>All 144 parameters have a Burn parameter smaller than 15, which means that all parameters converged according to this statistic. This is also confirmed by the p-value of Geweke, which is (for all but three parameters) nonsignificant. In addition, all I-stats are smaller than five, indicating that there are no convergence problems. </p></div>			</div>
