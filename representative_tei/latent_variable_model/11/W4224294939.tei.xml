<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>PRIOR RESEARCH STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIP between music training (MT) and more general cognitive faculties, such as visuospatial working memory (VSWM), often fails to include tests of musical memory. This may result in causal pathways between MT and other such variables being misrepresented, potentially explaining certain ambiguous findings in the literature concerning the relationship between MT and executive functions. Here we address this problem using latent variable modeling and causal modeling to study a triplet of variables related to working memory: MT, musical working memory (MWM), and VSWM. The triplet framing allows for the potential application of d-separation (similar to mediation analysis) and Vstructure search, which is particularly useful since, in the absence of expensive randomized control trials, it can test causal hypotheses using cross-sectional data. We collected data from 148 participants using a battery of MWM and VSWM tasks as well as a MT questionnaire. Our results suggest: 1) VSWM and MT are unrelated, conditional on MWM; and 2) by implication, there is no far transfer between MT and VSWM without near transfer. However, the data are unable to distinguish an unambiguous causal structure. We conclude by discussing the possibility of extending these models to incorporate more complex or cyclic effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T HE LITERATURE REGARDING MUSIC TRAINING</head><p>(MT) and other nonmusical cognitive faculties, like working memory (WM), is somewhat ambiguous, with competing evidence and explanations for the same or similar sets of variables. For instance, several authors have documented a positive correlation between MT and various WM capacities, such as visuospatial working memory (VSWM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Talamini et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Talamini et al., , 2017))</ref>. This positive correlation has been explained via two general arguments that are often assumed to be incompatible or competing with one another.</p><p>On one side, taking approaches related to genetics, it can be argued that prior dispositions, subserved by genotypic variation, are the primary cause for the positive correlation (i.e., those with better nonmusical WM capacities, in the first place, are predisposed towards developing acute musical memory faculties). This preexisting dispositions hypothesis is rooted in the idea that pre-existing dispositions (which could be due to genetics but also other developmental factors, e.g., socioeconomic background) play the fundamental role in simultaneously guiding the acquisition of musical and nonmusical skills, hence explaining the positive correlations between MT and nonmusical cognitive faculties <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Mosing et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mrazik &amp; Dombrowski, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Plomin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Tan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Vinkhuyzen et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, particularly driven by the field of neuroscience, it is suggested that MT not only improves musical memory faculties, but also potentially other related WM faculties, such as VSWM, via experiencedriven plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bergman Nutley et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">George &amp; Coch, 2011)</ref>. This experience-driven hypothesis is rooted in the idea that musical abilities are primarily cultivated through training <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ericsson et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ericsson &amp; Moxley, 2013)</ref>, which, in turn, can have far transfer effects to nonmusical domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bigand &amp; Tillmann, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Patel, 2011)</ref>, perhaps through a profound experience-driven restructuring of the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bangert &amp; Altenmu ¨ller, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mu ¨nte et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Seither-Preisler et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CAUSALITY AND MUSIC TRAINING</head><p>Clearly, the scenarios described above offer alternative causal explanations for the same variables. Since a causal claim bestows a mechanism upon related phenomena, it is a serious affair that should be undertaken with the utmost diligence. Yet, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schellenberg's (2020)</ref> recent literature review demonstrated, when assessing whether MT can have ''far transfer'' effects to nonmusical domains, researchers have repeatedly committed the error of making (or implying) causal inferences based on correlational data. These biases were found to be systematic: A) positive associations between MT and nonmusical constructs tended to interpret MT as the antecedent, and B) such misinterpretive errors occurred more often in the neuroscience literature, which was more likely to interpret the positive associations as a result of experience-driven plasticity and neglect behavioral genetics approaches. In closing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schellenberg (2020)</ref> notes what is at stake by misrepresenting the causal direction: ''it is a disservice [ . . . ] to offer false hope, wittingly or otherwise, to the public, educators, and other researchers' <ref type="bibr">' (p. 479)</ref>. Hence, given the history of misinterpretation, it is especially important to be cautious with correlational data when studying MT and its often supposed ''effects.''</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LONGITUDINAL DESIGN IN MUSIC TRAINING RESEARCH</head><p>In an appropriately designed study, longitudinal research is one way to mitigate the limitations of cross-sectional data, since ascertaining the temporal precedence of certain factors through repeated measurements offers a strong argument for causal inference. The few existing longitudinal studies relevant to our inquiry have found that long-term MT could have positive effects on cognitive and sensorimotor functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(James et al., 2020)</ref>, implement functional cortical changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Seither-Preisler et al., 2014)</ref>, generate small general intellectual benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Schellenberg, 2004)</ref>, and positively influence language development <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lorenzo et al., 2014)</ref>. Correspondingly, some authors argue their results illustrate that MT has far transfer effects whereby acquired musical skills transfer to general and unrelated domains (e.g., numeracy, academic achievement; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hille &amp; Schupp, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Williams et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, some of the methodological designs still suffer from a neglect of inherited/pre-existing dispositions approaches, and hence, other longitudinal research has urged more cautious conclusions. For example, MT may not independently contribute to improved academic achievement once certain variables (like IQ and academic performance pre-training) are adjusted for <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yang et al., 2014)</ref>. Clearly, more longitudinal research is needed to establish a consensus on whether MT can indeed have far transfer effects. However, it will likely take many more years to achieve this based on sufficiently powered longitudinal studies. In the meantime, we attempted to find a way to study MT with cross-sectional data without committing the errors Schellenberg (2020) warned against.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE MISSING LINK?</head><p>We suggest that one reason for the ambiguous findings described above may be that many studies that assess MT and nonmusical variables do not include tests of musical memory in their design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bailey &amp; Penhune, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Diaz Abrahan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Schellenberg, 2004)</ref>. Consequently, when assessing MT alongside a nonmusical variable, one is either assessing a bivariate relationship or not considering musical memory in the variable set. Yet, it seems likely that musical memory faculties are highly relevant variables, and if involved in the measured variable set, could result in different inferences being made. Hence, we decided to design a study that can account for a role of musical memory and, consequently, allow for an intermediary effect to be discovered. Focusing on one such relevant variable that seems to be a likely intermediate between MT and general WM, we characterize musical working memory (MWM) as a domain-specific working memory faculty that supports the temporary retention and manipulation of musical stimuli (e.g., musical notation) in order to perform musical tasks (e.g., sight-reading; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Berz, 1995)</ref>. Those who have undergone intense music training, often referred to as ''musicians,'' should have larger MWM (and potentially other WM) capacities than those with less training <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Okada &amp; Slevc, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Talamini et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Alongside MWM and MT, we also focus on VSWM as a representative aspect of nonmusical WM. VSWM, also known as the visuospatial sketchpad, is a component of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baddeley's (2000)</ref> multicomponent model of WM, arguably the most widely accepted WM framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Conway et al., 2013)</ref>. We focus on VSWM because it is clearly distinct from the auditory components of MWM, while simultaneously being a strong predictor of performance in important life domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anaya et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Li &amp; Geary, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pham &amp; Hasson, 2014)</ref>. It sometimes also positively correlates with MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Talamini et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>By framing the problem as a triplet of variables, our approach invites the use of informative, and also relatively novel, methodologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CORRELATION ¼ CAUSATION? CAUSAL INFERENCE IN STATISTICS</head><p>As Schellenberg (2020) noted, researchers need to be very careful about making causal misinterpretations, which seem particularly endemic to studies of MT. Yet, fortunately, it is not strictly true that correlations can never imply causation. Recent developments in statistical theory and practice have carefully documented the conditions under which causality may be inferred from cross-sectional data (i.e., via correlations). The causal inferences in statistics field has grown substantially over recent years due to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pearl (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Spirtes et al. (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Morgan (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Imbens and Rubin (2015)</ref> and many others. Pearl has repeatedly argued that ''the mantra correlation does not imply causation should give way to some correlations do imply causation'' <ref type="bibr">(Pearl &amp; Mackenzie, 2018, p. 75)</ref>, because causal models generate testable implications that can be evaluated statistically. This provides a direct answer to the question in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schellenberg's (2020)</ref> title, ''Correlation ¼ Causation?'' Yes, if (and only if) models are based on defendable causal assumptions, and the axioms of causal analysis are stringently followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Pearl, 2000)</ref>, it is possible to investigate causal hypotheses with cross-sectional data. Hence, using data-driven modeling to ''let the data speak,'' as well as employing theoretical scrutiny, is one way of mitigating bringing a priori human biases into the model selection process. This approach also allows a wider set of models to be considered simultaneously, without ruling important ones out in advance. Hence, this enables new overlooked hypotheses to be considered and may offer a solution to the ambiguity documented above. Consequently, this is the key purpose of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A NOVEL APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS OVERLOOKED, ALTERNATE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HYPOTHESES</head><p>Under a bivariate problem framing that pits the ''nature vs. nurture'' inherited characteristics vs. experiencedriven worldviews against each other, we would only investigate two hypotheses: VSWM ¼&gt; MT vs. MT ¼&gt; VSWM. However, in our triplet framing, the problem would now be more nuanced, involving an interim effect (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In traditional psychological research vocabulary, this is known as mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>; in causal modeling vocabulary, discussed shortly, it is known as d-separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hayduk et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>However, even as a triplet framing, to pit these two hypotheses against each other is still limiting and betrays a priori assumptions that there are only two worthy hypotheses to test. This would represent a less futile, but similar, error to that which Schellenberg (2020) warned against, since contemporary behavioral genetics research tells a story of nature and nurture, rather than nature vs. nurture <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Plomin, 2018)</ref>. As there is no necessary logical contradiction between the inherited characteristics and experience-driven hypotheses: both causal explanations could logically hold, and instead, it would be a matter of determining their degree of relevance. In other words, a priori, it is logically plausible that concurrently A) nonmusical WM faculties, such as VSWM, support MWM, and B) MT is a factor that causally improves MWM faculties. Similar to mediation, a consequence of such a hypothesis is that the variables VSWM and MT need not be directly related to each other but can be related only via their relationship with MWM. We could call such a hypothesis, the ''independent causes hypothesis'' (model 3), which outlines the fact that MT and VSWM are only related, conditional on MWM, and both independently influence it (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). However, note that, empirically, such a hypothesis is questioned by the documentation of positive correlations between WM and MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Talamini et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Talamini et al., , 2017))</ref>, which should not be found under this causal structure. Nonetheless, model 3 represents one example of many such possible alternate models of the way MT, VSWM and MWM could interact. We spell these models out in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. and discuss some other alternatives later.</p><p>Model 3 and other similar models are of particular interest because of their ''V'' pattern. Fortunately, the pattern of correlational relationships that would underly this hypothesis, known in the causal modeling literature as a V-structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Elwert, 2013)</ref>, is one of the only mathematically proven correlational dependencies that can imply a causation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, if found in real data, it would suggest that there is no contradiction between the experience-driven and prior dispositions hypotheses. The next section of this paper presents the mentioned concepts of d-separation and Vstructures in more detail to help the unfamiliar reader understand the causal modeling framework, and hence, the design of our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A MINI CAUSAL MODELING PRIMER FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESEARCH</head><p>Like structural equation modeling (SEM), Pearl's causal modeling theory <ref type="bibr">(2000,</ref><ref type="bibr">2009)</ref> employs graph theory to represent causal relationships visually but expands on traditional SEM terminology and concepts. In causal modeling theory, and graph theory more generally, a graph that hypothesizes causal relationships between variables and contains no feedback loop between them is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Shrier &amp; Platt, 2008</ref>, for a biomedical application). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the possible a priori hypotheses represented as DAGs. Next, our analysis requires briefly outlining two concepts that are potentially less well known to the general psychological community: d-separation and collider/V-structures (for an extended but still very accessible introduction see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Elwert, 2013)</ref>. D-separation is effectively equivalent to partial correlation, asking whether two variables (X and Y) become statistically independent given another variable or set of variables (Z). If X and Y become unrelated given Z, they are said to be d-separated. As suggested by the term dseparation, which stands for directional-separation, this has a causal implication: if the relationship of X and Y can be accounted for by Z, then there is no direct causal effect of X on Y, allowing any direct causal path between X and Y to be removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hayduk et al., 2003)</ref>. Under this circumstance, Z is said to fully mediate the effect of X and Y and this is effectively equivalent to the traditional psychological methodological notion of mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>The second causal tool we employ is a search for V-structures (or ''colliders''). Pearl (2017) calls V-structures a ''gift from God'' because they imply causality. A V-structure occurs when two uncorrelated variables become correlated after adjusting for a third variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pearl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tian &amp; Pearl, 2013)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> visually displays the pattern of bivariate and partial correlations required to produce a V-structure: A) the bivariate correlations suggest X and Z are not significantly related, but X and Y are significantly related, and Y and Z are significantly related; B) the partial correlations find X and Z to be related conditional on Y. The pattern of bivariate and partial correlations in A and B respectively imply that X and Z cause Y but are unrelated with each other.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> It is worth emphasizing that it is only the emergence of this special class of dependencies that would identify a unique causal solution. In other   words, other non-V-structure causal scenarios such as models 1 and 2 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) cannot be detected by this method.</p><p>To understand why this is so, consider an intuitive and musical example that helps to grasp the logic of a V-structure. Two factors that often account for enrollment in a school for gifted children are either A) musical talent or B) sports talent. In the general population, musical talent and sports talent are unrelated. However, within the school, musical talent and sports talent would be negatively correlated. In other words, if you know a person is a good hockey player and enrolled at the school, you can be fairly sure that her musical talent will be comparatively low! Hence, musical talent and sports talent become related conditional on enrollment status and one ''explains away'' the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Pearl &amp; Mackenzie, 2018)</ref>. Assuming there are no confounding variables, finding empirically that musical talent and sports talent become related conditional on enrollment in a gifted school would respectively imply that sports talent and musical talent cause school enrollment and rule out other possible causal trajectories between the three variables: other causal patterns would give rise to another set of correlational dependencies.</p><p>In summary, in an empirical dataset, from the pattern of partial correlations, d-separation can tell us which two variables are directly related to each other after taking the influence of other variables into account. Additionally, from the pattern of bivariate and partial correlations we might be able to identify V-structures in triples of variables that would allow us to assign directional paths to the relationships between variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGICAL BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS TO THE CAUSAL MODELING APPROACH</head><p>It is worth briefly considering some benefits of the causal modeling approach as well as its limitations. First, as mentioned, an issue with the approach that considers only models 1 vs. 2 is that it a priori rules out many other possible candidates and hence implies a strong assumption with a comparatively weak foundation. The ability to investigate other causal models, such as model 3 discussed earlier, was a key motivation for this research. But not only does the causal modeling approach allow us to consider this single overlooked hypothesis, it widens the hypothesis space of our question from the 2 directional hypotheses assumed in previous approaches to twelve by not ruling out any other models a priori. This gives all the same ability to be discovered in real data (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). For instance, there are two other V-structures that are possible under our problem framing, only these seem marginally less likely. However, simply because we consider them less likely, our approach does not rule them out in the first place. Hence, due to the consequence of this method widening the hypothesis space and becoming more data-driven in nature, it may offer a novel solution to the ambiguous causal problem. Furthermore, while all the models enumerated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> could be tested against each other using measures of global model fit (i.e., structural equation modeling), constraint-based causal modeling rules out many candidates beforehand which safeguards against assessing the fit of models that are causally implausible.</p><p>Second, since MT is regarded as the formal pursuit of acquiring musical skills, which is often intense and undertaken over longer time periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lehmann et al., 2007)</ref>, potential transfer effects are generally thought to take place over months or years <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hyde et al., 2009)</ref>. Consequently, employing experimental or quasiexperimental methods or even randomized control trials (the ''gold standard'' of making causal claims; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jones &amp; Podolsky, 2015)</ref> to establish causal relationships between MT and other abilities becomes complex and expensive and such research is relatively scarce. Hence, in lieu of more longitudinal research, replicated in multiple settings, causal modeling would provide some tentative suggestions and potentially allow us to diagnose methodological issues (e.g., overlooking hypotheses a priori) before collecting data longitudinally.</p><p>A key limitation with the approach is the fact that, as Pearl points out, ''data [alone] are profoundly dumb'' <ref type="bibr">(Pearl &amp; Mackenzie, 2018, p. 6)</ref>. Hence, data need to be supplemented by causal assumptions derived from substantial theory available in a research domain. Consequently, the data-driven approach is no panacea, and it is important to subject any statistically plausible models to theoretical scrutiny to avoid being theoryblind. Furthermore, the models that result from causal analysis should eventually be confirmed by longitudinal studies; though as noted, causal analysis may allow issues to be identified, as well as novel plausible hypotheses to be generated, in advance of longitudinal data collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE PRESENT STUDY</head><p>The main purpose of this study is to reinvestigate the plausibility of previously overlooked hypotheses regarding the relationship between MT and nonmusical variables, such as VSWM, reframed as a triplet of variables that includes tests of musical memory. We hence seek to rule out ways the variables MT, VSWM, and MWM could interact and narrow down our wide a priori model set. In the best case scenario of finding a V-structure, we may be able to reason for a unique causal solution that may help solve the ambiguities discussed.</p><p>To attempt to identify the most plausible causal relationships between VSWM, MWM, and MT, we used a latent variable approach. For similar approaches see <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Visser et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Okada and Slevc (2018)</ref>. The use of causal discovery tools to identify the possible causal directions between latent variables from cross-sectional data, and to discard causal relationships that do not have empirical support from the data, is still fairly novel in the analysis of behavioral psychological data. For initial work in this area see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Moffa et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McNally (2016)</ref>.</p><p>In our approach, first, we seek to validate a measurement model consisting of two sets of manifest variables thought to measure the latent variables VSWM and MWM; as well as a single measured variable to represent the latent variable MT. Then, using causal modeling, we attempt to identify a single causal model which explains the relationships between these variables based on the pattern of bivariate and partial correlations in our cross-sectional dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HYPOTHESES</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we outline all the possible DAGs as hypotheses where each of the factors is related to at least one other factor in a directional manner. There are 12 such possible directed acyclic models which could explain the causal relationships between VSWM, MWM, and MT. Since the literature already suggests that MWM, VSWM, and MT are significantly related to one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anaya et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sua ´rez et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Talamini et al., 2016)</ref>, we intend to go further and obtain a more precise causal explanation of the relationships. Hence, model B1 represents a hard null model, with no relationships between the factors at all, and model B2 represents a soft null model where the factors are all related as previously observed, but nondirectionally. All other models represent alternative hypotheses which are not ruled out a priori.</p><p>Models 1, 2, and 3 (the prior dispositions, the experience driven, and the independent causes hypotheses, respectively) have already been discussed. For the sake of brevity, we cannot discuss all the theoretical positions corresponding to the other nine models. Consequently, other than the three positions discussed, we limit ourselves to discussing one more model, model 4, and its related models, which we deemed implausible a priori.</p><p>Any model, such as model 4, which holds that MWM precedes VSWM causally seems unlikely. In terms of cognitive evolution, it is implausible that a specialized system would precede or support a more general one <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Overmann et al., 2013)</ref>, i.e., that individuals develop a specialized psychological system (e.g., MWM for handling musical symbols) which precedes the development of a general system (e.g., VSWM for generally handling visual information). Moreover, while some evolutionary psychologists argue for the importance of musical development in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brown, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tarr et al., 2014)</ref>, there is no compelling reason to suggest that musical abilities were more important to survival and reproduction than basic faculties such as VSWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Overmann et al., 2013)</ref>. Hence, these models, and some others, seem implausible, but we nonetheless allow them to be subjected to statistical scrutiny, with the condition that we discuss any remaining model's meaning and theoretical plausibility.</p><p>Other than model 3, note that, since they are Vstructures, models 5 and 10 could also offer a unique causal solution that is detectable by our method, only we deem them to be less theoretically plausible. Furthermore, models that are unidirectional (e.g., models 1, 2, 6, etc.) cannot be individually detected by causal modeling since they do not comprise a V-structure. Hence, to argue for a unique causal solution, one of models 3, 5 or 10 must hold true. Otherwise, there will be a narrowed down set of models, leaving causal ambiguity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>To measure the three latent variables, we tested participants on a battery of tasks and hypothesized how these would load onto the three factors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PARTICIPANTS</head><p>We recruited 148 participants aged 18-50 (to avoid strong effects of cognitive decline of older participants; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Salthouse, 2009)</ref>, and heterogenous on MT, through social media and on-campus advertising at Goldsmiths' College, London, United Kingdom, and Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, to complete the task battery described below. The resulting sample had a mean age of 26.4 (SD ¼ 7.7) and consisted of 88 females and 56 males (the age and gender of four participants was missing for unknown reasons). Eleven participants received course credits in exchange for their participation. All other participants received a small monetary compensation. Recruitment was predominantly from among the Goldsmiths and Macquarie student communities but there was also a proportion of participants recruited from off-campus. The study was granted ethical consent by both Goldsmiths' and Macquarie University ethical approval bodies and participants were free to opt out at any time.

It is primarily concerned with transient and short-term phenomena as well as projection across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fuster, 1997)</ref>. In this sense, WM is usually described as a more dynamical construct (Simmering &amp; Perone, 2013), which is dissociable from the otherwise static-natured construct of intelligence (Alloway &amp; Alloway, 2010). It is even argued to be the limited-capacity system that underlies and constrains intelligence, and hence has been referred to as an ultimate cognitive primitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alloway &amp; Alloway, 2013)</ref>. Since the following six tests (or ''tasks'' as they are often known as in the WM literature), all reflect the dynamical and transient storage and manipulation of stimuli, we operationalize them as measuring WM.</p><p>All of our tasks yield item response theory (IRT) scores, which are the main output of modern test theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Embretson &amp; Reise, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>

Participants must hold multiple spatial locations on a hexagon in WM while answering an unrelated question for each location point shown. Two characters, Jack and Jill, are presented, both holding a ball in one of their hands. For each image, participants have to: 1) decide whether Jack holds the ball in the same hand as Jill, and 2) remember the position of Jack's ball on the hexagon of dots. At the end of each sequence, participants must indicate the position of the balls in the correct order. The task had 14 trials with the length of sequences increasing and hence becoming more difficult. IRT scores for the JaJ task were generated online using the R package psychTestR v2.13.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Harrison, 2020)</ref> according to an underlying explanatory IRT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Silas et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory Updating Figural (MUF)</head><p>The MUF task is a VSWM task similar to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Salthouse et al. (1991)</ref> task and is, more specifically, a reimplementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vock and Holling's (2008)</ref> VSWM task. Participants were presented a variable number of rectangles where dots could appear in any corner for 1.5 seconds at a time, followed by arrows pointing to other corners of the same rectangles. Participants had to remember the various dot locations, imagine where the dots would move to based upon the arrows shown and click in the corners of empty rectangles indicating the final position of each dot. The task comprised 14 items increasing in difficulty based on the number of mental operations to be completed. We could not use previous IRT models for this task because they were constructed using a different task battery and a sample of children, and therefore would likely not produce realistic scores in the context of our analysis. Consequently, we computed post hoc IRT scores for each participant based on sum scores and using the Rasch psychometric model. A Pearson's product-moment correlation of the sum scores with the IRT scores yielded a strong correlation (r ¼ .98, p &lt; .01), indicating a high level of consistency between the classical test theory and IRT scoring methods.</p><p>Backwards Digit Span (BDS) BDS tasks represent a classic measure of WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Case &amp; Globerson, 1974)</ref>.

We reimplemented the version used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vock and Holling (2008)</ref>, which consisted of 12 trials of increasing difficulty using sequences of four to seven digits length. Since all stimuli were presented in the visual domain and responding involved clicking digits on a visually displayed keypad that spatially organized the digits, we consider this a visuospatial BDS task. Previous item response theory (IRT) models for this task could not be used as they were constructed based on their inclusion in another battery of tasks (as explained above). We computed IRT scores for each participant by fitting a Rasch psychometric model to the collected data. A Pearson's product-moment correlation of the sum scores with the IRT scores yielded a very strong correlation (r ¼ .99, p &lt; .01), indicating a high level of consistency between the classical test theory and IRT scoring methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MWM TASKS</head><p>MWM tasks are designed to measure music-specific WM abilities that have been argued to not be sufficiently explained by the widely accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baddeley and Broadbent (1983)</ref> model (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Berz, 1995)</ref>. Since many people do not engage in developing musical expertise (unlike VSWM, which any sighted person, and perhaps nonsighted persons too, must naturally develop), it has been argued that such WM systems represent a different class of WM called long-term working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995)</ref>, which particularly relies on experience-driven and domainspecific training.</p><p>Music-specific ability tests should concern musical, rather than simply auditory, stimuli. Musical features are more sophisticated than auditory, involving a knowledge of syntax and structure (e.g., in the realms of rhythm, harmony, and melody). For example, our Melodic Discrimination Test (MDT) uses pastiche Irish folksong melodies, and so knowledge of the diatonic scale and Western melodic transition probabilities should help memory. In our three MWM tasks, Rhythm Ability Test (RAT), Melodic Discrimination Test (MDT), and Pitch Image Arrow Task (PIAT), the common uniting element is a strong emphasis on transiently remembering and manipulating phenomena which are musical (with melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic qualities).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rhythm Ability Test (RAT)</head><p>The RAT <ref type="bibr">(Mu ¨llensiefen et al., 2019)</ref> measures memory for non-pitched rhythmic stimuli and is related to the musical sequence transcription task described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zuk et al., (2013)</ref>. Each trial plays a rhythmic pattern of high frequency claps and low frequency bass drum kicks. Afterwards, visual representations of four different rhythms are shown with light blue squares representing claps on a top row and dark blue squares representing bass drum kicks on a bottom row. Participants must click the visual representation that corresponds to the rhythmic pattern they heard. The test comprised 16 trials of increasing difficulty as a function of number of rhythmic events, the complexity of the rhythm, and the similarity of the target sequence to the three lures. IRT scores for the RAT task were generated using the R package psychTestRCAT v1.0.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Harrison, 2018)</ref> according to an underlying explanatory IRT model (MacGregor, Mu ¨llensiefen, Fiedler, Andrade, Forth, &amp; Frieler, 2022). The RAT can be considered a WM task because it requires transiently holding information in memory and mentally transforming stimuli from musical to visual modalities.</p></div>

This test uses a 3-AFC response paradigm with each item consisting of three versions of a melody played at different transpositions in pitch (for example: first: D major, second: Eb major, third: E major). Two of these versions are always identical and one is always different. The participant's task is to identify the nonidentical melody, but to ignore transpositions between versions. The version of the MDT used in this study comprised 20 items using an adaptive procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Harrison et al., 2017)</ref>. IRT scores for the MDT task were generated online using the R package psychTestRCAT v1.0.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Harrison, 2018)</ref> according to the underlying IRT model described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Harrison et al.

Participants hear a tonal context comprising of an ascending major scale followed by the tonic of the scale. Starting from the tonic or dominant, a series of notes are played going either up or down one note in the major scale. Arrows that match the direction (up or down) of the change in tonal sequence are presented simultaneously. After a variable number of times, the audio cue ceases, leaving just the presentation of the arrows. The participant must imagine a continued progression along the scale as guided by the arrows, but with no further audible reference. At the end of a trial, a probe tone is played. The participant indicates whether this tone matched the tone they were imagining. A correct response requires identifying the correct place to end up in the scale based on the arrow indications. The task was adaptive. IRT scores for the PIAT task were generated online using the R package psy-chTestRCAT v1.0.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Harrison, 2018)</ref> according to the underlying explanatory IRT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gelding et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>

The MT latent variable was defined using the score yielded from the Gold-MSI's 7item MT subscale as the single manifest indicator of latent MT, together with its measurement error (derived from its internal reliability as estimated in Mu ¨llensiefen et al., 2014). Defining a latent construct by a single indicator has the advantage that the known measurement error can be considered.

MT was measured using the MT subscale of the Gold-MSI self-report inventory. Its measurement error was specified based on the empirical reliability (a ¼ .903) as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mu ¨llensiefen et al. (2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>Our analysis consists of three fundamental steps:</p><p>1. Assess the measurement models of the VSWM and MWM latent variables using exploratory factor analysis and generate factor scores. 2. Assess the pattern of correlations and partial correlations between the MWM, VSWM, and MT factors to: A) apply the rules of d-separation and evaluate whether edges can be removed from a fully connected causal graph, and B) assess whether Vstructures emerge. This process should whittle down the candidate model set (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) to a smaller number of models but hopefully identify a single V-structure model.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIVARIATE CORRELATIONS</head><p>First, we assessed the correlations between all measures (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). All scores correlated significantly (all p values &lt; .05 after correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm's procedure). The correlations between the VSWM tasks were moderate (r ¼ .38 to .53), as were the correlations between the MWM tasks (r ¼ .54 to .58).</p><p>MT showed moderate correlations with the MWM tasks (r ¼ .46 to .57), and small to moderate correlations with the VSWM tasks (r ¼ .23 to .31). The VSWM and MWM tasks had small to moderate correlations with each other (r ¼ .29 to .53).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACTOR ANALYSES</head><p>The hypothesized measurement models for the VSWM and MWM factors were assessed with two independent minimum residual exploratory factor analyses. All factor loadings were &gt; .50 for the VSWM factor and &gt; .70 for the MWM factor, which indicated that the tasks/ items represented the factors well (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The VSWM latent variable explained 47% of the variance in the observed VSWM task scores while the MWM latent variable explained 56% of the variance in the observed MWM task scores. Factor scores were extracted for each participant on each variable.</p><p>We then assessed the pairwise relationships of the extracted VSWM, MWM, and MT factor scores using Pearson's correlation coefficient (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). All factors correlated significantly with each other (all p values &lt; .001 after correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm's procedure). The relationships between MT and MWM (r ¼ .63) and MWM and VSWM (r ¼ .54) were substantial and the relationship between MT and VSWM (r ¼ .36) was moderate. Consequently, on the basis of pairwise correlations alone, null model B1, which posits no correlations between the factors, can be rejected. 2  As outlined above, the comparison of correlations and partial correlations allows us to manually assess d-separation and V-structures. The pattern of correlations and partial correlations between the VSWM, MWM, and MT factors reveals that, while all three factors are significantly related as bivariate  2 Despite the cross-correlations between VSWM and MWM after extraction via our method of two independent factor analyses, submitting all six variables to the same parallel and factor analyses nonetheless suggested two factors. Under this alternative analysis, the hypothesized measures loaded on to the hypothesized factors and no substantial cross-loadings emerged (absolute values ranging .05 to .26 cross loading onto the other factor).</p><p>correlations, conditional on MWM, MT, and VSWM become unrelated; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> (whether correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm's, procedure or not). According to the rules of d-separation, this suggests that there is no direct effect of MT on VSWM or vice versa. Consequently, in a directed acyclic graph that shows all three factors as related by edges connecting them, the edge connecting MT and VSWM can be removed. This creates a scenario whereby MWM mediates the relationship between VSWM and MT. This process of d-separation allows us to reject nine models from Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> as well as the null models. However, the pattern of dependencies for a V-structure described earlier-that two uncorrelated variables become correlated after adjusting for a third variable-does not occur here. Hence, model 3 (and other models) is precluded based on the empirical implications. As a result of the pattern of dependencies, only models 1, 2, 4 remain plausible. All other models imply different dependencies to the observed pattern of bivariate and partial correlations.</p><p>Consequently, since no V-structures emerge, no unique directed causal relationships among the variables are suggested by the pattern of bivariate and partial correlations. The PC-algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Spirtes et al., 2000)</ref> implements the rules of d-separation and a search for V-structures, allowing for a computational search for causal relationships from correlational data. A fully automated analysis using the R package PCalg <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kalisch et al., 2012)</ref>, which implements the PC-algorithm, confirmed that only models 1, 2, and 4 are supported by the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING</head><p>Three independent SEMs representing models 1, 2, and 4 were fit to the data of the full sample (N ¼ 148) using the function sem from the R package lavaan v0.6.9 and the robust full-information maximum likelihood method <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> for an overview of the results. For all models, two commonly used indices indicated a satisfactory model fit in absolute terms (SRMR ¼ .05, CFI ¼ .95; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kline, 2012)</ref>. However, two other commonly used absolute fit indices suggested a less than ideal, but still acceptable, model fit: RMSEA ¼ .10, TLI ¼ .92; 2 (13) ¼ 29.39, p &lt; .01. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as an indicator of relative model fit and the results of a chi-squared test both suggested that models 1 and 2 fit the data significantly better than the null B1 model of no correlations between the factors, ÁBIC ¼ 108.8; 2 (15) ¼ 147.98, p &lt; .001. However, the null B2 model of full bivariate correlations between all three factors had a BIC value that was only slightly worse than the BIC of models 1 and 2 (ÁBIC ¼ 1.8). The chi-squared test comparing model fits also suggested a near-equivalent fit of the null B2 model by narrowly missing significance on a likelihood ratio test of difference in model fit, 2 (12) ¼ 26.32, p ¼ .06. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows models 1, 2, and 4 on the VSWM, MWM, and MT latent variables with standardized factor loadings (single-headed arrows) pointing from the latent variables to each other and parameter estimates representing the magnitude of association (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> for the empirical measurement model loadings). However, since models 1, 2, and 4 have model equivalence <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Williams, 2012)</ref> with each other, they have indistinguishable statistical implications in an SEM framework. Therefore, model testing cannot tell us which of the three remaining models is more plausible as they produce the same parameter estimates and model fits despite being defined with opposing causal directions. However, good models of global fit via SEM adds validity to the results of causal modeling since it suggests the models do not contradict the observed data and are hence plausible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study sought to explain the relationships between MT and various WM constructs. We suggested that the noninclusion of musical memory tests in previous similar studies was an important limitation that we argued may produce a more ambiguous view of such relationships. To rectify this, we specifically sought to empirically characterize MWM and VSWM faculties through latent variable modeling and then assess how these factors are related to MT. By framing the problem as a triplet of variables, we opened the possibility of discovering both mediation (alternatively known as d-separation) and Vstructures, the latter of which would suggest an unambiguous causal solution to question. We also noted that there was no necessary logical contradiction between inherited characteristics and experience-driven approaches and that were several other plausible causal models that could explain the relationships between MT, MWM, and VSWM. Previously, such models may have been overlooked (e.g., by a nature vs. nurture worldview). Consequently, our approach challenged having strong a priori causal assumptions and tried to avoid the misinterpetive biases often seen when studying MT and nonmusical cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Schellenberg, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schellenberg (2020)</ref> noted, these biases often involve incorrectly inferring causality from crosssectional data. However, we showed that it is possible to legitimately infer causality from correlational data under a very strict set of conditions. More broadly, our approach involved the more traditional psychometric approach of latent variable modeling. Consequently, first, we had to assess our measurement model. The factor analyses confirmed the validity of the hypothesized measurement models for the VSWM and MWM constructs as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Considering that the combination of these tasks was novel, this is an achievement which suggests that future research (e.g., longitudinal) could similarly combine the tasks.</p><p>In accordance with findings from the existing literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hambrick et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Talamini et al., 2017)</ref> the VSWM, MWM, and MT latent variables all had significant, positive, and moderate to substantial bivariate relationships with one another. From the a priori space of 12 models that the causal modeling approach opened up (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), the process of d-separation allowed us to narrow our model set down to three statistically plausible causal models. All three remaining models suggest that there is no direct relationship between VSWM and MT but that a domain-specific MWM mediates the relationship. However, there was no V-structure in the pattern of dependencies, meaning that it was not possible to identify a single causal model, as we had hoped for.</p><p>Nonetheless, it can still be considered a substantial insight to narrow down the set of candidate models by discarding nine models, as well as the null models, which were included a priori but not in accordance with the implications of the empirical data. Traditional SEM confirmed the plausibility of our results through acceptable measures of global model fit. However, due the equivalence problem, and the fact that a SEM cannot itself discover causal patterns in data <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Visser et al., 2006)</ref>, we were not able to further decide between the three remaining candidate models in a data-driven manner.</p><p>Of the remaining models, model 4 was flagged as theoretically implausible a priori because it seems unlikely that a specialized system (MWM) logically precedes a related more general system (VSWM). Therefore, we rule this model out on theoretical grounds, and, in sum, our data suggests that models 1 and 2 represent the most likely situation of the models shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. D-separation (similar to mediation) suggested that VSWM and MT were found to be unrelated, conditional on MWM, which suggests that VSWM and MT are not directly related to each other. However, while this does not imply a V-structure pattern, which would require VSWM and MT to be unrelated as a bivariate correlation but become related as a partial correlation (conditional on MWM), it implies that if there are any effects of MT and VSWM on one another, MWM mediates that effect. This represents an important finding because it suggests that there is no far transfer without near transfer: MT and VSWM are only related via MWM, which is known as a mediator effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>. By implication, tests of musical memory should be included when studying the effects of A) MT and WM on one another and B) cognitive abilities and prior dispositions on musical engagement and training. This has important practical significance because many studies that measure the effect of music interventions on cognitive abilities do not include any tests of musical abilities and hence could be missing something important (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bailey &amp; Penhune, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Diaz Abrahan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Schellenberg, 2004)</ref>. This demonstrates how latent variable methods used with cross-sectional data, as employed in this study, can help to inform the design of expensive longitudinal research in advance by flagging such issues. Along the same lines, in principle, from the wider a priori space opened by the causal modeling approach, a surprising but reasonable causal pattern could have been detected in the data. This would have allowed an intervention or longitudinal study to be designed in the appropriate way to capture an effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS</head><p>The possible reasons for our method not to detect a clear causal structure suggest several alternative theoretical explanations as well as some methodological limitations. First, our analyses are conducted at the group level which assumes that effects are systematic/nomothetic. However, perhaps causal trajectories are better explained at the individual/idiographic level (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hommel &amp; Colzato, 2017)</ref> for a discussion of the approaches in psychology).</p><p>Second, the selection of VSWM and MWM, as variables to study with respect to MT, was principled but does not imply that if we had focused on other cognitive constructs, we would have obtained similar results. It is possible that other similar constructs may be sufficient to detect a unique causal effect with respect to MT. Other nonmusical constructs rather than VSWM, for example, could be related to language, mathematical, and sensorimotor abilities as well as social cognition. On this note: operationalizing variables related to WM is particularly challenging. The nature of WM as a cognitive primitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alloway &amp; Alloway, 2013)</ref> suggests that any combination of WM tasks should contain common variance that represents some very general latent aspect of WM, like a central capacity constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cowan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Vergauwe et al., 2010)</ref>. Beyond this, the common variance extracted from a task set should reflect what is otherwise common about the combined tasks. In this vein, we reasoned judiciously what the common variance in each task set (VSWM, MWM) represented. However, this is nonetheless an interpretation.</p><p>Third, the true causal pattern could be unidirectional (e.g., either models 1 or 2) after all. However, causal modeling cannot detect this kind of pattern. Furthermore, this would still raise the question as to why there is evidence for both scenarios. Conversely, fourth, perhaps both causal trajectories described in models 1 and 2 are simultaneously true to some extent. This possibility is suggested by our null B2 model, with bivariate relationships connecting all variables, being very close to model 1 and 2 in terms of absolute model fit. Null model B2 implies that there are cyclic processes at work that cannot be investigated with the methods used here or that unmeasured variables influence both measured variables in a bivariate relationship.</p><p>In general, any unmeasured variables that mediate or moderate the relationships between MT, MWM, and VSWM may obscure our ability to detect effects between them. Socioeconomic status is an example of such a possible confounding variable. However, the broader debate about to what degree socioeconomic status and general life outcomes depend on predispositions goes beyond the scope of the current paper (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Plomin, 2018</ref>, for more on this). Perhaps more difficult is the presence of genetic variants which simultaenously affect two different traits. In studies of MT, a relevant illustration is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mosing et al. (2014)</ref>, who showed through modeling data from a large sample of twins that musical ability and musical practice may be a result of the same genotypic characteristics, an effect known as genetic pleiotropy. This is also a case of ''the nature of nurture'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Plomin, 2018)</ref>, whereby ostensibly environmental variance ends up ultimately being explained by genotypic variance. MT is, in theory and name, an environmental measure. However, it is very likely that a large proportion of its variance could be explained by genotypic factors. In a nongenetically sensitive design like ours, we cannot consider our MT variable as a pure measure of the environment. Hence, we do not really know to what extent our variables, MT, MWM, and VSWM are explained and driven by shared genotypic factors, which may blur any experiencedriven effects. Moreover, we do not know how the relative contributions of nature and nuture interact. For a comprehensive discussion of the above issues, we recommend the reader <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Plomin (2018)</ref> and the empirical literature reviewed there.</p><p>Genetically insensitive designs require assumptions about (or ignorance of) relative genetic and environmental influences. Because such designs cannot disentangle these influences, this may explain why there is significant evidence for supposedly competing causal effects in studies of MT (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Meinz &amp; Hambrick, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ruthsatz et al., 2008)</ref>. In other words, were genetic and environmental influences disentangled, an appropriate modeling strategy could make sense of the way in which the effects interact with each another, rather than assuming the underlying hypotheses compete. We remind the reader of our observation which drove this study, that there is no logical contradiction between models 1 and 2, but that they could mutually coexist in the same causal universe. Since our current modeling approach with cross-sectional data is relatively simplistic, it is only an approximation to the true underlying processes which might be better captured by gene-environment interaction models <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dickens &amp; Flynn, 2001)</ref> or so-called multiplier models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ceci et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dickens, 2007)</ref>. A test of these models will require longitudinal data, but causal modeling results using our current dataset can still be interpreted to suggest the relative strength of the individual components.</p><p>A final methodological limitation to discuss involves latent variable methods, which are limited in psychological research in general. As mentioned, numerous other variables could affect the interactions between the MT, MWM and VSWM variables.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> However, the prime reward of latent variable methods-yielding reduced (lower, minimized) measurement error through measuring the same constructs with multiple measuresalso has the downside of increasing testing time multiplicatively, due to the number of measures required for each factor (it is typically desirable to have more than two indicators per variable, otherwise additional assumptions must be met; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beaujean, 2014)</ref>. Consequently, latent variable approaches quickly bring testing constraints, which means many relevant variables must go unmeasured in psychological research. The axioms of causal modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Pearl, 2009)</ref> vehemently stress how important it is to stringently control for confounding variables to make causal inferences. If one could hold constant for such extraneous variables, it may be possible to achieve a purer picture of the interactions between the variables of interest. But to overcome this with cross-sectional data would require ingenuity, perhaps by combining our method with adaptive testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Harrison &amp; Mu ¨llensiefen, 2018)</ref> and planned missing designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Graham et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AN ULTIMATELY HIERARCHICAL WORKING MEMORY SYSTEM?</head><p>Finally, we consider one final, important interpretation. Based on theory, we assumed VSWM and MWM to be distinct, domain-specific WM constructs. While different subconstructs of WM can be experimentally dissociated in terms of performance on different tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alloway et al., 2006)</ref>, it does not follow that they are entirely distinct constructs. For instance, previous research suggests that a tonal WM network in musicians has structural overlap with a verbal memory network <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schulze et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>All our tasks demonstrated positive manifold, i.e., all positive correlations with one another. This reinvokes the widely replicated observation that there is component variance common to all tests of ability, known as a g-factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Colom et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Spearman, 1904)</ref>. It seems reasonable to posit that there is ultimately one unitary WM (or indeed, cognitive) system that encompasses both VSWM and MWM constructs as components and that such a system is better modelled hierarchically with a single enveloping factor. However, it is beyond the scope of this study to test this.</p><p>The concept of a hierarchical system weakens the notion of transfer effects between ''disparate'' constructs. Instead, it would suggest a more hierarchical phenomenon where, while some abilities are relatively disparate, they are nonetheless ultimately related by very general processes. The presence of a g-factor could be interpreted as supporting inherited characteristics approaches, in that it suggests there is an ultimate general ability that may predispose people towards cognitively demanding activities such as MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Colom et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Spearman, 1904)</ref>. There is a reasonable amount of evidence to suggest that there are central (i.e., nondomain-specific) aspects to WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cowan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Vergauwe et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, it is likely that constructs, as statistically dissociated by psychological tests, capture facets of a unitary WM system that can be delineated in various ways depending on the idiosyncratic combination of tasks employed. Furthermore, it may be that WM itself is not a system (i.e., a set of components and dynamical relationships) as such, but actually a way of processing sequential information in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Christiansen &amp; Chater, 2016)</ref>. This would imply that similar functional properties should be observed in all domains, from music, to chess.</p><p>In general, MT provides an interesting framework in which to research WM because MT particularly requires manipulating multimodal phenomena. Perhaps developing musical expertise encourages WM to create more efficient cross-modal representations, blurring supposedly distinct subsystems. In any case, the strong multimodal nature of MT seems to question the underlying meaning of a multicomponent view of WM. It speaks less to engaging in the statistical dissociation of categorical constructs, which may be somewhat arbitrarily dissociated, and places emphasis back on researching general processes: the ones that help us with all cognitive abilities whether it is driving a car, playing music from notation, or remembering a telephone number. Under this framework, we may better understand and model the complex nature of the cognitive system, where causal pathways do not compete, but interact.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
