<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Latent class analysis is used to classify objects into categories on the basis of multiple observed characteristics. The method is based on a model where the observed variables are treated as measures of a latent variable which has some number of discrete categories or latent classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lazarsfeld &amp; Henry, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Goodman, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haberman, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr">see McCutcheon, 1987</ref> for an overview). This has a wide range of applications in psychology, other social sciences, and elsewhere. For example, latent class analysis was used to identify types of substance abuse among young people by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kam (2011)</ref>, types of music consumers by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chan and Goldthorpe (2007)</ref>, and patterns of workplace bullying by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Einarsen, Hoel, and Notelaers (2009)</ref>.</p><p>In many applications the interest is not just in clustering into the latent classes but in using these classes in further analysis with more complex models. Such extensions include using observed covariates (explanatory variables) to predict latent class membership, and using the latent class as a covariate for other outcomes. For instance, in our illustrative examples we examine how education and birth cohort predict tolerance for nonconformity as classified by latent class analysis, and how latent classes of perceived psychological contract between employer and employee predict the employee's feelings of job insecurity.</p><p>Models like these have two main components: the measurement model for how the latent classes are measured by their observed indicators, and the structural model for the relationships between the latent classes and other explanatory or response variables. Different approaches may be used to fit these models, differing in how the structural and measurement models are estimated and whether they are estimated together or in separate steps. In this article we propose a new "two-step" method of estimating such models, and show that it is an attractive alternative to existing "one-step" and "three-step" methods.</p><p>In the one-step method of estimation both parts of the model are estimated at the same time, to obtain maximum likelihood (ML) estimates for all of their parameters (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Clogg, 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Dayton &amp; Macready, 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Hagenaars, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Bandeen-Roche, Miglioretti, Zeger, &amp; Rathouz, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, and Lanza, Tan, &amp; Bray, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> this is also known as Full <ref type="bibr">Information ML, or FIML, estimation)</ref>. Although this approach is efficient and apparently natural, it also has serious defects (see e.g. the discussions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Croon, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Vermunt, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, and Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2014)</ref>. These arise because the whole model is always re-fitted even when only one part of it is changed. Practically, this can make the estimation computationally demanding, own. In the second and final step, we then maximise the joint likelihood (i.e. the likelihood which is also used in the one-step method), but with the parameters of the measurement model and of exogenous latent variables (if any) fixed at their estimated values from the first step, so that only the parameters of the rest of the structural model are estimated in the second step. This proposal is rooted in the realization that the essential feature of a stepwise approach is that the measurement model is estimated separately, not that there needs to be an explicit classification step. This is especially important because the classification error of the three-step method is introduced in its second step. So by eliminating this step, we eliminate the circular problem of introducing an error that we then need to correct for later on. As a result, the two-step method is more straightforward and easier to understand than the bias-adjusted three-step methods.</p><p>This approach was suggested as a possibility already by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bandeen-Roche et al. (1997</ref><ref type="bibr">, p. 1384)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xue and Bandeen-Roche (2002)</ref> developed it in full, in their case for structural models with the latent class as the response variable, and motivated by applications where the first step was based on a much larger sample than the second. It was also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartolucci, Montanari, and Pandolfi (2014)</ref> for latent Markov models for longitudinal data. We build on and extent these previous proposals, and describe two-step modeling and its properties as a general method for latent class analysis. As already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xue and Bandeen-Roche (2002)</ref>, it can be motivated as an instance of two-stage pseudo ML estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gong &amp; Samaniego, 1981)</ref>. The general theory of such estimation shows that the two-step estimates of the parameters of the structural model are consistent, and it provides asymptotic variance estimates which correctly allow also for the uncertainty in the estimates from the first step.</p><p>Software which can carry out one-step estimation can also be used to implement the two-step method. Our simulations suggest that the two-step estimates are typically only slightly less efficient than the one-step estimates, and a little more efficient than the bias-adjusted three-step estimates.</p><p>Although we focus in this article on latent class models, the conceptual issues and the methods that we describe apply also to other latent variable models (we discuss this briefly further in Section 5). In particular, they are also relevant for structural equation models <ref type="bibr">(SEMs)</ref> where both the latent variables and their indicators are treated as continuous variables (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bollen, 1989)</ref>. There the most commonly used methods are one-step (standard SEMs) and naive three-step estimation (using factor scores as derived variables).</p><p>For some models it is possible to assign factor scores in such a way that the bias of the naive three-step approach is avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Skrondal &amp; Laake, 2001</ref>; comparable methods have been proposed for item response theory models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lu &amp; Thomas, 2008, and</ref> for latent class models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Petersen, Bandeen-Roche, Budtz-Jørgensen, &amp; Groes Larsen, 2012)</ref>, and bias-corrected three-step methods can also be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Croon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Devlieger, Mayer, &amp; Rosseel, 2016)</ref>, but these approaches are less often used in practice. Another stepwise approach for SEMs is two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, different versions of which have been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jöreskog and Sörbom (1986)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lance, Cornwell, and Mulaik (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bollen (1996)</ref>. It uses the ideas of instrumental variable estimation, and is quite different in form to our two-step method. In the closely related context of generalized linear models with continuous covariates measured with error, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Skrondal and Kuha (2012)</ref> proposed a two-step pseudo ML method which is essentially analogous to the one which is described here for latent class models (it uses a slightly different split of parameters between steps one and two).</p><p>The conceptual disadvantages of the one-step method were discussed in the context of SEMs already by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burt (1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Burt ( , 1973))</ref>. He introduced the idea of "interpretational confounding" which arises when the variables that a researcher uses to interpret a latent variable differ from the variables which actually contribute to the estimation of its measurement model. As a way of avoiding such confounding, Burt proposed a stepwise approach which was two-step estimation in the same sense that we describe here. Subsequent literature has, however, made little use of this proposal, even when it has drawn on Burt's ideas otherwise. In particular, stepwise thinking is now much more commonly applied to model selection rather than estimation -in other words, the form of the measurement model is selected separately, but the parameters of this measurement model and any structural models are then estimated together using one-step estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. It is likely that in the large SEM literature there are individual instances of the use of two-step estimation (one example is <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ping, 1996)</ref>, but they are clearly not widespread. There appear to be no systematic theoretical expositions of two-step estimation of the kind that is offered in this article.</p><p>The model setting and the method of two-step estimation are introduced in Section 2 below, followed in Section 3 by a simulation study where we compare it to the existing one-step and three-step approaches. We then illustrate the method in two applied examples in Two-step estimation Section 4, and give concluding remarks in Section 5.</p><p>2. Two-step estimation of latent class models with external variables 2.1. The variables and the models Let X be a latent variable, Y = (Y 1 , . . . , Y K ) observed variables which are treated as measures (indicators) of X, and Z = (Z p , Z o ) observed variables where Z p are covariates (predictors, explanatory variables) for X and Z o is a response variable to X and Z p . We take X and Z o to be univariate for simplicity of presentation, but this can easily be relaxed as discussed later. Here X is a categorical variable with C categories (latent classes) c = 1, . . . , C, and each of the indicators Y k is also categorical, with R k categories for k = 1, . . . , K. Suppose we have a sample of data for n units such as survey respondents, so that the observed data consist of (Z i , Y i ) for i = 1, . . . , n, while X i remain unobserved.</p><p>We denote marginal density functions and probabilities by p(•) and conditional ones by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(•|•). The measurement model for X i for a unit i is given by p(Y i |X i , Z i ) = p(Y i |X i = c) = K k=1 p(Y ik |X i = c) = K k=1 R k r=1 π I(Y ik =r) kcr</formula><p>(1) for c = 1, . . . , C, where π kcr are probability parameters and I(Y ik = r) = 1 if unit i has response r on measure k, and 0 otherwise. This is the measurement model of the latent class model with K categorical indicator variables for C latent classes. It is assumed here that Y i are conditionally independent of Z i = (Z pi , Z oi ) given X i (i.e. that Y i are purely measures of the latent X i and there are no direct effects from other observed variables Z i to Y i ), and that the indicators Y ik are conditionally independent of each other given X i . These are standard assumptions of basic latent class analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">The structural model p(Z i , X i ) = p(Z pi )p(X i |Z pi )p(Z oi |Z pi , X i ) specifies the joint distribution of Z i and X i . Then p(Z i , X i , Y i ) = p(Z i , X i )p(Y i |X i )</formula><p>, and the distribution of the observed variables is obtained by summing this over the latent classes of X i to get</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(Z i , Y i ) = p(Z pi ) C c=1 p(X i = c|Z pi ) p(Z oi |Z pi , X i = c) K k=1 p(Y ik |X i = c) .</formula><p>(2)</p><p>This model thus combines a latent class measurement model for X i with a structural model for the associations between X i and observed covariates Z pi and/or response variables Z oi .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-step estimation</head><p>September 7, 2017</p><p>Substantive research questions typically focus on those parts of the structural model which involve X, so the primary goal of the analysis is to estimate p(X i |Z pi ) and/or p(Z oi |Z pi , X i ). The measurement model is then of lesser interest, but it too needs to be specified and estimated correctly to obtain valid estimates for the structural model, not least because the measurement model provides the definition and interpretation of X i . The marginal distribution p(Z pi ) can be dropped and the estimation done conditionally on the observed values of Z pi .</p><p>For simplicity of illustrating the methods in specific situations, we will focus on structural models where either Z p or Z o is absent. These cases will be considered in our simulations in Section 3 and the examples in Section 4. We thus consider first the case where there is no Z o and the object of interest is p(X i = c|Z pi ), the model for how the probabilities of the latent classes depend on observed covariates Z p . This is specified as the multinomial logistic model</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p(X i = c|Z pi ) = exp(β 0c + β c Z pi ) C s=1 exp(β 0s + β s Z pi )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for c = 1, . . . , C, and (β 01 , β 1 ) = 0 for identifiability (and β c and Z pi are taken to be row vectors). Second, we consider the case where there is no Z p and the object of interest is the units i are independent, the log likelihood for θ is (θ) = n i=1 log p(Z oi , Y i |Z pi ), obtained from (2) by omitting the contribution from p(Z pi ). Maximizing (θ) gives maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of all of θ. These are the one-step estimates of the parameters. They are most conveniently obtained using established software for latent variable modelling, currently in particular Latent GOLD or Mplus. These software typically use the EM algorithm, a Two-step estimation quasi-Newton method, or a combination of them, to maximize the log likelihood. They also provide other estimation facilities which are important for complex latent variable models, such as automatic implementation of multiple starting values.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p(Z oi |X i ),</formula><p>Stepwise methods of estimation begin instead with the more limited log likelihood</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1 (ρ, π) = n i=1 log p(Y i ), where p(Y i ) = C c=1 p(X i = c) K k=1 p(Y ik |X i = c) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>π are the same measurement parameters (response probabilities) as defined above, and Since the step-1 model gives estimates of p(X i = c) and p(Y i |X i = c), it also implies estimates of the probabilities p(X i = c|Y i ) of latent class membership given observed response patterns Y i . In step 2 of a three-step method, these conditional probabilities are used in some way to assign to each unit i a value ci of a new variable Xi which will be used as a substitute for X i . The most common choice is the "modal" assignment, where ci is the single value for which p(X i = c|Y i ) is highest. In naive three-step estimation, step 3 then consists of using Xi as an observed variable in the place of X i when estimating the structural models for the associations between X i and Z i , to obtain naive three-step estimates of the parameters of interest ψ p and/or ψ o . These estimates are, however, generally biased, because of the misclassification error induced by the fact that Xi are not equal to X i . It is important to note that this bias arises not just from modal assignment but from any step-2 assignment whose misclassification is not subsequently allowed for; this includes even methods where each unit is assigned to every latent class with fractional weights which are proportional to p(X i = c|Y i ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dias &amp; Vermunt, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ρ = (ρ 1 , . . . , ρ C ) with ρ c = p(X i = c) = p(Z pi )p(X i = c|Z pi )</formula><p>Bias-adjusted three-step methods remove this problem of the naive methods. Their basic idea is to use the estimated misclassification probabilities p( Xi = ci |X i = c i ) of the values assigned in step 2 to correct for the misclassification bias.

In contrast, step 3 of the ML method involves maximizing a log likelihood which has the same form as (θ), except that p(Y i |X i ) is replaced with p( Xi |X i ) and this fixed at its estimate from step 2 (it is thus closer in spirit to the two-step method, whose second and final step will involve similar fixing, but applied directly to p(Y i |X i )). Both of these adjusted three-step methods are available in Latent GOLD and Mplus, while in other software additional programming would be required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The proposed two-step method</head><p>We propose a two-step method of estimation. Its first step is the same as in the three-step methods, that is estimating the latent class model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) without covariates or response variables Z. Some or all of the parameter estimates from this model are then passed on to the second step and treated as fixed there while the rest of the parameters of the full model are estimated.</p><p>Let θ = (θ 1 , θ 2 ) denote the decomposition of θ into those parameters that will be estimated in step 1 (θ 1 ) and those that will be estimated in step 2 (θ 2 ). There are two</p><p>possibilities regarding what we will include in θ 1 (these two situations are also represented graphically in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). If there are any covariates Z p , then θ 1 = π, i.e. it includes only the parameters of the measurement model (and estimates of ρ from step 1 will be discarded before step 2). If there are no Z p , then θ 1 = (π, ψ p ), i.e. it includes also the probabilities ψ p = ρ of the marginal distribution of X. The logic of this second choice is that if X is not a response variable to any Z p , we can treat it as an exogenous variable whose distribution can also be estimated from step 1 and then treated as fixed when we proceed in step 2 to the estimation of models conditional on X. Thus θ 2 includes either all the parameters (ψ p , ψ o ) of the structural model, or all of them except those of an exogenous X.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=========================</head><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> about here ========================= Denoting the estimates of θ 1 from step 1 by θ1 , in step 2 we use the log likelihood 2 ( θ1 , θ 2 ), which is n i=1 log p(Z oi , Y i |Z pi ) evaluated at θ 1 = θ1 and treated as a function of θ 2 only. Maximizing this with respect to θ 2 gives the two-step estimate of these parameters, which we denote by θ2 . This procedure achieves the aims of stepwise estimation, because the measurement model is held fixed when (all or most of) the structural model is estimated. If we change the structural model, θ1 remains the same and only step 2 is done again (or even if we do run both steps again, θ1 will not change). This would be the case, for example, if we wanted to compare models with different explanatory variables Z p for the same latent class variable X.</p><p>Another useful aspect of separating the estimation of the measurement and structural models is that the estimates θ1 and θ2 may be obtained using different samples. A common example of this is that some observations which are used for step 1 may be omitted in step 2 because of missing data in Z. A more dramatic instance occurs when, because of resource constraints, Z is measured for a subset of units only, so that step 1 is based on a much larger sample (for example, this was a key motivation of two-step estimation in the application considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xue &amp; Bandeen-Roche, 2002)</ref>. Conversely, we might sometimes decide to keep θ1 unchanged even when new data on Z become available, so that step 2 may be based on a larger sample (or even a completely different sample) than step 1. In all of these cases, the two-step estimate θ2 will be consistent for θ 2 as long as the data are such that one-step estimates obtained from the step-2 sample would also be consistent (for example, that any missing data there are ignorable for likelihood inference), and that even if the step-1 and step-2 samples are different they both represent populations where the true value of θ 1 is the same.</p><p>Although we focus here on the case of a single X for simplicity, the idea of the two-step method extends naturally also to more complex situations. For instance, suppose that there are two latent class variables X 1 and X 2 with separate sets of indicators Y 1 and Y 2 , and the</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">structural model is of the form p(X 1 )p(Z 1 |X 1 )p(X 2 |Z 1 , X 1 )p(Z 2 |X 1 , Z 1 , X 2 ).</formula><p>In step 1 we would then estimate two separate latent class models, one for X 1 and one for X 2 (and both again without Z = (Z 1 , Z 2 )). The step-1 parameters θ 1 would be the measurement probabilities of X 1 and X 2 and the parameters of p(X 1 ), and the step-2 parameters would be those of the rest of the structural model apart from p(X 1 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Properties and implementation of two-step estimates</head><p>Two-step estimation in latent class analysis is an instance of a general approach to estimation where the parameters of a model are divided into two sets and estimated in two stages. The first set is estimated in the first step by some consistent estimators, and the second set of parameters is then estimated in the second step with the estimates from the first step treated as known. When the second step is done by maximizing a log likelihood, as is the case here, this is known as pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gong &amp; Samaniego, 1981)</ref>. The properties of our two-step estimators can be derived from the general PML theory.</p><p>Such two-stage estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under very general regularity conditions (see <ref type="bibr">Gourieroux &amp; Monfort, 1995, Sections 24.2.4 and 24.2.2)</ref>. In our situation these conditions are satisfied because the one-step estimator θ and the step-1 estimator θ1 of the two-step method are both ML estimators, of the joint model and the simple latent class model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) respectively, and because the models are such that θ 1 and θ 2 can vary independently of each other. Suppose that step 2 is based on n observations and step 1 on n 1 observations (which may be different, as discussed above). Let the Fisher information matrix for θ in the joint (one-step) model be</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">I(θ * ) =   I 11 I 12 I 22  </formula><p>where θ * denotes the true value of θ and the partitioning corresponds to θ 1 and θ 2 . The asymptotic variance matrix of the one-step estimator θ is thus V M L = I -1 (θ * )/n, which is estimated by VML = I -1 ( θ)/n. Similarly, let Σ 11 /n 1 be the asymptotic variance matrix of the step-1 estimator θ1 of the two-step method, obtained from the Fisher information matrix for model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) and evaluated at the true values (ρ * , π * ) of its parameters; this is estimated by substituting the step-1 estimates for these parameters. The asymptotic variance matrix of the two-step estimator θ2 is then V/n, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">V = I -1 22 + I -1 22 I 12 [(n/n 1 )Σ 11 ] I 12 I -1 22 ≡ V 2 + V 1 (5)</formula><p>where the (n/n 1 ) adjusts for the possibly different sample sizes in the two steps (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xue &amp; Bandeen-Roche, 2002)</ref>. Here V 2 describes the variability in θ2 if the step-1 parameters θ 1 were actually known, and V 1 the additional variability arising from the fact that θ 1 are not Two-step estimation known but estimated by θ1 . Comparable methods for bias-adjusted three-step estimators, which also allow for both of these sources of variation, have been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakk, Oberski, and Vermunt (2014a)</ref>. V is estimated by V = V2 + V1 , obtained by substituting θ = ( θ1 , θ2 ) for θ * in I 22 and I 12 in (5), evaluated using the n observations used for step 2, and the estimate from step 1 for Σ 11 . The estimated variance matrix V/n is then used to calculate confidence intervals for the parameters in θ 2 , and Wald test statistics for them.</p><p>The standard errors that are routinely displayed by the software when we fit the step-2 model are based on V2 only. Because they omit the contribution from V1 , these standard errors will underestimate the full uncertainty in θ2 . In the simulations of Section 3 we examine the magnitude of this underestimation in different circumstances. The results suggest that the contribution from the step-1 uncertainty can be substantial, and that it can be safely ignored only if the measurement model is such that Y are very strong measures of X.</p><p>As noted in the previous section, if the joint model had more than one latent class variable X, in the first step we would propose to estimate the latent class models for each of these variables separately. Even then, the estimated parameters of these models would be correlated, because they are estimated using data for the same units. An estimate which takes this into account can be obtained from the theory of estimating equations, using only the score functions and information matrices for the separate models (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cameron &amp; Trivedi, 2005</ref>, Section 5.4). A still simpler approach would be to approximate Σ 11 by a block-diagonal matrix, with the blocks being the variance matrices for the distinct latent class models. This would ignore the correlations between these blocks of step-1 parameter estimates and would thus imply some misspecification of the resulting form of V 1 , but we might expect the effect of this misspecification to be relatively small.</p><p>In the appendix we outline how the quantities in (5) may be calculated. In practice, however, it is typically best to implement these calculations using established software for latent variable modelling. If we have software which can fit the full model using the one-step approach, it can be adapted to produce also the point estimates and their variance matrix for the two-step approach. First, θ1 and Σ11 are obtained by fitting the step-1 latent class model.</p><p>Second, θ2 and V2 are obtained by fitting a model which uses the same code as we would use for one-step estimation, except that now the values of θ 1 are fixed at θ1 rather than estimated.</p><p>After these steps, the only quantity that remains to be estimated is I 12 , the cross-parameter block of the information matrix I(θ * ). In some applications of PML estimation this can be an awkward quantity which requires separate calculations. Here, however, it too is easily obtained. This is because software which can fit the one-step model can also evaluate this part of the information matrix. All that we need to do to trick the software into producing the estimate of I 12 that we need is to set up estimation of the one-step model with θ = ( θ1 , θ2 ) as the starting values, get the software to calculate the information matrix with these values (i.e.</p><p>before carrying the first iteration of the estimation algorithm), and extract from it the part corresponding to I 12 . [The code included in the supplementary materials for this article shows how this and the other parts of the two-step estimation can be done in Latent GOLD.]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Simulation studies</head><p>In this section we carry out simulation studies to examine the performance of the two-step estimator and to compare it to the existing one-step and three-step estimators. The simulations consider the two specific situations which were discussed in Section 2.3 and represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, i.e. one with models where the latent class is a response variable and one where it is an explanatory variable. The settings of the studies draw on those of previous simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vermunt (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakk et al. (2014a)</ref>.</p><p>In all of the simulations there is one latent class variable X with C = 3 classes. It is measured by six items Y = (Y 1 , . . . , Y 6 ), each with two values which we label 0 and 1. The more likely response is 1 for all six items in class 1, 1 for three items and 0 for three in class 2, and 0 for all items in class 3. The probability of the more likely response is set to the same value π for all classes and items. Higher values of π mean that the association between X and Y is stronger, separation between the latent classes larger, and precise estimation of the latent class model easier. We use for π the values 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7, and call them the high, medium and low separation conditions respectively. Thus, the probabilities of the response 1 are, for example, all 0.9 in class 1 in the high-separation condition, and (0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3) in class 2 in the low-separation condition. The association between X and Y can be summarised by the entropy-based pseudo-R 2 measure (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Magidson, 1981)</ref>: here its value is 0.36, 0.65 and 0.90 in the low, medium and high-separation conditions respectively. We consider simulations with sample sizes n of 500, 1000, and 2000, resulting in nine sample size-by-class separation simulation settings in each of the two situations we consider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-step estimation</head><p>In the first simulations the structural model is the multinomial logistic model (3) where the probabilities p(X = c|Z p ) of the latent classes are regressed on a single interval-level covariate Z p with uniformly distributed integer values 1-5. Class 1 is the reference level for X, and the coefficients for classes 2 and 3 are β 2 = -1 and β 3 = 1. The intercepts were set to values yielding equal class sizes when averaged over Z p . In the second set of simulations the structural model is a linear regression model with X as the covariate for a continuous response Z o which is normally distributed with residual variance of 1 (except in one simulation at the end, where violations of this distributional assumption are considered). Omitting the intercept term but including dummy variables for all three latent classes, the regression coefficients We compare the two-step estimates to ones from the one-step method, the naive three-step method with modal assignment to latent classes in step 2, and the "BCH" and "ML" methods of bias-adjusted three-step estimation. The models were estimated with Latent GOLD Version 5.1, with auxiliary calculations done in R (R Core Team, 2016). In each setting, 500 simulated samples were generated. In a small number of samples in the low-separation condition (11 of the 500 when n = 500, and 4 when n = 1000) one or both of the bias-adjusted three-step methods produced inadmissible estimates (the reasons for this are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al., 2013)</ref>, and these samples are omitted from the results for all estimators. The two-step method produced admissible estimates for all of the samples.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">β 1 = -1, β 2 =</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=========================</head><p>Insert Table <ref type="table">1</ref> about here ========================= Results of the simulations where X is a response variable are shown in Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and<ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>For simplicity we report here only results for one of the regression coefficients, which had the true value of β 3 = 1 (the results for the other coefficient were similar). Table <ref type="table">1</ref> compares the performance of the different estimators of this coefficient in terms of their mean bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the simulations. We note first that the one-step estimator is essentially unbiased in all the conditions and has the lowest RMSE. The naive three-step estimator is severely biased (and has the highest RMSE), with a bias which decreases with increasing class separation but is unaffected by sample size. The bias-adjusted three-step Two-step estimation methods remove this bias, except in cases with low class separation where some of the bias remains. These results are similar to those found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vermunt (2010)</ref>.</p><p>The two-step estimator is comparable to the bias-adjusted three-step estimators, but consistently slightly better than them. Its smaller RMSE suggests that there is a gain in efficiency from implementing the stepwise idea in this way, avoiding the extra step of three-step estimation. In the medium and high-separation conditions the two-step estimator also performs essentially as well as the one-step estimator, suggesting that there is little loss of efficiency from moving from full-information ML estimation to a stepwise approach.</p><p>The low-separation condition is the exception to these conclusions. There all of the stepwise estimators have a non-trivial bias and higher RMSE than the one-step estimator (although the two-step estimator is again better than the bias-corrected three-step ones). A similar result was reported for the three-step estimators by Vermunt ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>) and (in simulations where X was a covariate) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al. (2013)</ref>. They concluded that this happens because the first-step estimates are biased for the true latent classes when the class separation is low. They also observed that the level of separation in the low condition considered here (where the entropy R 2 is 0.36) would be regarded as very low for practical latent class analysis, i.e. if the observed items Y were such weak measures of X they would provide poor support for reliable estimation of associations between the latent class membership and external variables. The one-step estimator performs better because the covariate Z p in effect serves as an additional indicator of the latent class variable, and indeed one which is arguably stronger than the indicators Y in the low-separation condition (for example, the standard R 2 for Z p given X is here 0.48).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=========================</head><p>In Table <ref type="table">2</ref> we examine the behaviour of the estimated standard errors of the two-step estimators, obtained as explained in Section 2.4. We compare them to the one-step estimator (for which the standard errors are obtained from standard ML theory and should behave well), omitting the three-step estimators which are not the focus here (simulation results for their estimated standard errors are reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vermunt, 2010 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakk et al., 2014a)</ref>.</p><p>The first three columns for each estimator in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> show the simulation standard deviation of the estimates of the parameter, the average of their estimated standard errors, and the coverage proportion of 95% confidence intervals calculated using the standard errors.</p><p>Here the one-step and two-step estimators both behave well in the medium and high separation conditions, in that the standard errors are good estimates of the sampling variation and the confidence intervals have correct coverage or very close to it (with 500 simulations, observed coverages between 0.932 and 0.968 are not significantly different from 0.95 at the 5% level). The variability of the estimates is also comparable for the two methods, again indicating that the two-step method is here nearly as efficient as the one-step method. An exception is again the low-separation condition, where the variability of the two-step estimators is higher. Even then their estimated standard errors correctly capture this variability, so the undercoverage of the confidence intervals in the low-separation condition is due to the bias in the two-step point estimator which was shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>The last two columns of Table <ref type="table">2</ref> examine the performance of estimated standard errors of the two-step estimators if they were based only on V 2 in (5), i.e. if we ignored the contribution from the uncertainty from the first step of estimation which is captured by V 1 .</p><p>The "C95(2)" column of the table shows the coverage of 95% confidence intervals if we do this, and "SE%(2)" shows the percentage that the step 2-only standard errors contribute to the full standard errors (this is calculated by comparing the simulation averages of these two kinds of standard errors). It can be seen that in the low-separation conditions around half of the uncertainty actually arises from the step-1 estimates, and ignoring this results in severe underestimation of the true uncertainty and very poor coverage of the confidence intervals.</p><p>Even in the more sensible medium-separation condition the contribution from the step-1 uncertainty is over 10% and the coverage is non-trivially reduced, and it is only in the high-separation condition that we could safely treat the step-1 estimates as known. These results suggest that there is a clear benefit from using standard errors calculated from the full variance matrix (5) derived from pseudo-ML theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=========================</head><p>Insert  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and<ref type="table">4</ref> show the same statistics for the simulations where the latent class X is an explanatory variable for a continuous response Z o . Here we again focus on just one parameter in this model, with true value β 2 = 1. The results of these simulations are very similar to the ones where X was the response variable (and for the one-step and three-step estimators they are also similar to the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al., 2013)</ref>. The two-step estimator again performs a little better than the three-step estimators and, except in situations with low class separation, essentially as well as the one-step estimator.</p><p>It is also of interest to consider to what extent the different estimators may be sensitive to misspecifications of different parts of the models. In a further simulation, for which the point estimates are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, we examine this with respect to violations of the assumptions about the distribution of a continuous outcome Z o . Here the settings are the same as in the medium-separation condition with the sample size of 1000 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, except that the true distribution of the residuals in the model for Z o given X differs in one of three ways from the homoscedastic normal distribution which is assumed by the estimators. In the first case, it is a mixture of the normal distributions N (-0.5, 0.15) and N (0.75, 1.3375), with weights 0.6 and 0.4 respectively; this has variance 1 but is positively skewed, with an index of skewness of 1.16</p><p>(roughly the same as that of the χ 2 6 distribution). In the second, it is a mixture of N (0.9, 0.19) and N (-0.9, 0.19) with equal weights; this is symmetric with variance 1, but is very clearly bimodal. In the third case, the residual distribution is normal but heteroscedastic, in that its variance is 1 in two of the latent classes but 5 in one of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=========================</head><p>Insert Table <ref type="table">5</ref> about here ========================= We may anticipate that the BCH and naive three-step methods should be robust in this respect, because in step 3 they use standard linear regression (weighted or unweighted) for Z o given assigned values of X, which does not rely on parametric assumptions about the residual distribution. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows that this is indeed the case, and for these estimators the results are Two-step estimation essentially the same as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. In contrast, the one-and two-step methods and the 3-step ML method each use in their last step a log-likelihood which involves a distribution for Z o .</p><p>Their estimates may then become biased when the fitted model tries to reconcile the assumed homoscedastic normal distribution of Z o with the observed data, and for one-step estimates this bias may be further increased because the method allows the latent classes themselves to be affected by the observed distribution of Z o . Here these effects are, however, small in the cases with skewed or bimodal distributions. For them, the two-step and one-step estimates remain comparable in RMSE, and somewhat better than the adjusted three-step estimates.</p><p>In the case of a heteroscedastic residual distribution, the lowest RMSEs are achieved by the BCH estimates. All the other estimates have some bias, which affects different class-specific mean parameters differently (and for one of them has a very large bias for the one-step estimates). This case suggests that the one-and two-step methods may be most sensitive when the violations of the distributional assumptions vary by latent class; for one-step estimates, results for such situations are also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bakk and Vermunt (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Asparouhov and Muthén (2015)</ref>, from simulations which use class-specific and severely bimodal residual distributions. It should be noted, however, that these model violations are of a kind which should in practice not go unobserved by the data analyst, but would be easily detectable even from a preliminary analysis with naive three-step estimation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-step estimation</head><p>For the definitions of variables and for the first-step latent class modelling we follow the choices made by the previous authors (data and code for the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakk et al., 2014a is</ref> given in <ref type="bibr">Bakk, Oberski, &amp; Vermunt, 2014b[, and for our analysis in [final]</ref> supplementary materials for this article]). The original survey measured a respondent's tolerance of communists, atheists, homosexuals, militarists and racists, using three items for each of these groups. The items asked if the respondent thought that members of a group should be allowed to make speeches in favour of their views, teach in a college, and have books written by them included in a public library (the wordings of the questions are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McCutcheon, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Thus "tolerance" here essentially means willingness to grant members of a group public space and freedom to disseminate their views. McCutcheon recoded the data into five dichotomous items, one for each group, by coding the attitude toward a group as tolerant if the respondent gave a tolerant answer to all three items for that group, and intolerant otherwise.</p><p>The first-step latent class analysis is carried out on a sample of 2689 respondents who had an observed value for all five items. This complete-case analysis was used to match that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McCutcheon (1985)</ref>. It is not essential, however, and all of the estimators can also accommodate observations with missing values in some of the items (we will do that in our second example in Section 4.2). There were further 21 respondents who are excluded from estimation of the structural model because they had missing values for the covariates.</p><p>We use the same four-class latent class model for the tolerance items which was also employed by the previous authors. Its estimated parameters are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>. The upper part of the table gives the estimated parameters of the measurement model, that is the probabilities π kc1 = P (Y ik = 1|X i = c) that a respondent i who belongs to latent class c gives a response which is coded as tolerant of group k. Using the labels introduced by McCutcheon, the class in the first column is called "Tolerant" since respondents in this class have a high probability of being tolerant of all five groups. The "Intolerant of Right" class is intolerant of groups such as racists and militarists and the "Intolerant of Left" class particularly intolerant of communists, while the "Intolerant" have a low probability of a tolerant response for all five groups. The entropy-based pseudo-R 2 measure is here 0.72, placing the separation of these classes between the medium and high-separation conditions in our simulations in Section 3.</p><p>The last row of the table gives the estimated probabilities ρ of the latent classes; these show that the intolerant class is the largest, with a probability of 0.56.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-step estimation</head><p>The one-step estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref> are rather more different from all the stepwise estimates. This difference arises from a deeper discrepancy than just that of different estimates for the same parameters. Here the parameters are in fact not the same, because the one-step estimates are effectively coefficients for a different response variable. This point is demonstrated in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>. It shows the estimated measurement probabilities and marginal class sizes of the latent class model from one-step estimation with different choices of the covariates in the structural model. The first column for each class shows the results when no covariates are included, so it is the same as the model in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref> (with the classes there numbered here 1-4 in the same order). We refer to this pattern and interpretation of the classes as "pattern A". The estimates from one-step estimation follow this pattern also if the structural model includes only the birth cohort, or the cohort plus education included as years completed rather than in the grouped form. In other words, in these cases the one-step estimates of the measurement probabilities of the latent classes are sufficiently similar from one model to the next so that the interpretation (and labelling) of the classes remains unchanged, even though the exact values of these probabilities still change between models.</p><p>In other models, however, the estimated measurement model changes so much that the latent classes themselves change. We refer to these cases in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> as "pattern B" (nearest matches from the two patterns are shown under the same number of class in the table). In this pattern the Tolerant class maintains its interpretation and estimated size, but the other three classes are re-arranged so that we end up with two classes (numbers 2 and 4) with slightly different patterns of low tolerance and one class (3) with a probability of a tolerant response around 50% for all the groups. This pattern emerges when the structural model includes education alone in either years completed or in the grouped form. It also emerges when the covariates are cohort and the grouped education, which was the model we considered in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>. The one-step model there is thus a model for latent classes of pattern B (with the measurement probabilities shown in the second column for each class in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>), whereas all the stepwise models are for classes of pattern A.</p><p>This example illustrates the inherent property of one-step estimation that every change in the structural model will also change the measurement model. Sometimes these changes are small, such as those between the different versions of pattern A in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>, but sometimes they are so large, such as the jumps between patterns A and B, that they effectively change Two-step estimation the meaning of the latent class variable. There is no reason even to expect that the possible patterns would be limited to two as here, so in analyses with a larger number of covariates still more patterns could appear. In practical analysis it could happen that the analyst failed to notice these changes and hence to realise that comparisons between some structural models were effectively meaningless. Even if the analyst did pay attention to this feature, there is nothing they could really do about it within one-step estimation. This is because the method provides no entirely coherent way of forcing the measurement model to remain the same. In contrast, all stepwise methods achieve this by definition, because their key feature is that the measurement model is fixed before any structural models are estimated.</p></div>

These data were used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al. (2013)</ref> to compare the one-step and bias-adjusted three-step approaches, and we follow their choices for the models and variables. The goal is to examine the association between an individual's perceived job insecurity and their perception of their own and their employee's obligations in their current employment (the "psychological contract"). Job insecurity is measured on a scale used by the PSYCONES project (originally from De <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Witte, 2000)</ref>, treated as a continuous variable. Psychological contract types are measured by eight dichotomous survey items. Four of them refer to perceived obligations (promises given) by the employer and four to obligations by the employee, and in each group of four, two items refer to relational and two to transactional obligations. The labels in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">9</ref> give an idea of the items' content, and their full wordings are given by De Cuyper, Rigotti, Witte, and Mohr (2008) who also analysed these items (for a different sample) with latent class analysis.

In general, all of the methods considered here can accommodate units of analysis which have missing data in some of the items. For estimation steps which employ a log-likelihood of some kind (such as one-step estimation and both steps of two-step estimation) this is done by defining it in such a way that all observed Two-step estimation variables contribute to the log-likelihood for each unit, and for the second step of the three-step methods it is achieved by calculating the conditional probability of latent classes given all the observed items for each unit. Four respondents for whom the measure of job insecurity was not recorded are omitted when the structural model is estimated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The stepwise approaches that we have explored in this article are motivated by the principle that definitions of variables should be separated from the analyses that use them.</p><p>This is natural and goes unmentioned in most applications where variables are treated as directly observable, where they are routinely defined and measured first and only then used in analysis. Things are not so straightforward in modelling with latent variables, where these variables are defined by their estimated measurement models. One-step methods of modelling do not follow the stepwise principle but estimate simultaneously both the measurement models and the structural models between variables. As a result, the interpretation of the latent variables may change from one model to the next, possibly dramatically so. Stepwise methods of modelling avoid this problem by fixing the measurement model at its value estimated from their first step. In naive three-step estimation this incurs a bias because the derived variables used in its third step are erroneous measures of the variables defined in the first step. This bias is removed by the bias-adjusted three-step and the two-step methods. In this article we have argued that the two-step method that we have proposed is the more straightforward of them, and has somewhat better statistical properties.</p><p>Other properties of the two-step method remain to be studied further. These include, for example, its robustness to violations of assumptions in different parts of the joint model. In Section 3 we examined this briefly with respect to distributional assumptions about a continuous response variable, with results which suggested that two-step estimates are fairly robust in this respect, somewhat more so than one-step estimates but less so than some three-step estimates. The conclusions may be different for other parts of the structural and measurement models. A particularly important question of this kind is the assumption that the measurement model depends only on the latent class X but not on other variables Z. This is the assumption of measurement equivalence (absence of differential item funtioning), which may be violated in many applications. Here observing that one-step estimates change when variables in the structural model are changed may itself be a sign that the measurement model is misspecifed in this respect. Questions of interest about non-equivalence of measurement are not limited to the sensitivity of estimates if it is wrongly ignored, but include also how two-step estimation could be used to detect non-equivalence and to estimate models which allow for it. This is an important topic for future research on the two-step approach.</p><p>We have focused on latent class analysis, but both the methods and the principles that we have described apply also more generally. They could be extended to models with other kinds of latent variables, such as linear structural equation models (SEMs) where both the latent variables and their measures are treated as continuous. In this context, the one-step method (conventional SEMs) and the naive three-step method (using factor scores as derived variables) are routinely used, while other stepwise methods are not fully developed. There too the one-step approach has the property that the measurement models of the latent factors do not remain fixed, although it could be that the consequences of this are less dramatic than they can be for the categorical latent variables in latent class analysis. Two-step estimation can be defined and implemented for models with continuous latent variables in the same way as described in this article for latent classes, in effect by making the appropriate changes to the distributions defined in our Section 2. The behaviour of the two-step approach in this context remains to be investigated.</p><p>with p(Z pi ) omitted.

If the parameters for the different components of the model are distinct, which should be the case for most sensible models, we only need to consider the separate derivatives of the terms in this sum.

The substantive research question is whether different levels and patterns of intolerance are associated with individuals' education and birth cohort. We use data from the 1976 and 1977 U.S. General Social Surveys (GSS) which was first analyzed by McCutcheon (1985) using the naive three-step method with modal assignment of latent classes to individuals. Bakk et al. (2014a) re-analyzed the data using the one-step and bias-corrected three-step methods, thus showing how McCutcheon's original estimates are affected when the misclassification from the second-step class allocation is taken into account. We examine how two-step estimates compare with these previously proposed approaches in this example.</figDesc></figure>

The overall Wald tests show that both education and birth cohort have clearly significant associations with membership of the different tolerance classes. People from the older cohorts are more likely to be in the Intolerant of Left and (especially) the Intolerant classes, but there is no significant cohort effect on being in the Intolerant of Right rather than Tolerant class.</figDesc></figure>

Here the naive three-step estimates are the most different, in that they are closer to zero than are the other estimates. The rest of the estimates are similar, and the one-step ones are now also comparable to the rest because their estimated measurement model (not shown) implies essentially the same latent classes as the first-step estimates used by the stepwise approaches. The estimated coefficients show that the expected level of perceived job insecurity is similar (and not significantly different) in the Mutual High and Under-obligation classes, and significantly higher in the Overobligation and Mutual Low classes (which do not differ significantly from each other).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Appendix: Score functions and information matrices for latent class models Consider first in general terms a model which involves a latent class variable X with a total of C latent classes (here X may also represent all combinations of the classes of several latent class variables). Suppose that the model depends on parameters θ (in this appendix we take all vectors to be column vectors, the opposite of the practice in Section 2 where they were row vectors for simplicity of notation). The log likelihood contribution for a single unit i is then l i = log L i = log C c=1 L ic , where L ic = exp(l ic ) is the term in L i which refers to latent class c = 1, . . . , C. The contribution of unit i to the score function is then</p><p>and u ic = ∂l ic /∂θ, and the contribution to the observed information matrix is</p><p>where</p><p>Suppose that observations for different units i = 1, . . . , n are independent. Point estimation of θ is easiest with the EM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dempster, Laird, &amp; Rubin, 1977)</ref>. For this, let l * i be the same expression as l ic but now regarded as a function of c. At the E-step of the (t + 1)th iteration of EM we calculate</p><p>ic l ic where π (t) ic = p(X i = c|D, θ (t) ), D denotes all the observed data and θ (t) is the estimate of θ from the tth iteration. At the M-step, Q (t+1) is maximized with respect to θ to produce an updated estimate θ (t+1) . This is relatively straightforward because ∂Q (t+1) /∂θ = i c π</p><p>ic J ic , i.e. these are the score function and observed information matrix for a model where X is known, fitted to pseudodata of n × C observations with fractional weights π (t) ic . The information matrix I for the model can be estimated by n -1 i J i or n -1 i u i u i . Together with u i , these could also be used to implement other estimation algorithms than EM.</p><p>When evaluated at the final estimate of θ, they give estimates of the I 22 and I 12 which are needed for the two-step variance matrix ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>). An estimate of the Σ 11 that is also needed there is obtained similarly from the estimated information matrix for the step-1 latent class model.</p><p>What then remains to be done for any specific model is to evaluate l ic , u ic and (if used) J ic for it. As an example, consider the model with covariates Z p , one latent class variable X, and a response variable Z o which was considered in Section 2.1. The L i for it is given by (2)</p></div>
