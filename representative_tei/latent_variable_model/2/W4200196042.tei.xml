<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Latent variable models are important for condition monitoring as they learn, without any supervision, the healthy state of a physical asset as part of its latent manifold. This negates the need for labelled fault data and the application of supervised learning techniques. Latent variable models offer information from which health indicators can be derived for condition monitoring. Namely, information from the latent space and the data space can be used for condition inference.</p><p>These health indicators are used to explain changes in a physical asset's condition. Conventional black-box approaches only offer information from the data space in the form of reconstruction errors. In contrast, latent variable models offer a latent space and reconstruction space for inference. However, the current application of latent variable models either disregards latent space information or fails to realise its full potential. The full potential can be realised by preserving the time information in the data. Therefore, we propose a model evaluation procedure that specifically preserves time in the latent health indicators. The procedure is generic and can be applied to any latent variable model as demonstrated for Principal Component Analyis (PCA), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in this study. In general, as time information can be discarded or preserved for derived latent health indicators, this study advocates that health indicators that preserve time are more useful for condition monitoring than health indicators that discard time. In addition, it enables the interpretation of the learnt latent manifold dynamics and allows for alternative latent indicators to be developed and deployed for fault detection. The proposed temporal preservation model evaluation procedure is applied to three classes of latent variable models using two datasets. Three model-independent latent health indicators that preserve time are proposed and shown to be informative on all three classes of latent variable models for both datasets. The temporal preserving latent analysis procedure is demonstrated to be essential to derive more informative latent metrics from latent variable models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Vibration-based condition monitoring is an important field that addresses the need to optimise and improve the utilisation of expensive machine assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The goal of condition monitoring is to uncover the presence, if any, of vibration signatures that are indicative of faults. This goal requires that the performance of condition monitoring techniques be robust to variations in operating conditions as this may complicate the condition inference procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These applications of condition monitoring techniques are commonly referred to as asset degradation assessment or the diagnostics problem and the prognostics problem. In the literature, advanced signal processing and learning-based techniques have been widely investigated. Both are working towards the unified goal of improving the performance capabilities of condition monitoring techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>For the diagnostics problem, the objective is to use a health indicator (HI) to infer the asset's condition. The development of HIs is an active research endeavour centred around asset degradation assessment techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. These techniques aim to quantify the asset condition by detecting and enabling fault trending <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Examples of traditional HIs include the root-mean-square value, peak value, crest factor and kurtosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The spectral kurtosis is a statistical quantity used to detect signal impulsiveness, or a deviation from Gaussianity, and is commonly used to determine frequency bands where impulsive signal components dominate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In Antoni and Borghesani <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, statistical HIs were designed to detect stationarity and/or Gaussianity deviations. In Wang and Tsui <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, a generalised dimensionless HI is proposed using the probability density function of a noncentral chi-square distribution defined over the variance-normalised square envelope.</p><p>In Booyse et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was used to develop a HI from the GAN discriminator function, which was used to measure the deviance from a healthy asset state.</p><p>Signal processing-based methods and learning-based methods can both provide indicators, but the two fields differ in fault covariate extraction practices. Signal processing techniques are designed using extensive domain knowledge. In contrast, learning-based techniques such as statistical learning and machine learning initially utilised advanced feature engineering to improve model performance in classification or regression tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Deep learning introduced powerful nonlinear parametric functions commonly referred to as deep neural networks, which extract features from raw time-series signals for condition inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>However, many learning-based approaches are black-box models for semi-supervised learning optimisation using classification losses, reconstruction losses, or combining the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The term black-box is used in this work to refer to a model in which there is little understanding of the facets of the model other than the output it provides. This induces a natural blind spot for learning-based approaches as certain model facets are never fully addressed as the focus is to maximise method performance. Another issue inherent to supervised learning techniques is the data label problem.</p><p>The costly and dangerous nature of failure in critical assets introduces limited access to extensive fault data. Usually, a vast amount of healthy asset data is available, as the percentage of time an asset spends in a failure state is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. A large portion of the recent learning-based literature addresses this problem using semi-supervised learning techniques and domain-transfer learning. These techniques require access to some labelled fault classes from the asset of interest or an identical or different machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>An alternative solution to the data label problem is to use healthy time-series asset data to learn a probabilistic representation of the asset in a healthy state <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. By learning this representation, the data label problem is bypassed as the primary interest is to measure if unseen data is from this representation. This probabilistic representation learning process manifests through density estimation learning techniques, often classified in the literature under the banner of unsupervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For density estimation, latent variable models (LVMs) are considered a cornerstone <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>LVMs are techniques that assume that unobserved latent variables are used as conditioning variables for the observed data, and this manifold describes the intrinsic structure of this data. LVMs are used to learn the representation of a healthy asset state. This approach is powerful, but its potential is not fully realised in current methods due to inadequate data analysis and latent analysis procedures. Specifically, the latent manifold is often left as a black-box facet that is a simple by-product of the model formulation. However, under the manifold hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, it would be expected that if the manifold represents healthy data, unhealthy data should not lie in the same area of the manifold.</p><p>A common process in the learning-based literature is the use of a set overlap percentage when performing time-series signal segmentation for models trained on raw time-series data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. This time-series data evaluation approach is commonly used for both training and evaluation. This may be key to reduce the input feature dimensionality but breaks the temporal structure in the data. The temporal structure referred to here is not the time between recorded time-series data but the time structure within this data. Our work emphasises that this local data timeframe must be preserved. This preservation is atypical but offers much potential in vibration-based CM. Using large overlapping segments is sufficient for model training. However, this can hinder the condition inference procedure during the model evaluation step due to anomalies in time-series data that are localised as the damaged portions move through the loading zone. This is the Achilles' heel of current LVM techniques and disrupts the temporal information in time-series data. Furthermore, present methods cannot readily detect anomalous instances in the latent manifold unless fault labels are supplied. These labels are used to cluster the data, or an adversarial training scheme is required to regularise the encoding transition function to provide an additional health indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>A rational guide to overcoming this flaw exists in discrepancy analysis techniques. Localised discrepancy measures are obtained using a healthy probabilistic representation, and these measures quantify the deviation from the healthy data distribution over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. These discrepancy measures are also obtained with crafted signal segmentation approaches that exploit external information such as tachometer signals to carefully design a statistical analysis methodology for specific fault cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. LVMs cover one-half of discrepancy analysis techniques, whereby a model is used to capture the healthy data density. Once this density has been learnt, HIs are used as representative metrics to evaluate whether new data is from this distribution. However, exploiting additional information during the pre-processing stage is counter-productive to deep learning, aiming to only use raw time-series data to train models. This work proposes that by preserving the temporal structure, LVMs' full potential can be harnessed, and this preservation introduces informative latent health indicators (LHIs). The benefit of the proposed LHIs is that they are generic and can be used with any LVM that makes a continuous and temporally preserved latent space available. The contribution of this work is the augmentation of the LVM analysis approach by preserving the time dimension. This augmentation allows for increased analysis flexibility as time structure is introduced into the HI measures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1</ref> details this augmentation clearly for a signal with a localised fault. In the conventional latent analysis setting shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1</ref>(a), the HI measures from the signal contain healthy and anomalous characteristics, while the cause of the anomalies is unclear. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1</ref>(b), the distinct healthy and anomalous (or unhealthy) regions are seen in the proposed analysis setting. Since time is preserved, it is also possible to extract more information from this HI signal using conventional signal analysis approaches (e.g. time synchronous averaging, spectral analysis), making it possible to identify the source of the unhealthy behaviour.</p><p>By ensuring that the temporal structure in the time-series data is preserved, incipient fault detection, fault isolation, and fault trending become viable avenues of investigation, which are crucial facets of vibration-based fault diagnostics. Temporal preservation is also model agnostic, which introduces a generic analysis setting that exploits the temporal structure in the time-series data for improved diagnostic performance. Figure 1: The differences between the conventional analysis approach and the proposed analysis approach for a damaged time-series signal.</p><p>In the conventional setting, notice how there appears to be HI measures in both the expected healthy density region and some outliers, but this cannot be easily explained. In the proposed setting, it is clear that the unexplained healthy measures are simply those from a healthy local region in the time-series signal. A reformulation of the model evaluation approach used in deep learning practices is essential, and therefore a temporal preservation approach is proposed. This reformulation adds improved model interpretability, HI interpretation and the condition inference process. The latent manifold of LVMs is explored, and its responsiveness to anomalous instances is investigated. The main contributions of this research are summarised as follows:</p><p>1. A reformulation that exploits the natural temporal structure in the data used in the model evaluation procedure results in HI signals that are more informative. The preservation of temporal structure allows multiple facets of the discrepancy signals to be exploited for condition inference.</p><p>2. The latent manifold is shown to be interpretable and responsive to anomalous data samples. A set of LHIs is proposed to be applied to any continuous latent manifold with temporal structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Temporal preservation enables</head><p>LHIs to be derived that consider the latent manifold's path information and trajectory dynamics instead of only state information of the latent manifold.</p><p>As this work aims to utilise the full potential of LVMs, three different models are considered. These models are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and a Disentangled Latent Space Generative Adversarial Network (DLS-GAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Many models are available, but the selected methods are sufficient to investigate the LVM class, model complexity to highlight the temporal preservation approach's potential combined with the proposed LHIs. The performance of common HIs and the proposed LHIs is critically compared on datasets with constant and time-varying operating conditions. The first dataset investigates a gear tooth fault in a gearbox with time-varying operating conditions to highlight the improved condition inference procedure obtained when using the temporal preservation approach. This is achieved by using this approach to improve the quality of the HI signals. We show that the proposed LHIs obtained from the proposed framework can detect asset damage in the latent manifold under time-varying operating conditions. The second dataset is a bearing run-to-failure dataset under constant operating conditions. This dataset is used to compare the performance of the various HIs and LHIs developed under the temporal preservation approach against state-of-the-art signal processing and deep learning literature. The important techniques relating to LVMs and the temporal preservation approach are introduced, and the application to vibration-based condition monitoring is addressed in Section 2. The HI and LHIs obtained from different models are then evaluated on experimental data and compared in Section 3. Finally, the research is concluded, and recommendations for future work are provided in Section 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Introduction</head><p>This work aims to use LVMs as a method to transform time-series data to a set of HIs from which the condition of an asset may be inferred. LVMs have been used for anomaly detection tasks. However, this work will investigate how anomalous instances are represented in the latent space and propose a set of model agnostic scalar indicators that can be used to detect anomalous instances in the latent manifold. To do this, the basic components of an LVM must be understood, and the components of the model that apply to condition monitoring must be detailed. LVMs are well documented in the literature and are often used for unsupervised learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Unsupervised learning differs from supervised learning and some semi-supervised learning techniques in the distribution of interest. Unsupervised learning is concerned with density estimation tasks, such as capturing the distribution p(x) over the data space x. In supervised learning, and in most semi-supervised learning cases, the objective is to infer a variable y given a sample x. These learning methodologies are used in learning-based literature and can be classified into statistical learning, machine learning or deep learning based on model flexibility and pre-processing applicability.</p><p>In the density estimation process, LVMs assume that an unobserved latent variable z describes the data. The assumption is often made that this latent variable space is of a lower dimension to the data space R latent ≤ R data . A generative view of these models is developed by assuming a prior p(z) over z and a conditional generative distribution p(x|z) from which data samples are drawn. The data distribution p(x) is then given through the marginalisation of the joint distribution p(x, z) with respect to the latent variables p(x) = p(x|z)p(z)dz.</p><p>(</p><p>It is then often important to evaluate the posterior distribution using Bayes' theorem for model inference to obtain latent samples from the data samples, which can be obtained through</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(z|x) = p(x|z)p(z) p(x) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>These two processes are key to LVMs and are succinctly demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, where two parametric functions f φ and g θ are used to map samples from the data space to the latent space and vice versa. The parametric functions f φ and g θ are commonly referred to as the encoder and decoder, and these functions are used to parametrise the inference and generative distributions p(z|x) and p(x|z). The placement of the latent prior with respect to the latent manifold is demonstrated to enforce the requirement that f φ transforms input feature samples in a region similar to p(z) to ensure that data samples can be generated through sampling p(x|z) from a sample z ∼ p(z).</p><p>Three common operations can be described when using LVMs. The first is the data generation process which occurs through sampling a point in the latent space z ∼ p(z) and then drawing a data sample from the conditional distribution p(x|z), which is obtained through x = g θ (z). The second is the input reconstruction process which is obtained from and the learnt latent manifold through the inference network f φ .</p><p>sampling x ∼ p(x) and using both transition functions to produce a reconstructed sample x = g θ (f φ (x)). The final process is the model inference step that obtains a latent code for a sample x ∼ p(x) using z = f φ (x). It is important to note that not all LVM methods focus on both parametric functions, and the choice of which parametric function is learnt affects the framework's versatility, as this restricts which model operations are available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Proposed latent variable analysis method</head><p>In this work, LVMs are used to capture the representation of a healthy asset. This process allows for health indicators to be obtained that track the deviation from this healthy representation. To pre-process the data, typically, a sliding window with an overlap percentage is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data features and increase the training dataset's size <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The overlap percentage removes the temporal structure of the time-series data in the signal segments seen by the model, which inhibits the condition inference procedure by limiting the operations that can be performed on the HI or LHI signals. A temporal preservation approach is used during model evaluation to preserve time in the obtained condition indicators for a given signal. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the difference between the conventional approach and the approach proposed in this work. It is emphasised that the model training procedure for LVMs from conventional applications is sufficient. Hence this element of the LVM application remains unchanged. The temporal preservation approach proposed in this work requires that time-series data be fed through the model incrementally to obtain condition indicator signals that</p><p>have temporal structure during model evaluation. This decision is beneficial as it produces informative health indicators, and these signals are now considered a transformation that may enhance the presence of fault covariates in the data.</p><p>Furthermore, to explore the latent manifold, it is beneficial to preserve time as this allows for the path traversed in the latent space to be investigated.</p><p>To develop a set of scalar metrics that can be used to interpret the latent manifold, the deviation paths from the latent space must be conceptually quantified. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, the potential paths of latent traversal are highlighted to the reader, and these paths illustrate plausible directions of traversal for data from an asset with a localised fault and data from an asset with a distributed fault, such as distributed gear wear. As highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a), it is difficult to distinguish between the latent space's localised and distributed gear faults. However, as demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(b), we can clearly distinguish between the two fault cases if we use the temporal information.</p><p>There are two primary means of anomaly detection in the manifold, one through off-manifold deviance and another The difference in analysis methodology between current literature approaches and the proposed temporal preservation approach.</p><p>It is key to note that the difference only manifests during the model evaluation stage, where the temporal structure of the vibration data is preserved. This difference allows for the development of more informative HIs and LHIs. The kσ rule, where k ∈ N, is formulated under a Gaussian distribution assumption that is validated under a Gaussian null hypothesis.</p><p>through the manifold's path traversal properties. As the latent manifold is representative of healthy data, anomalous data may manifest in the non-healthy manifold regions. As LVMs control the structure of the latent manifold to bear resemblance to a prior distribution p(z), this deviation may be quantified through the log-likelihood of the latent samples under the prior p(z). Furthermore, as the manifold has temporal structure in the temporal preservation framework, dynamic properties such as the traversal rate may change without deviating to regions of low likelihood under the prior 160 p(z), which is static with respect to time. The traversal rate may serve as a suitable indicator to detect unhealthy data.</p><p>Temporal preservation is key to interpret changes in the latent manifold as the temporal structure of the data can be used to track the path traversed through this manifold. The temporal preservation approach introduces structure to our data analysis. As a result, the data structure is preserved in a low-dimensional representation in the latent manifold. This configuration is used to interpret the latent manifold, thereby allowing time to be untangled. Deviations in the static and 165 dynamic properties of the latent manifold may now be quantified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data pre-processing</head><p>In this work, the raw time-series data must be reduced in dimensionality to satisfy computational limitations and to produce a dataset that can be used to optimise the model parameters. Firstly, the available healthy vibration data is processed according to a sliding window scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The data is developed into a Hankel matrix H <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> by storing segments of a size designated by the model window length L w and overlap controlled by the shifting parameter L sf t . L w and L sf t control the amount of signal information seen by the model and the amount of overlap between signal segments, respectively. L w is the model window length or segment length, and L sf t is the segment overlap length. Signal segments  are developed by sliding the window and storing segments for measurement x i through</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H(x i ) =         x i (0) x i (1) x i (2) • • • x i (L w ) x i (L sf t ) x i (L sf t + 1) x i (L sf t + 2) • • • x i (L w + L sf t ) x i (2L sf t ) • • • x i (L w + 2L sf t ) . . . . . . . . .         ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where H ∈ R N obs ×Lw and N obs is the number of windows extracted from a single signal. This process is then repeated for the n available healthy vibration data signals and each matrix is concatenated to develop the data matrix X data through</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X data =         H(x 1 ) H(x 2 ) . . . H(x n )        <label>(4)</label></formula><p>where X data ∈ R n * N obs ×Lw . Common to any learning-based application, the X data is then partitioned into a training and validation set that is used to train the model. It is a requirement for this work that the training data consist only of signal segments from the asset in a healthy condition. For model training in this study, the shift parameter is selected as L sf t = 0.5L w , and the data is standardised using</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">X data = X data -µ train σ train ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where µ train ∈ R Lw and σ train ∈ R Lw are the healthy X data matrix feature mean and standard deviation. The set of model parameters are then optimised using X data . Finally, it is conventional to use Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) with L sf t = 0.5L w , µ train and σ train to process and standardise all available vibration data to evaluate HI metrics for each segment. The statistical properties of the HI measures are analysed to infer the condition of the asset.</p><p>In this work, the proposed temporal preservation approach preserves the temporal structure in the segments of X data during the model evaluation process by re-evaluating Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) with L sf t = 1. This step ensures that when HI and LHI measures are obtained, the temporal structure in the resulting HI or LHI signal is preserved. This preservation ensures the structure in the time-series data is now retained in the evaluation step. Furthermore, the HI and LHI signal is a transformed representation of the time-series signal. This allows for each segment to be consistently quantified as there is now a preserved relationship to time. To highlight additional considerations into the choice of model window length, consider Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>: The interaction between model window length Lw, signal sampling frequency Fs and the shaft speed fs visualised. Note here that the shaft speed is used as a proxy for the presence of faults, as fault frequencies are often proportional to the shaft speed.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> describes the relationship between L w , the signal sampling frequency F s and the shaft speed f s . The shaft speed and sampling frequency give an important lower bound to L w , which develops due to the periodicity of localised faults in relation to the shaft speed. This bound assumes that the faults occur at least once per shaft revolution. If the window length L w is less than the ratio Fs fs , one may obtain signal segments from a damaged signal that contains no fault covariates. Naturally, a combination of F s , f s and fault frequency proportion that ensures the presence of fault covariates within signal segments. However, we are not aware of a universal rule that overcomes this issue.</p><p>The temporal preservation approach offers an improved methodology that can be used to better analyse time-series signals and can improve the model diagnostic performance. By being aware of this phenomenon, a variety of signal analysis techniques can be performed, allowing for further exploitation and investigative flexibility for condition inference.</p><p>Techniques that may be applied to the HI or LHI signals for condition inference interpretation are, for example i) signal statistics, ii) the time-synchronous average, and iii) a spectral analysis. This combination of deep learning and signal processing techniques enhances the condition inference procedure. It introduces a natural unification where deep learning highlights the fault covariates, and signal processing can be used to extract the fault information.</p></div>

In contrast, implicit models use an adversarial scheme with a discriminative function to quantify the difference between the real and generated data. The simplest LVM<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> that is available is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that assumes that p(z|x) and p(x|z) are explicitly parametrised by Gaussian distributions with linear transition functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In the PCA framework, Tipping and Bishop <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> show that the transition functions reduce to f φ = U and g θ = U T where U is the hierarchically organised data covariance eigenvector matrix, often referred to as the Principal Component (P C) matrix. The Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) framework generalises the linear PC transition function to learn a nonlinear parametric encoder and decoder network that represent the explicitly assumed Gaussian distributions p(z|x) and p(x|z).</p><p>This data reconstruction loss guides this process L(θ, φ) = 1 2 xx 2 2 , often referred to as the L 2 or mean-squared error (M SE) loss, and the latent Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence loss D KL (q(z|x) p(z)), which regularises the encoder to enforce that data is encoded into a space similar to the assumed latent prior. GANs aim to improve the generative capacity of g θ by replacing the explicit generative log-likelihood with the likelihood ratio r = p data (x|z) q θ (x|z) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This decision allows for the generative distribution to implicitly capture the data distribution, providing natural flexibility to g θ extending past Gaussian distributions. However, the original GAN framework cannot perform model inference. Thus, various techniques have been proposed in the literature to produce a framework that benefits from the GAN adversarial framework while still recovering latent codes. In some frameworks, a combination of the adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the InfoGAN framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is used to improve the generative capacity of g θ , and Mutual Information maximisation is used to introduce explicit latent disentanglement losses into the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, a generic LVM training framework highlights different latent regularisation strategies and highlights how the GAN framework is typically incorporated for nonlinear implicit formulations. It is important to note that some implicit techniques still incorporate the auto-encoder losses, which induces a trade-off between the explicit and implicit frameworks. A suitable latent prior p(z) for latent regularisation is an isotropic Gaussian distribution. Its isotropic nature can provide some implicit independence on the learnt posterior distribution to ensure that each latent dimension is independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>To use LVMs for fault detection, the various facets of the model are exploited. For example, models that make explicit Gaussian distribution assumptions, such as PCA or VAEs, can access the reconstruction log-likelihood to measure the likelihood that a sample is from the generative distribution p(x|z). For models that use or incorporate implicit distribution assumptions such as GANs, a data discriminator D χ (x) is made available to measure how likely an observed sample is in relation to the learnt healthy data distribution, as shown in Booyse et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In Baggeröhr <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, an auto-encoder with an adversarial optimisation scheme was used as a latent regularisation methodology for the latent manifold alongside an InfoGAN framework to improve the generative capacity of the generative distribution. This technique uses a Wasserstein metric latent critic function D ω (z) to measure how likely a latent sample was from the learnt latent space <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The current application of LVMs can consider both the data space and the latent manifold. However, the latent manifold has never been analysed to consider the path traversed through the manifold. Furthermore, latent critic regularisation is not LVM agnostic as the KL divergence regularisation term was explicitly replaced.</p><p>Once a latent variable model has been trained, it offers indicators from its latent and data space by feeding data through the model, as highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Consider the case where a signal with a fault is fed through an LVM, with HI measures obtained using the current approach and the proposed temporal preservation approach. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1</ref>, an illustrative example of the differences between the conventional and proposed evaluation procedures is detailed. To assess whether this data is healthy, a healthy reference distribution, is created and the likelihood of the collected HI measures is evaluated, as detailed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1</ref>(a). However, suppose there are healthy signal segments in the processed vibration signal. In that case, one may obtain likelihoods that are not indicative of a fault, and the signal may be incorrectly deemed healthy. In the proposed procedure, the introduction of time can be used to visualise the HI measures through time. This process will correctly clarify the presence of the healthy segments due to the type of fault present in the data and the chosen model window length. Furthermore, as the HI signal is a transformation of the original time-series signal, alternative techniques such as the HI signal Fourier transform can confirm the source of the measure deviations, or the statistics of the HI signal can be trended through time.</p><p>It is emphasised here that the methods used in this paper are merely incidental. Numerous alternative techniques exist in the literature, but investigation of these techniques is beyond the scope of this work. This work primarily focuses on the temporal preservation analysis of latent spaces to derive temporally structured HIs from LVMs applied to time-series data. The aim is not to identify the best LVM or to propose an improved LVM. Unsupervised latent variable models are used to capture an asset's healthy manifold under the condition monitoring objective to monitor changes in the asset condition over time. In this study, the effect of model complexity is explored by considering linear and nonlinear parametric functions, and the impact of latent disentanglement <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is investigated through implicit and explicit latent disentanglement regularisation. More powerful parametric functions may offer improved mapping flexibility to the latent manifold and may allow the manifold to capture data space nonlinearities. Latent disentanglement is crucial to latent manifold anomaly detection as an entangled manifold may hinder the condition inference procedure. Suppose damage is present in the time-series data. In that case, the detection of these instances in an entangled latent manifold may be corrupted by changes in other generative factors such as the asset operating condition. Besides, time-preserved latent analysis enables time-preserved health indicators that preserve the temporal structure that allows for more distinct and informative HI to be developed and derived. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Proposed health indicators</head><p>It is possible to collectively identify potential HIs commonly available to LVMs, as detailed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>. These HIs can be informative, but important information in the data is lost when the temporal information is not preserved. This restriction on the data impedes the condition inference task and stops the full potential of LVMs from being realised.</p><p>To assess the potential of LVMs, the temporal information in the data must be preserved to improve the quality of the  Commonly used HIs are functions of the model framework. For models that assume Gaussian generative distributions, a reconstruction metric is developed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">HI (1) (x, x, σ 2 ) = - 1 D D k=1 (x k -x k ) 2 σ 2 k ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>which is the reconstruction log-likelihood for an input x, its reconstructed mean x and variance σ 2 . This term can also be considered to be the negative squared Mahalanobis distance for a factored Gaussian distribution. The second HI that is available for implicit density estimation techniques is the GAN data discriminator</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">HI (2) (x) = D χ (x),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>which is based on the input feature space x. For condition monitoring applications, the data discriminator D χ (x) estimates the likelihood that any observed data is from the healthy asset data distribution. The third health indicator is that of the Wasserstein metric estimate</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">HI (3) (z) = D ω (z),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>which may be based in the input feature space or, as indicated, based on the latent feature space z if it is used as an adversarial latent regularisation strategy. This learnt metric measures whether any latent representation z is from the prior p(z).</p><p>The temporal preservation approach allows for the development of LHIs that can be used to interpret where data lies in the latent manifold and detects off-manifold traversal. These LHIs form the foundation for latent analysis, where latent analysis refers to the analysis of the latent manifold. To detect changes in the latent manifold, three latent metrics are proposed in this work and are given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">LHI (1) t = z t+1 -z t 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">LHI (2) t = z t 2 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">LHI (3) t = cos -1 z T t+1 z t z t+1 2 z t 2 , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where z t indicates the latent space representation at any point t ∈ [0, L d -1] from the temporal preservation analysis procedure where L d = L signal -L w and • 2 is the L 2 norm. LHI (1) is the latent distance norm between two timecontinuous latent representations and allows one to interpret the inter-time distance characteristics of the latent space.</p><p>LHI (1) is also a proxy to the latent traversal velocity if the data sampling rate F s is constant. LHI (2) is the trivial calculation of the latent Euclidean norm and measures the distance of a latent sample from the Cartesian origin. LHI (1)     was derived using the Mahalanobis distance, a commonly used distribution distance metric, for the isotropic Gaussian prior distribution p(z). LHI (3) can be interpreted as the angle between two points in the latent space and allows one to interpret the directional characteristics of the latent manifold. Many alternative LHIs can be developed as this interpretation of the latent manifold has not been rigorously optimised and improved. The optimisation of the LHI set is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>We use the proposed LHIs to gain insight into how unhealthy time-series data may be represented in a latent space representative of healthy data. The static properties of the manifold are quantified through the negative log-likelihood of a latent sample z using the prior p(z), as the prior is time-invariant. The dynamic properties of the manifold can be quantified by considering the positional behaviour of the path followed through the latent space. LHI (1) quantifies the positional behaviour in a Cartesian coordinate system, while LHI (3) quantifies the positional behaviour in a non-Cartesian coordinate system. Static and dynamic behaviour can be distinctly isolated as the temporal preservation approach untangles time in the manifold, which allows for time axis exploitation to produce scalar metrics.</p><p>The combination of the temporal preservation analysis and the proposed LHIs can lead to an interpretable latent space and introduce a level of intuition into how different latent manifolds respond to anomalous data. It is also key to note that LHI (1) and LHI (3) cannot be intuitively developed without preserving the temporal structure of the data. The term interpretation is used in the context of a latent manifold to describe how these metrics quantify the manifold response to anomalous data instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental investigation</head><p>The experimental investigation demonstrates informative generic HIs used with various LVMs when preserving time structure during the models' evaluation. The temporal preservation approach ensures that the model's full potential is used during the condition inference stage for LVM-based CM. This comes through augmenting conventional LVM analysis with signal processing techniques, an endeavour that is only possible through temporal preservation, which naturally allows for more fruitful insights. Not only can fault detection and trending occur, but the type of fault can also be inferred.</p><p>In this way, the emphasis is not to identify the best HI, LHI and LVM combination or to propose the best combination, as this is problem-dependent. Rather, this study highlights the benefit offered from the temporal preservation approach over conventional approaches. The proposed temporal preservation approach and LHIs are evaluated using the considered LVMs on two experimental datasets. The first dataset has time-varying operating conditions, and the second dataset has stationary operating conditions. Health indicator denoising, albeit interesting, is beyond the scope of this work. For those interested, results provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> are relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Latent variable model application</head><p>For the experimental investigations in this work, the models considered are PCA, VAEs and the DLS-GAN method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. For PCA, a cumulative contribution rate (CCR) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">CCR = M i=1 λ i N i=1 λ i ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where λ i is the i th largest eigenvalue of the training data covariance matrix. This ratio allows for the data variance capture rate to be enforced to rationalise the number of M eigenvectors used, M ≤ N . This work will investigate the effect of learning on output variance from the VAE decoder µ, σ 2 I = g θ (z). This variance may improve the discrepancy metric responses from HI (1) by quantifying the expected feature changes. Models with and without this learnt variance are denoted with subscripts V AE 2 and V AE 1 , respectively. For the DLS-GAN method, the methodology proposed in Ding and Luo <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is augmented to introduce a continuous latent code s with an isotropic latent prior p(s) = N (0, I).</p><p>This decision splits the latent space Z latent into three components, Z latent = [c, s, n] where c is a discrete categorical code and n is a continuous random noise code. This decision adds two L 2 losses to the DLS-GAN formulation, one included in the generative InfoGAN element of the model and one added when enforcing latent n separation, thereby adding two additional β weighting parameters to the final DLS-GAN objective function. Furthermore, the latent component n is regularised with an adversarial training scheme to match an isotropic Gaussian prior p(n) = N (0, I) using a Wasserstein GAN critic with gradient penalty, which provides access to HI (3) for this model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. This decision replaces L M M D (φ) with L W GAN (φ, ω), which introduces an additional parametric critic function D ω (z n ) that is used to regularise the encoder. Furthermore, the GAN generator loss is changed to use the KL divergence loss proposed in Sønderby et al.</p><p>[37] to produce favourable generator gradients during training.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Gearbox dataset</head><p>The experimental gearbox dataset used in this research was obtained from the Centre for Asset Integrity Management laboratory at the University of Pretoria. This dataset has been extensively analysed in the works of Schmidt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>This dataset was used as it exhibits time-varying operating conditions. As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>, the experimental setup consists of an electrical motor, one step-down helical gearbox, two-step up helical gearboxes, and an alternator. The centre gearbox from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref> was used in the experiments, and a tri-axial accelerometer was mounted to the bearing casing such that the axial acceleration could be measured. The input and output operating condition states of the gearbox are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>. Note that the Bayesian Geometry Compensation (BGC) method proposed by Diamond et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> was A proximity probe and an optical probe were mounted to the test gearbox's output and input shafts, respectively. The sampling rate of the optical probe was set to F s = 51.2kHz.  The objective of this dataset is to highlight that by using the temporal preservation approach, more informative HIs can be obtained from LVMs, the presence of damage can be uncovered in the HI signals and in the latent manifold and this damage can be visualised using a unification of signal processing and deep learning techniques. To investigate this dataset, a simple statistical investigation was performed into the signals from the two datasets. To quantify the dataset complexity, two versions of the gearbox dataset were considered. The first version is when the time-series data were low-pass filtered using a third-order Butterworth filter around 3200Hz, and the second version is the original unfiltered dataset. This was done as the unfiltered dataset's data contained significant impulses in both the healthy and unhealthy states. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>(b), the record kurtosis is given. A detectable change in the record kurtosis for the filtered dataset occurs around the transition from the healthy dataset to the unhealthy dataset. The effect of low-pass filtering is clear in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>(b), where the unfiltered record kurtosis is significantly larger and clearly shows the presence of the signal impulsiveness that was filtered out of the filtered dataset. Due to this clear impulsivity, the authors chose to investigate the performance on the low-pass filtered dataset to compare the different metrics' performance without complicating the signal information with non-damage impulsive components, as was done in the work of Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The investigation of LVM performance under complex non-Gaussian signal information will be considered in future work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">used</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Model Development</head><p>To develop the training and validation datasets for model optimisation, the first fifty records from the healthy dataset were low-pass filtered and then processed using Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) with L sf t = 0.5L w . The dataset X data was then partitioned into X train and X valid using an 80 -20% ratio with signal segments chosen randomly. Once the model parameters were optimised, X data was re-evaluated using all the available data for the proposed temporal preservation approach from Section 2 and standardised using µ train and σ train from the original training dataset. This re-evaluation step is not performed in the conventional setting, and the only LHI measure available is LHI (2) . Condition indicator signals were obtained from each model by passing X data through the models and developing discrepancy signals using the HIs and LHIs as detailed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>. To quantify the benefit of the proposed approach, the results from the conventional analysis setting will be shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Conventional analysis</head><p>In the conventional setting, LVM-based CM analysis is a histogram analysis procedure, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3(a)</ref>. This procedure uses the histograms of the healthy training data HI and LHI measures to compare and quantify whether any new measures are from the healthy asset state. To this effect, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the classification accuracy become features of interest. The ROC curve tracks the false positive rate (FPR) against the true positive rate (TPR) as the healthy histogram threshold is varied against a set of test HI measures. In this work, the AUC metric is favoured over the ROC curve as it summarises the ROC curve information in a single scalar. A fault classification analysis is also performed. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a healthy/unhealthy threshold is chosen to induce a 10% FPR. For CM applications, a 10% FPR on the healthy data implies that 10% of the healthy HI or LHI measures used for model training are classified as damaged. The classification accuracy under the 10% threshold reflects the likelihood of health state deviation in the signals of interest, which serves as a proxy to fault detection.</p><p>To showcase the ROC curve and histogram results for this dataset, the results from the V AE 1 model are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10</ref>. It is clear from Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">10(a</ref>) and (b) that although there is a fault present from record 100, the ROC curves for the HI (1) and LHI (2) measures are insensitive to the fault. The ROC curves for the records with damage never obtain a good TPR at low FPRs, highlighting the shortcoming of the conventional approach as damage is not identifiable. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">10(c</ref>) and (d), it is clear that there is some increase in the HI and LHI measures from record 100, but this is not significant enough to show a clear deviation from the learnt healthy state. The ROC curve responses in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">10(a</ref>  from the healthy state in the damaged records. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10</ref>(d) the shift in the histogram for the unhealthy test data is attributed to the experimental breakpoint.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref>, the AUC and classification accuracies for the models considered in this work are shown. The AUC and classification accuracy indicate poor performance from HI (1) and LHI (2) as there is no growth from record 100, except for the V AE 2 model. The V AE 2 response growth is attributed to reconstruction loss overfitting to the training data.</p><p>However, it is clear that the latent manifold AUC and classification accuracy has no overfitting phenomenon present. This indicates the duality of the learnt variance reconstruction loss and the learnt manifold, as the model has exploited the 380 additional variance flexibility to reconstruct the training data better. In contrast, the manifold indicates that the data between records 50 and 100 are from the same healthy distribution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref> demonstrates that limited insight can be drawn from the models for CM condition inference under the conventional analysis setting. The conventional analysis approach is limited by the reformulation of the inference objective to a classification setting, which relies on strong and consistent HI or LHI measure deviations. Furthermore, the latent manifold cannot be further investigated or explored as there is no temporal structure.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Temporal preservation analysis</head><p>In contrast to the conventional approach, it is possible to use conventional signal analysis methods to process the health indicators under temporal preservation. In this section, the time-synchronous average (TSA) of the HI and LHI signals is used for condition inference and obtained from</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">x T SA (n) = 1 N r Nr-1 i=0 x(n + iN s ), where 1 ≤ n ≤ N s ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where the signal x(n) is processed to contain N r rotations consisting of N s points per rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. The geometrical imperfection of the tachometer butt joint is used to align the different measurements. It is important to highlight that signal processing techniques are used to enrich the condition inference procedure, but the models were trained on the raw vibration data. This demonstrates the power of the temporal preservation approach, as it allows for the natural exploitation of signal processing techniques that can uncover the presence of fault covariates. Condition inference may be performed using the processed discrepancy signal's statistics. However, it was found that these statistics were insufficient to detect damage on this dataset. For the models used for this dataset, the window length was chosen as L w = 512.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">12</ref> shows the difference in average feature reconstruction error between the training and validation set to motivate this decision. The latent size and model window size affect the model's reconstruction ability, with a clear decreasing trend as the window length is lowered. This is attributed to the information in each signal segment, as shorter segments have less information that the model has to capture and decreases the emphasis of larger frequency components. The chosen window length was selected as it is near the region of error stability, and it offers a model with a larger number of parameters to improve model flexibility.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">13</ref>, the HI (1) and LHI (1-3) TSA responses are shown from the PCA model. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">13</ref>(a), the gear tooth fault is around 140 • but to prove that the fault has occurred is non-trivial due to apparent activity at other angular increments. It is clear from Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">13(b-d</ref>) that there is damage present in the latent manifold and specifically emphasised by LHI (2) . Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">13(c</ref>) and (d) show a clear spike attributed to the tooth fault's presence. There is some noticeable deviation around record one hundred, which manifests from the experimental interruption to seed the fault.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">16</ref> show the HI (1) and LHI (1-3) TSA responses for the V AE 1 and V AE 2 models. The benefit of transition function nonlinearity is evident, whereby the response from HI (1) clearly shows the presence and development of the fault. The effect of the V AE 2 model's learnt variance is evident through a greater response magnitude in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">14</ref>(b). To demonstrate the implicit nature of the model window length on discrepancy signals, consider the HI (1) TSA signal as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15</ref> for window lengths of L w = 1024 and L w = 2048 using the V AE 2 model. Notice the decreased influence of the gear tooth fault. This phenomenon occurs as each segment captures more of the impulsive components that were not filtered out, explaining the deviations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">12</ref> as the window length increases. This degrades the fault covariate information captured by the HI discrepancy signal, and the fault inference procedure is therefore degraded.</p><p>Under the examination of the latent manifold, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">16</ref>, through latent metrics LHI (1-3) , it is clear that the latent distance, LHI (1) , is a poor metric for condition inference on this dataset. Both LHI (2) and LHI (3) show the presence of the tooth fault. Interestingly, the latent manifold is responding similarly to that seen from PCA in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">13</ref>. This is attributed to the shared L 2 loss that is used to develop these models. The L 2 loss is obtained from the explicit assumption that the generative distribution is Gaussian. This explicit choice of distribution may also explain why we cannot analyse simple discrepancy signal statistics or larger model windows, as the remaining impulsive signal  PCA, the CCR rate was investigated rather than the size of Z latent , and for DLS-GAN, Z latent refers to the dimensionality of the n space.</p><p>components that were not filtered out are known to be strongly non-Gaussian.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">17</ref>, the HI (1-3) and LHI (1-3) TSA responses are shown from the DLS-GAN model. This model offers two additional discrepancy metrics, and these metrics analyse both data samples and latent samples. It is clear that the parametric function nonlinearity improves the results obtained, with improved reconstruction metric response under the TSA. The data discriminator response in HI (2) is notably uninformative, with no detectable fault development. This is attributed to the conflicting training objective from the AAE and InfoGAN frameworks. This difference manifests in the learnt data distribution from the explicit and implicit training schemes for the AAE and GAN frameworks. This difference negatively favours training the data discriminator, as the MSE loss will naturally dominate the training as it is more stable. The latent critic response, HI (3) , shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">17</ref>(c), indicates some damage, but there is some activity at other angular positions. This is attributed to the critic's design to use only latent samples and not exploit their time dependency. Thus, the manifestation of natural data perturbations in the latent manifold may corrupt the condition inference process. This is explained in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">17(d)</ref>, (e) and (f), which shows the latent metric response. LHI (2) and LHI (3) are informative metrics for condition inference.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Discussion</head><p>From the presented results in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, the benefits of the proposed method are clear: by preserving time and using the latent information, it is possible to find powerful health indicators that can be analysed using established signal analysis methods. By utilising signal analysis methods, it is possible to enhance the anomalous components and to identify their source. This section compares the performance of the health indicators obtained using the temporal preservation approach and the conventional approach. To quantify the temporally preserved HI and LHI response performance, it is required that a condition deviance point be prescribed to the various TSA responses. This is non-trivial for the current T SA representations. This requires that a technique be used that transforms the individual HI and LHI signals into an interpretable result that can be trended through time. Schmidt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> introduced a method that uses k-means clustering to assign two centroids µ max and µ min , to a single discrepancy signal. These means are trended through time, and the larger of the two is used for condition inference. This approach may be used should one wish to identify a condition deviance point, but this is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>The objective of this discussion is to further highlight the benefit of the temporal preservation approach over the conventional approach through direct comparison. To ensure comparison consistency, the V AE 1 model records histograms for the T SA of the HIs and LHIs are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">18</ref>. The histograms are centred by removing the median from the T SA for each record. This step is not integral to the proposed approach. Rather, it emphasises the damage sensitivity in the T SA and where damage manifests in the record histograms. Removing the median is not universally applicable to all fault cases. However, as the localised fault has been identified this has no impact and this step simply removes any data nonstationarity that is not due to the tooth fault.</p><p>In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">18(a</ref>  are clear healthy and unhealthy regions. The LHI 1 response seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">18</ref>(b) is expected as there is no apparent damage seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">16</ref>(a). This variance manifestation is caused by the interaction between L w and the fault frequency, (a) HI (1) : DLS-GAN (b) HI (2) : DLS-GAN (c) HI (3) : DLS-GAN (d) LHI (1) : DLS-GAN (e) LHI (2) : DLS-GAN (f) LHI (3) : DLS-GAN which indicates that there are many signal segments that are healthy, with only a few segments that contain the localised 460 damage. Hence, metrics that monitor deviations in the variance of the T SA are suited to identify condition deviance points, such as the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This result is crucial to highlight the shortcoming of the conventional approach, as the interaction between L w and the fault may cause the ROC, AUC and classification accuracy metrics from the conventional approach to be biased towards poor performance. Naturally, L w may be increased to reduce this bias, but, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15</ref>, this decreases the ability to perform fault localisation. For this reason, the AUC and the classification accuracy are not shown for the temporal preservation approach, as this information is not a true representation of the model responses for the chosen L w . However, this level of insight is only available through the temporal preservation approach, which enriches the condition inference procedure and deepens analysis inference.</p><p>When comparing Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">18</ref>, it is clear that the temporal preservation approach offers numerous benefits during the condition inference stage. Damage was detected using the HIs and the proposed LHIs, highlighting that preserving temporal structure is key to manifold interpretation in LVM-based CM. The results of the HIs and LHIs under the temporal preservation approach indicates that the decision to obtain more informative health indicators is beneficial to condition monitoring and will enable future research to improve the methods used by using an improved analysis methodology. The use of simple signal processing techniques, such as the T SA, can enhance the condition inference stage by exploiting the temporal structure that is preserved during model evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">IMS dataset</head><p>The Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) dataset is a well-used bearing failure dataset used for benchmarking condition monitoring methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. This dataset consists of three run-to-failure sub-datasets containing accelerometer data from an experimental setup, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">19</ref>, consisting of four double row Rexnord ZA-2115 bearings. The experimental setup ran under a constant load of 6000lbs and a constant shaft speed of 2000rpm. In each dataset, a 1s vibration sample was obtained under a sampling rate of F s = 20.48kHz. For this work, the second IMS dataset will be investigated, and this dataset contained 984 measurements throughout the experimental lifespan. The second IMS dataset had an outer race bearing fault that occurred in the first bearing. The IMS dataset is investigated to ensure that the investigated models and proposed LHIs apply to a dataset with constant operating conditions. This investigation ensures that the results obtained are compared to state-of-the-art methods in the literature. By ensuring that our analysis methodology is appropriate, competitive performance results are obtained using vastly different LVM methods.</p><p>To develop the training and validation datasets for model optimisation, the first 10% (98 records) of the available data were assumed to be healthy data. The processing and model optimisation strategy used for the Gearbox dataset in Section 3.2 was followed, and the temporal preservation approach was employed during the development of the HI and LHI signals during model evaluation. The authors chose to investigate two model window lengths as L w = 512 ≤ Fs fs = 20480 33.3 = 615.02 ≤ L w = 4096 bound the implicit window ratio Fs fs . This dataset will demonstrate how simple HI and LHI signal statistics can be used for novelty detection. The HI and LHI signal statistic used for condition inference is the signal mean. To detect a condition deviance point, a condition threshold was determined using the median μ and standard deviation σ of the HI and LHI signal means that correspond to the time-series data used for model training, and this threshold is given as thres = μ±6σ. This approach was chosen to ensure result comparison consistency and comparison flexibility as the threshold is conservative by design. This selection is not integral to the proposed framework, however, to ensure that the healthy data satisfies the Gaussian distribution assumption for the threshold, the authors performed a hypothesis test analysis using the D'Agostino k-squared test <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, Anderson-Darling test <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and Shapiro-Wilk test <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>(a) Record histogram -HI (1) .</p><p>(b) Record histogram -LHI (1) .</p><p>(c) Record histogram -LHI (2) .</p><p>(d) Record histogram -LHI (3)   Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">18</ref>: The record histogram for the T SA of the HI (1) and LHI (1-3) responses for the V AE These tests validated the Gaussian assumption. An example of the test results is given in Appendix B. To detect a change in condition, the mean of the five succeeding points is used. If this mean is greater than the threshold, the record is 500 identified as a deviance point. As the model performance has been adequately demonstrated in Section 3.2, a single set of results is shown to the reader in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">20</ref>.

Notice the presence of four bearings with two accelerometers per bearing.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">20</ref>, it is clear that the linear PCA LVM is able to sufficiently capture and describe the data. While the reconstruction HI appears to detect damage late, the proposed LHIs all detect damage earlier than the reconstruction HI.</p><p>The PCA model's performance indicates that this dataset is simple to capture, as a linear LVM can sufficiently capture the healthy data distribution and the HIs and LHIs are sensitive to anomalous instances. To quantify whether the deviations are due to the development of a fault, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">21</ref> was developed by taking the discrete Fourier transform of each HI and LHI signal. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">21</ref>(a), the HI (1) record-frequency plot is shown, and in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">21</ref>(b) the frequency content at the known BPFO component through time is tracked from each available HI and LHI from the PCA model. This result indicates that the fault development can now be connected to an outer race fault, highlighting how the temporal preservation approach bridges techniques between signal processing and deep learning to enhance the condition inference procedure.</p><p>In the analysis of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, it is clear that the results from signal processing literature appear more consistent in identifying a condition deviance point around record 533. This is also attributed to the current focus of deep learning literature, which is often concerned with semi-supervised learning or transfer learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Signal processing methodologies often require more effort to design a suitable framework. Most supervised learning or semi-supervised learning methods used in the literature require historical fault data that is non-trivial to obtain in practice. The use of LVMs as a novelty detection methodology can overcome both these issues, and the performance of the LVMs shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> indicates that the temporal preservation approach is a suitable model evaluation process that deep learning models should consider when being applied as a novelty detection mechanism. The performance of the PCA model also indicates the benefit of considering different classes of LVMs for learning-based condition monitoring techniques, as this model requires minimal computational resources and has noticeable benefits in its ease of implementation.</p><p>When the results detailed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> are compared to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, the performance obtained from the considered LVMs is on par with the current state-of-the-art techniques from both learning-based literature and signal processing literature.</p><p>Interestingly, in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the effect of a larger model window length appears to hinder the nonlinear models, with worsened performance in the HI (1) indicators when compared to their shorter window length alternative. This is attributed to the signal information present in segments from larger window length models and the relationship to model parametric flexibility, where more flexible models may over-fit slightly to the training data. The LHI (2) performance appears to weaken for models of larger window length to the point where, for some models, a response is obtained that is not indicative of any damage, as indicated by   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion and recommendations</head><p>In this work, a temporal preservation approach and a set of model agnostic LHIs are proposed and evaluated on 535 experimental data consisting of stationary and time-varying operating conditions. This work highlights the requirement to improve the procedures to analyse LVMs before an optimal model is proposed. This contribution contrasts current techniques, whereby the focus is placed on how time-series data is analysed rather than on improving the training or the LVM. The use of various LVMs, trained only on raw time-series asset data in a healthy condition, as a condition monitoring technique is explored, and the responses from the data space and latent space are investigated. It is shown that both 540 components of the model are indicative of damage. However, the temporal structure of the data must be retained to detect anomalous instances in the latent manifold. The detection of anomalous instances in the latent manifold improves model interpretability and allows for physical intuition to be built into the model by investigating the dynamics of time-series    <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Classification data as it traverses through the latent space. The benefit of using LVMs to capture the asset's healthy state allows one to bypass the requirement for extensive expert knowledge and any labelled failure data. This naturally overcomes the 545 limitations of supervised learning methodologies that have been developed for condition monitoring. The benefit of the temporal preservation approach is the ability to treat the HI or LHI signal as a processed representation of the original time-series signal, which can then be further analysed using simple signal statistics or using signal processing techniques.</p><p>This result introduces a natural unification between the two fields. It allows for improved condition inference as the type </p></div>

This will allow the generative distribution to capture more complex data distributions and allow the latent manifold to be explored and interpreted for condition inference purposes. Furthermore, alternative techniques such as normalising and auto-regressive flows can be investigated to determine whether the ability to evaluate p(x) exactly is beneficial over generative likelihood HIs. Additionally, as the flows are designed to be invertible, it is expected that the LHIs proposed in this work can be readily applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Network architectures and parameters</head><p>In this work, Pytorch was used to optimise and train the models <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The system used to train and evaluate the models had an Intel i7-8750H processor and a Geforce RTX 2070 graphics card. The decision was made to generalise the network architecture design based on the window length L w to simplify the model development process for consistent network design referencing. A fixed stride and kernel size was defined for any network that used a convolutional layer, with the padding used to ensure that equal feature map division could be found from one layer to the next. The convolutional layer design used in this work consists of: L stride = 4, L kernel = 32, L padding = L kernel -L stride 2 = 14. Under these properties, the network convolutional or de-convolutional layer input size is enforced to undergo a reduction or expansion of a factor of four. A fully connected layer of size of L F C1 = 800 is connected at the intermediary level to move from a convolutional layer. A second fully connected layer transitions to the latent space dimensionality or to a single node in a discriminator For the latent critic D ω (z n ) used in this work, a simple three-layer fully connected network is used where the dimensionality follows the process: R zn → R 3000 → R 3000 → R 1 . In Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, the relevant activation functions for the different model components are given. In Tables <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref>, the latent dimensionality and hyper-parameters used for each dataset are 575 given. To train the models in this work, the Adam and AdamW methods were used for the VAE and DLS-GAN methods, respectively, with parameters β 1 = 0.6, β 2 = 0.999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Instance noise was also used for the first three thousand epochs of the DLS-GAN training <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.   DLS-GAN Z latent = R [10,10,150] Z latent = R [10,10,128]   Appendix B.
