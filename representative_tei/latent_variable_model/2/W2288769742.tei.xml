<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical approach to testing hypotheses about the relationships among observed and latent variables. Observed variables also called indicator variables or manifest variables. Latent variables also denoted as unobserved variables or factors. Examples of latent variables in education are math ability and intelligence and in psychology are depression and self confidence. The latent variables cannot be measured directly. Researchers must define the latent variable in terms of observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Khine, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>At present, most statistical theory and computer software in the field of SEMs are based on models that involve only linear relationships among the manifest and the latent variables. More statistically sound methods for linear and nonlinear SEMs and factor analysis have been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee and Song (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee and Song (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee (2006)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee and Tang (2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(, Cai et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">( , Lee et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee et al. (2010)</ref>, respectively. We used the Bayesian approach to develop methods for statistical inference. MCMC methods, such as the Gibbs Sampler )Geman and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Geman, 1984</ref>( is used in this paper. Theoretically, in the light of the extension of simple linear regression to multiple regression and nonlinear regression, the importance of generalizing linear structural equation models to nonlinear models that include nonlinear terms of the latent variables is obvious. Practically, nonlinear relationships such as quadratic and interaction terms among the variables are important in establishing the substantive theory in many areas. The rapid growth of SEMs is due to the demand of subtle models and the related statistical methods for solving complex research problems in various fields.</p><p>The main objective of this paper is to propose a Bayesian approach for analysing linear and nonlinear SEMs with ordered categorical variables. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Spiegelhalter et al., 2002)</ref> will be used for model comparison.</p><p>The main idea is to handle the ordered categorical variables in the Bayesian analysis and to treat the underlying latent continuous measurements as hypothetical missing data and augment them with the observed data in the posterior analysis.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Model Description is described in section 2. Bayesian estimation of structural equation models which contain Linear and nonlinear models are described in Section 3. Models comparison using (DIC) are described Section 4. A case study is presented in section 5. Empirical results, which are obtained from a case study, are discussed in Section 6. Some concluding remarks are given in section 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Bayesian estimation of structural Equation models</head><p>The objective of this section is to describe a Bayesian approach for analyzing the preceding nonlinear structural equation models in the context of ordered categorical data. Nice features of a Bayesian approach include the following: (a) Prior knowledge can be directly incorporated in the analysis. As a result, more accurate parameter estimates can be obtained under situations with good prior information; (b) As mentioned by many articles on Bayesian analysis of structural equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lee, 2006</ref> </p><p>The  depends on the sample size, whereas () p  does not. For large samples, the prior of  plays a less important role, and the posterior density function ( | Z) p  is close to the likelihood function () p  . Thus, the Bayesian and ML approaches are asymptotically equivalent, and the Bayesian estimates have the same optimal asymptotical properties as the ML estimates. However, () p  plays a significant role in the Bayesian approach in the situations where the sample size is small, or the information given by ordered categorical data Z.</p><p>In this article, we define the Bayesian estimate of  as the mean of the posterior distribution (called the posterior mean). For simple structural equation models, the posterior mean can be obtained through direct integration. However, due to the complexity of the proposed nonlinear structural equation model with covariates and dichotomous variables, the relating integral does not have a closed form. We apply some MCMC methods in statistical computing to solve this problem.

In general Bayesian analyses, the conjugate prior distributions have been found to be flexible and convenient <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Broemeling, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>This kind of prior distribution has been widely applied to many Bayesian analyses in structural equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lee and Song, 2004 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Song and Lee, 2007)</ref>.

In general, prior information can be obtained from causal observation or theoretical consideration of experts, or the analyses of past data. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kass and Raftery (1995)</ref> , priors are often picked for convenience when there is a lack of accurate prior knowledge, because the effect of the priors in Bayesian estimation is small when the sample size is fairly large. For completeness, the conditional posterior distributions of , Y  and the components of based on the conjugate prior distributions. These results are useful for writing the computer program to implement the Gibbs sampler.</p><p>In the Bayesian approach, we need to evaluate the posterior distribution [ , , ] Z</p></div>

To capture its characteristics, we will try to draw a sufficiently large number of observations from it such that the empirical distribution of the generated observations is a close approximation to the true distribution. A good candidate for simulating observations from the posterior distribution is the Gibbs sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Geman and Geman, 1984)</ref>, which iteratively simulates ,  and  from the full conditional distributions. However, owing to the presence of the ordered categorical variables, these conditional distributions are rather complicated to derive and simulating observations from them is difficult.

The Bayesian estimates of the unknown parameters and the Bayesian model selection statistic DIC are obtained using recently developed powerful tools in statistical computing. All the computational work can be accomplished via the recently developed and freely available software OpenBUGS. Therefore, our proposed method can be conveniently applied on real data. The purpose of this analysis is to compare between linear and nonlinear Bayesian SEMs with ordered categorical data.</p><p>There are some limitations of the current analysis. First, due to the design of questionnaires and the nature of the problems in behavioral, educational, medical and social sciences, data are often in ordered categorical variables with observations in discrete form. In analyzing ordered categorical data, the basic assumption in SEM is that the data comes from a continuous normal distribution which is clearly violated, and rigorous analysis that takes into account the ordered categorical nature is necessary.</p><p>Hence, Clearly, routinely treating ordered categorical variables as normal may lead to erroneous conclusions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lee et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Olsson, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>A better approach for assessing this kind of discrete data is to treat them as observations obtained from a hidden continuous normal distribution with a threshold specification. Second, the current analysis was conducted under the normality assumption of the observed variables in the model. However, this assumption is likely to be violated. Developing a linear &amp; nonlinear Bayesian approach to relax the normality assumption in NSEMs may represent a future research topic.    The results corresponding to the linear and nonlinear SEM with covariates under Type I and II inputs, we observed that the SD values in linear SEM are smaller than the SD values for the nonlinear SEM with covariates. However, it is expected that the empirical performance would be worse with the nonlinear SEM with covariates.</p><p>The HPD intervals of all the parameters were computed. We observed that the performances of the HPD intervals in linear SEM and covariate are satisfactory for ordered categorical variables. To reveal the performance of DIC for model comparison, we reanalysed the data sets via a nonlinear SEM and covariate in the structural equation (Model 5). The DIC values obtained were compared to those obtained under the correct model. Results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">3</ref>.</p><p>The model fitting DIC in linear SEM is less than the DIC value in nonlinear SEM in the ordered categorical variables. As a result, we observed the performance of DIC is not satisfactory and would be worse under nonlinear effect and ordered categorical variables. However, it performs very well with linear effect with covariate and ordered categorical variables.</p><p>Convergence of the Gibbs sampler are monitored by the plots of several simulated sequences of the individual parameters with different starting values and are presented in Figures <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref> respectively. Bayesian estimates were obtained from T=10000 iterations after discarding 5000 burn-in iterations in linear and nonlinear SEMs with covariates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>The Bayesian linear and nonlinear SEMs which involving covariates are very common in social and behavioural sciences. However, in SEM, examples that incorporate nonlinear and covariate terms of latent variables into structural equations exist. As pointed out by Bollen and Paxton (1998), Schumacker and Marcoulides (1998) among others, the lack of applications is not due to the failure of substantive arguments that suggest the presence of nonlinearity, rather the existing statistical methods are technically demanding and not well understood. In this paper, a Bayesian approach is proposed for analysing a linear and nonlinear, covariate models with ordered categorical variables. In addition to point estimation, we provide statistical methods to obtain standard deviation estimates, and model comparisons using the deviance information criterion (DIC). Owing to the complexity of the proposed model, as we have seen, causal relationships among the latent variables and the discrete nature of ordered categorical data manifest variables are alleviated by data augmentation with some MCMC methods. More specifically, the basic idea of our development is inspired by the following common strategy from recent work in statistical computing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rubin, 1991</ref>) that formulate the underlying complicated problem so that when augmenting the real observed data with the hypothetical missing data, the analysis would be relatively easy with the complete data. This strategy is very powerful and can be applied to other more complex models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>z</head><label></label><figDesc>are just used for specifying the categories that contain the corresponding elements in k y</figDesc></figure>
