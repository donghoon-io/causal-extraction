<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As is often the case for concepts in statistics, the term "conditional likelihood" has many meanings. It has, for instance, been used to refer to likelihoods where conditioning is on (1) exogenous explanatory variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gourieroux &amp; Monfort, 1995)</ref>, (2) latent variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aigner et al., 1984)</ref>, (3) the outcome variable, for instance in capture-recapture modeling of population size (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Sanathanan, 1972)</ref> and ascertainment correction in biometrical genetics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pfeiffer et al., 2001)</ref>, (4) previous outcomes, for instance in autoregressive time-series models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Box &amp; Jenkins, 1976)</ref> and peeling in phylogenetics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Felsenstein, 1981)</ref>, (5) order statistics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kalbfleisch, 1978)</ref>, or (6) sufficient statistics.</p><p>In this address we follow the seminal theoretical work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andersen (1970</ref><ref type="bibr">Andersen ( , 1973a) )</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kalbfleisch and Sprott (1970)</ref> and let a conditional likelihood be obtained by conditioning on sufficient statistics for incidental parameters in order to eliminate these parameters. In the context of latent variable or mixed effects modeling, the incidental parameters are the values taken by latent variables for a set of clusters, for example individuals or organizational units. 800 PSYCHOMETRIKA In psychometrics, the canonical use of conditional likelihoods is in measurement relying on the Rasch model <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Rasch, 1960)</ref> and its extensions. As demonstrated by Rasch, estimation of item parameters can in this case be based on a conditional likelihood where the person parameters are eliminated by conditioning on their sufficient statistics. It is often argued that Rasch models and conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation are advantageous in measurement (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fischer, 1995a)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Molenaar (1995)</ref> closes his excellent overview of estimation of Rasch models in the following way: "Unless there are clear reasons for a different decision, the present author would recommend to use CML estimates."</p><p>Conditional likelihoods have been used for a variety of problems in measurement; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fischer (1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">1995c)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Formann (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Maris and Bechger (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Verhelst (2019)</ref>, von <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Davier and Rost (1995)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Zwitser and Maris (2015)</ref> for a small selected sample.</p><p>We are certainly not disputing the utility of CML estimation in measurement. However, we will argue that conditional likelihoods perhaps have a more important role to play in addressing endogeneity problems in psychometrics. Focus will be on cluster-level endogeneity, where covariates and latent variables are dependent, a problem ignored by popular methods which can therefore produce severely inconsistent estimates. Fortunately, CML estimation, an instance of what is referred to as "fixed-effects estimation" in econometrics, can rectify this problem.</p><p>Our plan is as follows. First we introduce some latent variable models and discuss the clusterlevel endogeneity problem whose origins, effects and alleviation we will examine. We proceed to delineate the ideas of protective and mitigating estimation of target parameters before describing the incidental parameter problem of joint maximum likelihood (JML) estimation. Two approaches that address that problem are discussed: marginal maximum likelihood (MML) and conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation. We demonstrate that CML estimation, in contrast to MML estimation, handles cluster-level endogeneity, and describe an endogeneity-correcting feature of MML estimation for large clusters. The scope of CML estimation is then extended followed by a discussion of MML estimation of augmented models that can accommodate cluster-level endogeneity. Several reasons for cluster-level endogeneity are investigated (unobserved clusterlevel confounding of causal effects, cluster-specific measurement error, retrospective sampling, informative cluster sizes, missing data, and heteroskedasticity) and we show how different estimators perform in these situations. Thereafter, we discuss latent variable scoring before closing the paper with some concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Clustered Data</head><p>We consider data consisting of clusters j ( j = 1, . . . , N ) that contain units i j (i = 1, . . . , n j ). Units are typically exchangeable within clusters in cross-sectional multilevel designs. An example is students i j nested in schools j, where the index i associated with the students within a school is arbitrary.</p><p>Units are non-exchangeable within clusters in two settings: (a) longitudinal designs where i is the chronological sequence number of the time-point when a subject was observed and (b) measurement designs where i is the item (or question) responded to by a subject. In the nonexchangeable case, when i corresponds to the same time-point or item across subjects j, we will refer to i as an "item." The different kinds of clustered data are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Illustration of clustered data for N = 3 clusters and n = 2 units per cluster. Exchangeable units (upper panel) and non-exchangeable units (lower panel).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Latent Variable Model</head><p>We consider generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with canonical link functions (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Rabe-Hesketh &amp; Skrondal, 2009)</ref>. Given the cluster-specific latent variables or random effects ζ j , the model for an outcome y i j is a generalized linear model (GLM) with three components (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Nelder &amp; Wedderburn, 1972</ref>): a linear predictor ν i j , a link function g(μ i j ) = ν i j that links the linear predictor to the conditional expectation μ i j of the outcome, and a conditional outcome distribution from the exponential family.</p><p>For a GLMM, we express the linear predictor as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ν i j = x i j β + v j γ + z i j ζ j ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>• β is a vector of parameters for the unit-specific vector x i j . For exchangeable units β are regression coefficients for unit-specific covariates x i j . For non-exchangeable units β contains a vector of item-specific intercepts and a vector of regression coefficients. Correspondingly, x i j includes an elementary vector (where one of the elements is 1 and the other elements are 0) that picks out the intercept for item i, and item-specific and/or unit-specific covariates. • γ is a vector of parameters for the cluster-specific vector v j . For non-exchangeable units γ are regression coefficients for cluster-specific covariates v j . For exchangeable units γ includes an overall intercept and regression coefficients for the cluster-specific covariates in v j , and v j includes a 1 and cluster-specific covariates. • ζ j is a vector of cluster-specific latent variables or random intercept and possibly random coefficients for the vector z i j of item-specific and/or unit-specific covariates (that are often partly overlapping with x i j )</p><p>The conditional expectation of the outcome, given the covariates and latent variables, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">μ i j ≡ E(y i j |x i j , z i j , v j , ζ j ) = g -1 (ν i j ),</formula><p>and the conditional outcome distribution can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(y i j |x i j , z i j , v j , ζ j ) = exp y i j ν i j -b(ν i j ) φ + c(y i j , φ) , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where φ is the scale or dispersion parameter, and b(•) and c(•) are functions depending on the member of the exponential family. We confine our treatment to three GLMs:</p><p>(i) Normal distribution (where φ = σ 2 ) and identity link for continuous outcomes, p(y i j |x i j , z i j , v j , ζ j ) = (σ √ 2π) -1 exp{-1 2σ 2 (y i j -ν i j ) 2 } and g(μ i j ) = μ i j (ii) Bernoulli distribution and logit link for binary outcomes, p(y i j |x i j , z i j , v j , ζ j ) = μ y i j i j (1 -μ i j ) 1-y i j and g(μ i j ) = log μ i j 1-μ i j (iii) Poisson distribution and log link for counts,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p(y i j |x i j , z i j , v j , ζ j ) = exp[-exp(ν i j )] exp(ν i j ) y i j /y i j ! and g(μ i j ) = log(μ i j )</formula><p>Other members of the exponential family include the gamma and inverse-Gaussian distributions.</p><p>For simplicity we concentrate on a special case of (1) with linear predictor</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ν i j = x i j β + v j γ + ζ j .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Cluster-Level Exogeneity and Endogeneity</head><p>Our focus is on the challenges that arise in estimation of latent variable models when there is cluster-level endogeneity. Before embarking on the challenges we must explicitly define what we mean by this term. Let w j represent all observed covariates for cluster j. We say that there is cluster-level exogeneity if all covariates are independent of the cluster-specific intercepts; w j | ζ j . In contrast, cluster-level endogeneity occurs if at least one covariate in w j is not independent of</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ζ j ; w j | ζ j .</formula><p>The definitions of cluster-level exogeneity and cluster-level endogeneity are represented in the graphs in the left and right panels of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, respectively. This kind of graph, which we find useful and will use throughout, resembles traditional directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) but nodes can represent vectors of random variables here. An arrow between two nodes means that the probability distribution of the node that the arrow points to depends on the value taken by the emanating node. The undirected arc between ζ j and w j in the right panel indicates that there is dependence between ζ j and at least one element of w j .</p><p>When exploring reasons for cluster-level endogeneity in Section 12 we will rather informally rely on the d-separation criterion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Verma &amp; Pearl, 1988)</ref> and the equivalent moralization criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Lauritzen et al., 1990)</ref> to infer cluster-level endogeneity from graphs of latent variable models, assuming "stability" or "faithfulness" to preclude dependence paths cancelling out. Sometimes we will examine likelihood contributions to show how cluster-level endogeneity arises and the consequences. Cluster-level exogeneity (left panel) and cluster-level endogeneity (right panel).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Protective and Mitigating Estimation of Target Parameters</head><p>In this address we will focus on the performance of point estimators under cluster-level endogeneity as the number of clusters N becomes large, whereas the cluster sizes n j are fixed and could be small. A classical goal in statistical modeling is (weak) consistency of estimators for all model parameters as N → ∞. However, this typically requires a correctly specified model, an assumption that we often deem to be naive.</p><p>A less ambitious but more realistic goal is protective estimation which is consistent for target parameters but possibly inconsistent for other parameters <ref type="bibr">(Skrondal &amp; Rabe-Hesketh, 2014)</ref>. Our target parameters throughout will be the subset of coefficients in β corresponding to the unitspecific covariates x i j in (3). These covariates could be time-varying variables in a longitudinal study, characteristics of units i j in a multilevel study, or attributes of items i or item-subject combinations i j in measurement.</p><p>An even less ambitious goal is what we will refer to as mitigating estimation where it is likely (but not guaranteed) that estimation of the target parameters β is less inconsistent than conventional estimation that ignores misspecification. Although mitigation in this sense cannot be formally proved, it can be made plausible by theoretical arguments and based on evidence from simulations. The hope is that "almost consistent" estimators (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Laisney &amp; Lechner, 2003</ref>) can be obtained. In reality, mitigating estimation will sometimes be the most realistic goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Incidental Parameter Problems and Their Solutions</head><p>The distinction between structural parameters and incidental parameters was introduced in a seminal paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Neyman and Scott (1948)</ref>. For linear predictor (3), the structural parameters ϑ include β and γ (and σ 2 if relevant), whereas the ζ j are incidental parameters because their number increases in tandem with the number of clusters N . In econometrics a structural parameter is usually a causal parameter and for this reason <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Lancaster (2000)</ref> used the term "common parameter".</p><p>Let y and w denote all outcomes and covariates for the sample, respectively. Assume that the outcomes y j for the clusters are conditionally independent across clusters and the outcomes y i j for cluster j are conditionally independent, given the covariates and latent variable ζ j . The joint likelihood for the structural parameters ϑ and the latent variables ζ 1 , . . . , ζ N (here treated as unknown parameters) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p(y|w; ϑ, ζ 1 , . . . , ζ N ) = N j=1 n j i=1 p(y i j |w j ; ϑ, ζ j ).</formula><p>(4)</p><p>The incidental parameter problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Neyman &amp; Scott, 1948</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Lancaster, 2000)</ref> refers to the fact that joint maximum likelihood (JML) estimation of both structural and incidental parameters need not be consistent for the structural parameters ϑ as N → ∞ for fixed cluster sizes n j . The problem arises because estimation of each ζ j must often rely on a small number of units n j in the cluster. Viewing the cluster sizes as produced by n j = n × m j , where m j has a mean of 1, the inconsistency in estimating ϑ for the models considered here is of order n -1 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Arellano &amp; Hahn, 2007)</ref>. Note that JML estimation has also been referred to as unconditional maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Wright &amp; Douglas, 1977)</ref> and unconstrained maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">de Leeuw &amp; Verhelst, 1986)</ref> in psychometrics.</p><p>There is no incidental parameter problem when the joint likelihood can be factorized into two components, one just containing structural parameters and the other just incidental parameters. Such likelihood orthogonality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Lancaster, 2000)</ref> occurs for linear predictor (3) with (a) identity link and normal conditional distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Chamberlain, 1980)</ref> and (b) log link and Poisson conditional distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cameron &amp; Trivedi, 1999)</ref>. For these models JML estimation is consistent for β when N → ∞ for fixed n j .</p><p>In general, consistent JML estimation can be achieved under a double-asymptotic scheme where both the number of units per cluster increases n → ∞ and the number of clusters increases N → ∞. In psychometrics, a classical result is that β JML is consistent for the Rasch model in this <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Haberman, 1977)</ref>. Based on simulation evidence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Greene (2004)</ref> observed that β JML appears to be consistent for many latent variable models used in econometrics under double asymptotics. However, appealing to double asymptotics is unconvincing when n is not large.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">case if N n → ∞ (</formula><p>For the simple Rasch model, the inconsistency of JML estimation can be derived and corrected. When n = 2, <ref type="bibr">Andersen (1973a)</ref> showed that plim <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Wright and Douglas (1977)</ref> observed that the finite sample bias is approximately 1 n-1 β and discussed the bias correction n-1 n β JML . <ref type="bibr">Andersen (1980, Theorem 6.1)</ref> stated the same result for inconsistency. For more complex models, methods that reduce inconsistency from order n -1 to n -2 are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Arellano and Hahn (2007)</ref>. For instance, a modified profile likelihood where the incidental parameters ζ j are "profiled out" of the joint likelihood has been used for models with linear predictors such as (3) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bellio and Sartori (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bartolucci et al. (2016)</ref>. This approach can produce mitigating estimation. An approach usually called marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation in psychometrics is the most popular for linear predictor (3). Here, ζ j is treated as a random variable and "integrated out" of the joint likelihood, as proposed in early work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956)</ref>. Note that the statistical literature typically refers to this likelihood as integrated and that their marginal likelihood "transforms away" incidental parameters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kalbfleisch &amp; Sprott, 1970)</ref>. The terms unconditional maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bock &amp; Lieberman, 1970)</ref> and, simply, maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Holland, 1990)</ref> have also been used in psychometrics. Under assumptions including cluster-level exogeneity, MML is consistent for all model parameters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">β JML = 2β as N → ∞, so 1 2 β JML is consistent. For general n,</formula><p>Alternatively, conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation can be used where ζ j is treated as a fixed parameter and "conditioned out" of the joint likelihood. The idea of CML estimation was discussed already by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bartlett (1936</ref><ref type="bibr">Bartlett ( , 1937a))</ref>, the eminent British statistician whose name is associated with factor scores in psychometrics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bartlett, 1937b)</ref>. We will see that CML can yield protective estimation of β under cluster-level endogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Marginal Maximum Likelihood (MML) Estimation</head><p>In marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation the cluster-specific intercept ζ j is treated as a random variable in estimation. The following assumptions are usually made:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">[A.1] Cluster independence: p(y|w, ζ 1 , . . . , ζ N ; ϑ) = N j=1 p(y j |w j , ζ j ; ϑ) [A.2] Conditional unit independence: p(y j |w j , ζ j ; ϑ) = n j</formula><p>i=1 p(y i j |w j , ζ j ; ϑ) <ref type="bibr">[A.3]</ref> Strict exogeneity conditional on the latent variable: p(y i j |w j , ζ j ; ϑ) = p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ; ϑ); i.e., given the latent variable, the outcome for a unit only depends on covariates for that unit <ref type="bibr">[A.4]</ref> Correct conditional distribution: p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ; ϑ) follows ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and (3) <ref type="bibr">[A.5]</ref> Cluster-level exogeneity: p(ζ j |w j ) = p(ζ j ) [A.6] Latent variable normality: p(ζ j ) = φ(ζ j ; 0, ψ); a normal density with zero expectation and variance ψ Using [A.2]-[A.6], the marginal likelihood contribution of cluster j simplifies in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L MML j ≡ p(y j |w j ; ϑ) = ζ j p(y j |w j , ζ j ; ϑ) p(ζ j |w j ) dζ j = ζ j n j i=1 p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ; ϑ) φ(ζ j ; 0, ψ) dζ j ,</formula><p>where we see that ζ j is marginalized over or integrated out of the joint likelihood.</p><p>φ(ζ j ; 0, ψ) can be interpreted as the density of a cluster-specific disturbance in a datagenerating mechanism or as a superpopulation density of clusters in survey sampling. That the ζ j are independently and identically distributed random variables can be motivated by exchangeability of the clusters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Draper, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Using <ref type="bibr">[A.1]</ref>, MML estimation proceeds by maximizing the likelihood L MML = N j=1 L MML j w.r.t. β, γ and ψ (and σ 2 if relevant). If the above assumptions are satisfied, MML estimators are consistent as N → ∞ for fixed n j for all parameters under appropriate regularity conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Butler &amp; Louis, 1997)</ref>. Importantly, standard MML estimation becomes inconsistent, possibly severely, for all link functions when the exogeneity assumptions are violated. As we will see momentarily, inconsistency due to violation of <ref type="bibr">[A.5]</ref> can arise because MML estimation of β exploits both within-cluster and between-cluster information, and the latter can be contaminated by cluster-level endogeneity.</p></div>

First, for identity and log links, <ref type="bibr">[A.4]</ref> can be replaced by the more lenient assumption that μ i j is correctly specified (and the domain of y i j for the assumed exponential family distribution encompasses the domain of the correct distribution). This extends the idea of pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Gourieroux et al., 1984)</ref> to what we may call pseudo marginal maximum likelihood estimation in the latent variable setting.

Analytical integration is trivial for models with conjugate latent variable densities for which L MML can be written in closed form.

Hence, economic theory provides a presumption that ζ j and x i j are dependent in the population. Lancaster concludes that "This point plays absolutely no role in the statistics literature", where ζ j is invariably, and usually implicitly, either assumed to be independent or uncorrelated with random covariates or assumed to not depend on the values taken by fixed covariates.

In a cumulative case-control study (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Rothman et al., 2008, p. 125)</ref>, the researcher samples all cases, π(1) = 1, whereas π(0) is small in order to under-sample controls.</p><p>In choice-based sampling individuals are sampled retrospectively by stratifying on their individual choices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Manski, 1981)</ref>, in which case the marginal distribution of the choices in the selected sample typically differs from the corresponding population distribution. A canonical example is choice of transport mode (such as bus, plane or train) where travelers are interviewed at their chosen mode.</p><p>The anatomy of retrospective sampling of units is depicted in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, where we see that the probability of selecting a unit depends on the outcome of that particular unit. Importantly, the outcomes y j are colliders because they are affected by both ζ j and w j . The elements of s j are descendants of the colliders in y j and conditioning on s j (performing selection) therefore induces cluster-level endogeneity as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> (conditioning is henceforth signalled by placing variables in grey background in the figures). The produced dependence between the "parents" ζ j and w j is due to "moralization" according to the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Lauritzen et al. (1990)</ref>.</p><p>Applications proceed with the logit link</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">logit{ p(y i j = 1|x i j , v j , ζ j )} = α i + x i j β + v j γ + ζ j ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where we temporarily denote the intercept for unit i as α i (no intercepts in β here).</p><p>The model is often estimated by standard MML but the marginal likelihood contribution is misspecified for the selected sample (where we denote the outcome vector as y sel j )</p><p>p(y sel j |s j , w j ) =</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">ζ j i p(y sel i j |S i j = 1, x i j , v j , ζ j ) p(ζ j |s j , w j ) dζ j = ζ j i p(y sel i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ) p(ζ j ) dζ j</formula><p>We see that the correct contribution in the first line differs from the standard marginal likelihood contribution in the second line in two ways: (1) the correct conditional outcome distribution p(y sel i j |S i j = 1, x i j , v j , ζ j ) differs from the naive one p(y sel i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ) and the correct latent variable distribution p(ζ j |s j , w j ) differs from the naive one p(ζ j ). The fact that the correct latent variable distribution becomes p(ζ j |s j , w j ) corresponds to the dependence between ζ j and w j seen in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. As a result, standard MML estimation leads to inconsistent estimation of β, an instance of collider-stratification bias (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Greenland et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that the logit link is preserved in selected samples logit{ p(</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">y sel i j = 1|S i j = 1, x i j , v j , ζ j )} = α sel i + x i j β + v j γ + ζ j ,</formula><p>where α sel i = α i + log[π(1)/π(0)]. It follows that standard CML estimation is protective. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Prentice (1976)</ref> argues that protective estimation of the coefficient β for a binary x i j can alternatively be achieved by CML estimation of a retrospective logit model with cluster-specific effects where x i j is the outcome and β is now the coefficient of y i j . In contrast, MML estimation with an auxiliary model produces inconsistent estimation of the intercepts but protective or mitigating estimation of the coefficients of covariates, depending on whether the auxiliary model is correct or not.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.4.">Informative Cluster Sizes</head><p>It is sometimes plausible that the cluster sizes n j depend on a cluster-specific latent variable ζ j and cluster-specific covariates v j . For example, for a clinical psychologist j, the patient volume n j may depend on his latent skill ζ j and whether he works in a public or private hospital z j . The patient outcomes y j may depend on ζ j , z j , and observed individual patient characteristics x j . This situation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, where c j is included to signify that x j and v j are typically dependent.</p><p>A joint model can be specified for the outcomes y j and cluster size n j , the latter part typically a Poisson model with log link</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">p(y j , n j |x j , v j ) = ζ j p(n j |v j , ζ j ) n j i=1 p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ) p(ζ j ) dζ j .</formula><p>MML estimation of the joint model is consistent if the cluster-size model p(n j |v j , ζ j ) is correctly specified in addition to the outcome model p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j ) and the mixing distribution p(ζ j ).</p><p>Researchers occasionally condition on n j by including it as a covariate in the model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Seaman et al., 2014)</ref>. The standard marginal likelihood contribution in this case is misspecified</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">p(y j |x j , v j , n j ) = ζ j n j i=1 p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j , n j ) p(ζ j |x j , v j , n j ) dζ j = ζ j n j i=1 p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j , n j ) p(ζ j |v j , n j ) dζ j = ζ j n j i=1 p(y i j |x i j , v j , ζ j , n j ) p(ζ j ) dζ j .</formula><p>It is evident from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> that n j is a collider and that conditioning on n j opens a confounding path between ζ j and x j that makes x j cluster-level endogenous. However, also conditioning on v j blocks this path, in which case x j remains cluster-level exogenous, whereas v j becomes clusterlevel endogenous. The latent-variable distribution becomes p(ζ j |v j , n j ) (shown in the second line of the likelihood contribution above), which differs from the assumed p(ζ j ) in naive MML estimation.</p><p>For the identity link, MML estimation is consistent for β under cluster-level exogeneity whatever the distribution of ζ j (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Verbeke &amp; Lesaffre, 1997)</ref>, but this is not the case for other links. Naive MML estimation that includes n j as a covariate therefore gives protective estimation of β for the identity link, but otherwise inconsistent estimation, albeit mildly inconsistent according to simulations. Fortunately, standard CML estimation is protective for β for all canonical links because n j is a cluster-level characteristic. Important advantages of this approach are that we neither need to know about the relevant v j nor specify a correct model for the dependence on n j .</p><p>In practice, the cluster size n j is often ignored in the estimating model. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> we see that conditioning on v j makes n j and x j conditionally independent. This implies that MML estimation for the identity link remains protective for β. For the logit link, the estimator of β for the model that ignores n j has a probability limit that differs from the inconsistent MML estimator for the model where n j is included as a covariate because odds-ratios are not collapsible (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gail et al., 1984)</ref>. It is extremely unlikely that this estimator is consistent. For the log link, the inconsistency is expected to be mild. Fortunately, standard CML estimation remains protective for β for all canonical links. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Neuhaus and McCulloch (2011)</ref> considered a restrictive version of the model in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> where the cluster size just depends on ζ j . Here, there is no collider problem and the correct mixing distribution becomes p(ζ j |n j ). The conclusions reported above for MML and CML estimation persist.</p><p>12.5. Data Missing Not at Random 12.5.1. Outcome-Dependent Missingness Missingness of outcomes that depends on the values taken by the outcomes violates the missing at random assumption (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Seaman et al., 2013)</ref> and is therefore referred to as not missing at random (NMAR).</p><p>In the longitudinal non-exchangeable setting, current-outcome dependent missingness occurs if the probability that an outcome is missing at an occasion i, S i j = 1, depends on the value taken by the outcome for that particular occasion y i j . An example would be when the outcome is a disease symptom that makes it more difficult to visit a clinic for an assessment. The structure of current-outcome dependent missingness is shown in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, which is identical to that previously shown for retrospective sampling of units in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>.</p><p>Conditioning on the selection indicators S i j leads to cluster-level endogeneity, as shown in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, because the S i j are decendants of the colliders y i j . For the non-exchangeable case, it is plausible that the missingness probabilities will differ between units i, π i (y i j ).</p><p>For exchangable units, outcome-dependent missingness only makes sense if the probability that an outcome y i j is missing for a unit, S i j = 1, depends on the value taken by the outcome for that particular unit. In contrast, for longitudinal data we can also consider lag(1) outcomedependent missingness where the probability that an outcome is missing at an occasion, S i j = 1, depends on the previous outcome y i-1, j . Such a process is shown in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> for the case of n = 4. This can occur if an outcome, such as a diagnosis, only affects missingness after having been relayed to the subject. Again, missingness produces cluster-level endogeneity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hausman and Wise (1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Diggle and Kenward (1994)</ref> used MML to estimate joint models where linear predictor (3) with an identity link for the outcome is combined with probit/logit models for current-outcome dependent and current plus lag(1) outcome-dependent missingness, respectively. MML estimation is consistent for all parameters under correct model specification, but this approach has been criticized for relying heavily on unverifiable distributional assumptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Little, 1985)</ref>. Standard MML estimation (ignoring the missingness) suffers from colliderstratification bias and is inconsistent for β. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2014)</ref> obtain several useful results for model (23). For current outcome-dependent missingness, CML estimation is protective for β. MML estimation using an auxiliary model yields protective estimation of β if that model is correct and mitigating estimation otherwise. For lag(1) outcome-dependent missingness, CML estimation stratified on the missingness pattern is protective. If missingness depends on both the current and all lagged outcomes (whether observed or missing), CML estimation is protective only if complete data are analyzed stratified on judiciously chosen values of the sufficient statistic. Note that none of these results hinge on specification of a parametric or model for missingness.</p><p>12.5.2. Latent-Variable and Covariate Dependent Missingness Missingness of outcomes can depend on the latent variable in addition to the covariates and is in this case also not missing at random (NMAR). For example, the probability of visiting a clinic/answering an item could depend on the unobserved frailty/ability ζ j of the subject as well as his observed characteristics w j .</p><p>The structure shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> is similar to that previously discussed for informative clustersizes but here s j could also depend on x j , so conditioning on v j does not block the confounding path to give protective estimation of β.</p><p>Joint modeling can be performed with "shared-parameter" models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Wu &amp; Carroll, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Ten Have et al., 1998)</ref> where the outcome and missingness processes share latent variables in addition to observed covariates. MML estimation is consistent for all parameters if the joint model is correctly specified, but note that such models rely on unverifiable distributional assumptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Little, 1985)</ref>. Standard MML estimation that ignores missingness suffers from colliderstratification bias and is inconsistent. CML estimation is protective for β for identity and log link functions because it can be cast as JML estimation of models with cluster-specific dummy variables.</p><p>For the logit link, Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2014) prove that CML estimation is protective for β, even when missingness also depends on missing outcomes (in addition to the latent variable and covariates). Again, this does not require specification of a parametric or nonparametric missingness model.</p><p>The case where missingness just depends on the latent variable is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>. Here the shape of the latent variable distribution is changed from p(ζ j ) to p(ζ j |s j ) but there is no collider problem. For the identity link, standard MML estimation is now protective for β. In contrast, standard MML estimation of β for the logit link is just mitigating, but with mild inconsistency (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Neuhaus et al., 1992)</ref>. CML estimation remains protective for β.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We have demonstrated that conditional likelihoods have an important role to play in latent variable modeling that extends well beyond Rasch models for measurement. For the class of models considered here, a great advantage of CML estimation is that it can simultaneously handle cluster-level endogeneity problems induced by, for instance, unobserved cluster-level confounding of causal effects, cluster-specific measurement error, retrospective sampling, informative cluster sizes, missing data, and heteroskedasticity.</p><p>Although randomized experimental designs ensure that there is no confounding of treatment effects, there could be cluster-level endogeneity due to, for instance, covariate measurement error and data not missing at random. The famous <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Hausman (1978)</ref> specification test that compares fixed-effect estimates (e.g., from CML estimation) with random-effects estimates (e.g., from MML estimation) is routinely used in the context of model (3). Contrary to common belief, a significant test cannot be interpreted as flagging unobserved confounding because cluster-level endogeneity can arise for a variety of reasons.</p><p>In psychology, split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) is sometimes used for repeated measures designs. The hypothesis test for a within-subject effect is in this case robust against cluster-level endogeneity. However, the focus is traditionally solely on hypothesis testing and not estimation of parameters or effect sizes. A very similar fixed-effects approach known as differencein-differences in economics is popular for estimating effects in natural/quasi experiments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Angrist &amp; Pischke, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Hybrid estimation approaches can be obtained by combining CML with other estimation methods:</p><p>(a) CML and MML (and related) estimation:</p><p>In a Rasch context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Andersen and Madsen (1977)</ref> used CML to estimate item parameters β and subsequently MML to estimate the expectation and variance of a parametric person distribution, given β CML . For a linear mixed model with random slopes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Verbeke et al. (2001)</ref> used a conditional likelihood to eliminate the cluster-specific intercept ζ j (and γ ), and MML or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate β, σ 2 and the covariance matrix of the slopes in ζ j . <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Tibaldi et al. (2007)</ref> combined CML and composite-likelihood estimation of crossed random-effects models with identity and logit links.</p><p>(b) CML and instrumental variables (IV) estimation: For model (3) with identity link, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hausman and Taylor (1981)</ref> proposed a multi-stage estimation approach where CML is used to estimate β (and σ 2 ) followed by IV estimation of γ (and the variance of ζ j ) for given β CML . The instruments are internal in the sense that they are constructed from the covariates x i j and v j in the model. All parameters can be consistently estimated if one can correctly designate which unit-and cluster-specific covariates are cluster-level endogenous. In a panel data setting with identity link, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Lee (2002)</ref> used first differencing to remove cluster-specific intercepts. Subsequently, he used IV methods to estimate β, where various exogeneity assumptions for the i j dictate if covariates at an occasion can serve as internal instruments for covariates at other occasions. (c) CML and Bayes estimation:</p><p>Conditional likelihoods have been used in conjunction with prior distributions for model parameters in Bayesian inference. This was motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Diggle et al. (2000)</ref> to handle retrospective sampling and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lancaster (2004)</ref> to handle unobserved confounding. It is worth pointing out that standard Bayesian inference that ignores cluster-level endogeneity performs similarly to standard MML estimation. (d) Mixed-type ML estimation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Cook and Farewell (1999)</ref> discussed the construction of mixed-type likelihoods where the likelihood contributions are of different types for different clusters. They considered a version of linear predictor (3) with a logit link, where conditional likelihoods were used for small clusters whereas joint likelihoods were used for large clusters.</p><p>An interesting recent development is the use of conditional likelihoods in double-robust estimation. <ref type="bibr">Zetterquist et al. (2019)</ref> consider model (3) with a logit link and a binary treatment x i j of interest. They argue that consistency for the corresponding β can be achieved if at least one of the following approaches is consistent for β: i) CML estimation of β in the prospective model (3) for y i j or ii) CML estimation of β as the coefficient of y i j in a retrospective logit model for x i j with a cluster-specific intercept. One need not know which of the models is correct so there are in this sense two opportunities of getting it right.</p><p>In closing, it is evident that we have drawn on and extended results not just from psychometrics but also from other "ics", such as econometrics, biometrics and statistics, in this address. Unfortunately, progress in psychometrics has been hampered by a paucity of cross-fertilization from the other "ics" -but the opposite is certainly also true! A case in point is the extensive literature on covariate measurement error where the psychometric wheel is regularly reinvented, albeit often in a somewhat square fashion.
