<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Almost 25 years ago <ref type="bibr">Noonan and Wold (1983, p. 283)</ref> observed: "Path analysis with hierarchically structured latent variables within the framework of PLS is at an early stage of development, and research is still under way." Unfortunately, their observation is still a valid one, as applications and research into the use of hierarchical construct models using PLS path modeling are still limited. However, several authors have discussed both the theoretical and empirical contributions hierarchical models can make <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Edwards and Bagozzi 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jarvis et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Law and Wong 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">MacKenzie et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Petter et al. 2007)</ref>, although almost exclusively in the realm of covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM). Components-based SEM, or PLS path modeling, can also be used to estimate hierarchical con-struct models <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lohmöller 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Noonan and Wold 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Petter et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wold 1982)</ref>. In this manuscript we will use PLS path modeling to construct a hierarchical construct model, show an empirical application, and provide guidelines for its use. 2   For our empirical illustration we have chosen the construct of online experiential value, which has recently been advanced as a crucial driver of e-loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kim and Stoel 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Novak et al. 2000)</ref>. When <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mathwick et al. (2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mathwick et al. ( , 2002) )</ref> introduced, developed, and tested their experiential value scale, they referred to an experience-based value concept. Theoretically, their experiential value concept represents a fourth-order, reflective, hierarchical construct model that consists of intrinsic (hedonic) value and extrinsic (utilitarian) value as underlying dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Babin et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Holbrook and Hirschman 1982)</ref>. Although the authors provide conceptual support for this hierarchical model, their empirical study only partially tests it. Therefore, our main objective is to demonstrate that PLS path modeling can be used to estimate the parameters in a fourthorder, reflective, hierarchical construct model using online experiential value as an empirical illustration. This demonstration extends the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mathwick et al. (2001)</ref> by specifying experiential value as a reflective, fourth-order latent variable with hedonic (intrinsic) and utilitarian (extrinsic) value as underlying dimensions at the third-order level. We include the resulting hierarchical model in a structural model assessing its nomological validity. We use this application to demonstrate guidelines for assessing hierarchical models using PLS path modeling. This paper is structured as follows. We first elaborate on the contributions of hierarchical construct modeling. In the next section we will discuss how hierarchical construct models can be estimated using structural equation modeling. Then we provide guidelines to build hierarchical construct models using PLS path modeling. Subsequently, we provide an empirical demonstration of the procedure suggested. We discuss how the guidelines suggested can be extended beyond the scope of our empirical illustration. Moreover, we discuss the implications of our study by focusing on the conditions under which PLS path modeling might be more adequate than covariance-based SEM. Finally, we conclude with the limitations of the paper and suggestions for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Utility of Hierarchical Construct Models</head><p>Hierarchical constructs, or multidimensional constructs, as their discussion and application is often limited to a secondorder hierarchical structure, can be defined as constructs involving more than one dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Jarvis et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Law and Wong 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Law et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">MacKenzie et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Netemeyer et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Petter et al. 2007</ref>). As such, they can be distinguished from unidimensional constructs, which are characterized by a single underlying dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Netemeyer et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The utility of hierarchical construct models is based on a number of theoretical and empirical grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001)</ref>. Proponents of the use of higher-order constructs have argued that they allow for more theoretical parsimony and reduce model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Law et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">MacKenzie et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Edwards (2001)</ref> summarizes this argument as theoretical utility; theory requires general constructs consisting of specific dimensions or facets. This is closely related to the trade-off between accuracy and generalization as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gorsuch (1983)</ref>, who argues that "factors are concerned with narrow areas of generalization where the accuracy is great [whereas] higher-order factors reduce accuracy for an increase in the breadth of generalization" (p. 240). <ref type="bibr">Law et al. (1998, p. 749</ref>) even state that "treating dimensions as a set of individual variables precludes any general conclusion between a multidimensional construct and other constructs."</p><p>Moreover, hierarchical construct models allow matching the level of abstraction for predictor and criterion variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fischer (1980)</ref> refers to this as measure specificity, that is, predictor and criterion (latent) variables should be related to each other on the same level of abstraction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chin and Gopal (1995)</ref> discuss three models, in which the intention to adopt GSS is explained by the belief in GSS adoption. Their first model links the underlying dimensions (relative advantage, ease of use, compatibility, and enjoyment) of belief in GSS adoption directly to intention to adopt GSS, without introducing a higher-order latent variable. The second model is a "molar" model, in which belief in GSS adoption is constructed as a 2 As far as terminology is concerned we will use the definition provided by <ref type="bibr">Bacharach (1989, p. 500)</ref> for constructs and variables: "a construct may be viewed as a broad mental configuration of a given phenomenon, while a variable may be viewed as an operational configuration derived from a construct." Hence, we use the general term hierarchical construct model, while referring to manifest variables and latent variables for the operational configuration. Furthermore, we will use the terms reflective and formative to refer to causal relationship between latent variables and manifest variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Edwards and Bagozzi 2000)</ref> as these are more prevalent in the information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Petter et al. 2007</ref>) and PLS literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005)</ref>. latent variable with formative dimensions, while the third model is a "molecular" model, in which belief toward GSS adoption is constructed as a latent variable with reflective dimensions. Model 2 and Model 3 presented by Chin and Gopal show a fit regarding the level of abstraction, while Model 1 links dimensions directly to a potentially higherorder latent variable.</p><p>The conceptual grounds raised above are complemented by two empirical points: reliability and validity of measures of the multidimensional constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001)</ref>. Typically, as the heterogeneity of the dimensions of the multidimensional construct increases, the internal consistency of the summed dimension scores will eventually be reduced. Moreover, the construct validity of the dimension measures has been questioned, as it contains large amounts of specific and group variance, which are generally treated as error variance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Law et al. 1998</ref>). Finally, proponents of higher-order constructs contend that such constructs exhibit a higher degree of criterion-related validity, especially if they serve as predictors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Edwards (2001)</ref> proposes an integrative analytical framework on the basis of (covariance-based) structural equation modeling (SEM), which allows for the simultaneous inclusion of higher-order (multidimensional) constructs and their dimensions as latent variables. In a structural model, the higher-order constructs may serve as either cause or effect by being embedded in a nomological network. This approach also allows us to derive the (indirect) effects of lower-order constructs, or dimensions, on outcomes of the higher-order construct as the pairwise product of loadings (or weights for formative constructs) and coefficients of the outcomes. Moreover, SEM allows for the explicit specification of the direction of the relationships between manifest variables and latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Edwards and Bagozzi 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of Hierarchical Construct Models</head><p>Essentially, two models of higher-order (multidimensional) constructs can be distinguished on the basis of the directions of the relationship between manifest and latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Law and Wong 1999)</ref>:</p><p>(1) the factor model <ref type="bibr">(Chin and Gopal: molecular</ref>  For the factor model, or reflective construct model, the manifest variables are affected by the latent variable(s) (LV j →MV i ), whereas for the composite model, or the formative construct model, this relationship is reversed (LV j ←MV i ).</p><p>For the reflective construct model, higher-order, or hierarchical, latent variable models can be specified as an alternative to group-factor models, i.e., a latent variable model for which all first-order latent variables are correlated, or a firstorder confirmatory factor analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bollen 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Guinot et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunter and Gerbing 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marsh and Hocevar 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rindskopf and Rose 1988)</ref>. Basically, a hierarchical model imposes an alternative structure on the pattern of correlations (covariances) among lower-order latent variables (or factors) of the group-factor model. As such, the higher-order model represents a restriction of the group-factor model, which allows for correlation of the lower-order latent variables (or factors; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rindskopf and Rose 1988)</ref>. For example, a secondorder model can be specified by the following two equations:</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y i = Λ y A η j + g i (2) η j = Γ A ξ k + ζ j</formula><p>The first equation defines the manifest variables (y i ) in terms of the first-order latent variable (η j ) and an (measurement) error term (g i ); Λ y denotes the first-order latent variable loadings. The second equation defines the first-order factors (η j ) in terms of the second-order latent variables (ξ k ) and a disturbance, or residual, term (measurement error for the firstorder factor; ζ j ); Γ denotes the second-order latent variable loadings. Obviously, this hierarchical model can be extended to higher-order latent variables, such as third-order latent variables (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marsh and Hocevar 1985)</ref>. For a third-or fourth-order model, Equation (2) can be extended as follows:</p><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η j = B A η j + Γ A ξ k + ζ j</formula><p>The term Bη j represents the higher-order latent variables (or related outcomes) from the first to the n th order, except for the highest order latent variable, which is represented by the term Γξ k <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Edwards and Bagozzi 2000)</ref>. Hierarchical construct models can also be specified using formative constructs and/or a mix of formative and reflective measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jarvis et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">MacKenzie et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Petter et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>Hierarchical models using latent variables can be estimated using SEM.

To identify reflective higher-order construct models for each single higher-order factor, there should be at least four lower-order factors. For uncorrelated higher-order factors, there should be at least three lower-order factors; while for correlated higherorder factors, there should be at least two lower-order factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Marsh and Hocevar 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rindskopf and Rose 1988)</ref>. Moreover, at least two manifest variables are desired for lowerorder factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rindskopf and Rose 1988)</ref>. For formative (higher-order) constructs, the restrictions necessary for identification are even more stringent <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bollen and Lennox 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jarvis et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">MacCallum and Browne 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">MacKenzie et al. 2005)</ref>. Edwards provides a detailed overview of the constraints necessary to identify reflective and formative higher-order constructs be it as cause or effect. As the covariance-based SEM approach to estimate higher-order models is not the main focus of this paper interested readers are encouraged to review these sources in more detail.</p><p>Finally, in addition to the mathematical identification, the higher-order model is also susceptible to empirical underidentification <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Chen et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dillon et al.,1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rindskopf 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rindskopf and Rose 1988)</ref>, which can lead to inadmissible solutions and/or nonconvergence, especially because factor correlations might be "very close" to 0 or 1.</p><p>These problems might be avoided entirely with the use of component-based SEM or PLS path modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chin and Newsted 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wold 1985)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fornell and Bookstein (1982)</ref> show that PLS path modeling ensures against improper solutions by the removal of factor indeterminacy; latent variable scores are determinate and can be directly estimated. Furthermore, since the residual covariance structure for the measurement error terms and the disturbance terms is not restricted in PLS path modeling, there are no identification problems for recursive models. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chin and Newsted (1999)</ref> observe that PLS path modeling is generally more suitable for studies in which the objective is prediction, the phenomenon under study is new or changing (i.e., the theoretical framework is not yet fully crystallized), the model is relatively complex (i.e., large number of manifest and latent variables), formative constructs are included in the conceptual framework, and the data used does not satisfy the assumptions of (multivariate) normality, large sample size, and independence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guidelines for Specifying Hierarchical Latent Variable Models Using PLS Path Modeling</head><p>PLS path modeling allows for the conceptualization of a hierarchical model through the repeated use of manifest variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Guinot et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lohmöller 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Noonan and Wold 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wold 1982</ref>). A higherorder latent variable can thus be created by specifying a latent variable that represents all the manifest variables of the underlying lower-order latent variables. For example, if a second-order latent variable consists of four underlying firstorder latent variables, each with three manifest variables, the second-order latent variable can be specified using all ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) manifest variables of the underlying first-order latent variables. Consequently, the manifest variables are used twice: for the first-order latent variable ("primary" loadings) and for the second-order latent variable ("secondary" loadings).</p><p>Having thus specified the outer model (measurement model), the inner model (structural model) accounts for the hierarchical component of the model, as it represents the loadings of the second-order latent variable on the first-order latent variables. This approach can obviously easily be extended to higher-order hierarchical models (see <ref type="bibr">Noonan and Wold 1983)</ref>. As latent variable scores are determinate in PLS path analysis, latent variables scores for lower-order latent variables can be obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005)</ref>, which can subsequently be used as manifest variables for the higher-order latent variables.</p><p>After having discussed the usefulness of PLS in assessing hierarchical latent variable models, we now turn to a practical set of guidelines to construct higher-order latent variables for reflective, hierarchical construct models using PLS path modeling. For instructional purposes, the hierarchical construct model is restricted to the third-order level. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents a four step approach to set up higher-order latent variable models in a reflective, hierarchical construct model using PLS path modeling.</p><p>As a universal fit measure, such as model χ 2 for covariancebased SEM using maximum likelihood estimation and derived fit indices, is not available in PLS path modeling, it lacks an index that allows for a global validation of the model (Chin 3 The third-order latent variables are now constructed by setting up an outer model consisting of the blocks of manifest variables of the second-order latent variables (for LV 3 this means all manifest variables; the dashed lines represent the secondary loadings). The second-order latent variables (LV 21 and LV 22 ) are now related to the third-order variable (LV 3 ) as reflective dimensions. The inner model between the second-order and thirdorder latent variables represents the thirdorder loadings.</p><p>4 Finally, the hierarchical model can now be estimated using PLS path modeling. We obtain estimates for the first-order loadings, second order loadings, and third-order loadings. A nonparametric bootstrapping procedure may be used to obtain standard error and calculate t statistics for inferential purposes.</p><p>1998; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> Although a global goodnessof-fit (GoF) criterion has been proposed for PLS path modeling, it mainly serves a diagnostic purpose and not a formal testing one (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Empirical Illustration</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing the Conceptual Framework</head><p>In our empirical illustration, we use the concept of online experiential value to demonstrate how PLS path modeling can be used to estimate the parameters in a reflective, hierarchical latent variable model. Furthermore, we will embed the hierarchical construct in a nomological network, and relate it to eloyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mathwick et al. (2001)</ref> were the first to introduce, develop, and test a scale of experiential value in an online context. They define online experiential value as "a perceived, relativistic preference for product attributes or service performances arising from interaction within a consumption setting that facilitates or blocks achievement of customer goals or purposes" (p. 53). Moreover, they base their conceptualization of experiential value on <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Holbrook's (1994)</ref> work and distinguish between intrinsic (hedonic) and extrinsic (utilitarian) value components on the one hand and active versus reactive sources of value on the other. With respect to the active and reactive sources of value, Holbrook (p. 43) defines the active dimension as "a manipulation of the environment," such as occurs when people play video games. In the reactive dimension, the consumer mainly acts as a viewer and receiver rather than as an active participant.</p><p>Mathwick et al. also distinguish playfulness, aesthetics, customer return on investment (CROI), and service excellence as sources of value. These second-order concepts in turn comprise several first-order constructs. Playfulness involves enjoyment and escapism, aesthetics is composed of visual appeal and entertainment, and CROI is made up of economic value and efficiency; these authors do not define any firstorder concepts of service excellence.</p><p>The conceptual distinction between utilitarian (extrinsic) and hedonic (intrinsic) value already has been demonstrated by <ref type="bibr">Mathwick et al.</ref> in an online retail setting of women's apparel and housewares. However, their conceptual model is restricted to a hierarchical model at the second-order level. Yet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Novak et al. (2000)</ref> claim that online experiences consist of both experiential and goal-directed aspects and therefore suggest the need to evaluate Web sites according to both hedonic and utilitarian value dimensions. We use Mathwick et al.'s conceptualization to illustrate the assessment of a reflective, fourth-order hierarchical model by using PLS. In line with the proposed guidelines, we assess a model in which hedonic value (reflecting the second-order latent variables aesthetics and playfulness) and utilitarian value (reflecting the second-order latent variables service excellence and CROI) are specified as third-order latent variables and experiential value as a fourth-order latent variable reflecting utilitarian and hedonic value. An overview of the conceptual framework containing the fourth-order conceptual framework is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>To embed online experiential value in a nomological network, we will relate it to e-loyalty. Srinivasan, Anderson, and Ponnavlu ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) define e-loyalty as a favorable attitude toward a Web site that results in repeat visit behavior. This definition reflects the commonly accepted distinction between attitudinal and behavioral aspects of customer (e-)loyalty.</p><p>Attitudinal loyalty includes some extent of preference (affect) and commitment, whereas behavioral loyalty consists of revisit intentions (conation) toward a website (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudhuri and Holbrook 2001)</ref>. Therefore, we test the following hypotheses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H 1a :</formula><p>Online experiential value has a positive impact on attitudinal e-loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H 1b :</head><p>Online experiential value has a positive impact on behavioral e-loyalty.</p><p>As indicated by theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen 1991), consumer attitudes influence behavior. Therefore, we finally test the following hypothesis:</p><p>H 2 : Attitudinal e-loyalty has a positive impact on behavioral e-loyalty.</p><p>We posit that the relationship between online experiential value and behavioral e-loyalty is mediated by attitudinal eloyalty. H 1b denotes the direct effect in the (partial) mediation model and has been included to test for mediation.

To increase the response rate, we raffled off five cash incentives worth $12.50, which resulted in a total of 308 respondents. As a screening question, we asked whether the respondent had ever visited or purchased from an online retailer selling both books and CDs, such as Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com. On the basis of this screening question, 190 respondents remained for further analysis. Next, we asked these remaining respondents to complete the questionnaire about their most frequently visited online book and CD store to evaluate their online experiences.</p><p>Of the participants, 57.6 percent were women; 9.6 percent were younger than 20 years of age, 63.9 percent were between 20 and 25 years, 19.5 percent were between 26 and 30 years, and 7 percent were older than 30 years. Of the total sample population, 73.8 percent considered themselves students, 21.9 percent as being employed, and 4.3 percent as "other." </p></div>

The higher-order latent variables were set up through the repeated use of the manifest variables of the lower-order latent variables. We constructed the reflective, hierarchical construct model in PLS path modeling using the four key steps outlined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>(1) We constructed the first-order latent variables (LV1-LV7) and related them to their respective block of manifest variables using mode A (reflective) in their outer model.</p><p>(2) The second-order latent variables (LV8-LV10) can now be constructed by relating them to the blocks of the underlying first-order latent variables using Mode A (reflective) in their outer model.

The inner model between the secondorder latent variables (LV8-LV10) and the first-order latent variables (LV1-LV7) represents the second-order loadings. LV5 (service excellence) is a first-order latent variable and is hypothesized to be not related to any of the second-order latent variables.</p><p>(3) The third-order latent variables are now constructed by setting up an outer model consisting of the blocks of manifest variables of the second-order latent variables. For LV11 (hedonic value), this means the blocks of LV8 (aesthetics; LV1 and LV2 at the first-order level) and LV9 (playfulness; LV3 and LV4 at the first-order level) are used to set up the outer model using Mode A. For LV12 (utilitarian value), this amounts to the blocks of LV5 (service excellence) and LV10 (customer ROI; LV6 and LV7 at the first-order level). The inner model between the second-order and third-order latent variables represents the third-order loadings. LV13 (experiential value) is constructed by relating it to the blocks of the third-order level latent variables LV11 (hedonic value) and LV12 (utilitarian value). For LV13 this means that an outer model is set up using all of the blocks of the first-order latent variables (LV1-LV7). The inner model between the third-order and fourth-order latent variables represents the fourth-order loadings.</p><p>(4) Finally, the hierarchical model can now be estimated using PLS path modeling. We obtain estimates for the first-order loadings, second-order loadings, third-order loadings, fourth-order loadings, and structural parameters. A nonparametric bootstrapping procedure may be used to obtain standard error and calculate t statistics for inferential purposes.

Similarly, the loadings of the second-order latent variables on the third-order latent variables are equal to or exceed 0.80. Finally, the loading of hedonic value on online experiential value equals 0.93, and the loading of utilitarian value on online experiential value is 0.78, which is in support of the fourth-order model of online experiential value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the Hierarchical Construct in a Structural Model</head><p>To assess the nomological validity of our hierarchical construct model we embedded online experiential value in a nomological network with attitudinal and behavioral eloyalty.

As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Holmbeck (1997)</ref>, we first estimated a model containing only the (direct) effect of online experiential value on behavioral e-loyalty (β = 0.56, p &lt; 0.01; R 2 = 0.31). We can now compare this model to the parameter estimates in our conceptual model. Our results suggest that the impact of the direct effect declines (β = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05) by the inclusion of the indirect effect through the mediator, attitudinal e-loyalty. Using an incremental F test we can test whether including the direct effect of online experiential value on behavioral e-loyalty significantly increases the variance explained for behavioral e-loyalty. Our results suggest a significant impact of the direct effect on the variance explained in behavioral e-loyalty, albeit with a fairly small effect size (ΔR 2 = 0.012, f 2 = 0.02, F 1,187 = 3.99, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we find that the indirect association between online experiential value and behavioral e-loyalty (β indirect = 0.38, z = 5.82, p &lt; 0.001) is greater in magnitude than their direct association (β direct = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baron and Kenny 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">MacKinnon et al. 2002)</ref>. To obtain the standard error for the indirect effect we used the bootstrap method suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Shrout and Bolger (2002)</ref>, which seems to be more appropriate for PLS than <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sobel's (1982)</ref> large sample test. These results provide support for the partially mediating role of attitudinal e-loyalty between online experiential value and behavioral e-loyalty.</p><p>Recently, a global fit measure for PLS path modeling has been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Tenenhaus et al. 2005)</ref>, GoF (0 &lt; GoF &lt; 1), defined as the geometric mean of the average communality and average R 2 (for endogenous constructs). Because communality equals AVE in the PLS path modeling approach, we propose a cut-off value of 0.5 for communality, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. Moreover, in line with the effect sizes for R 2 (small: 0.02; medium: 0.13; large: 0.26) proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen (1988)</ref>, we derive the following GoF criteria for small, medium, and large effect sizes of R 2 by substituting the minimum average AVE of 0.50 and the effect sizes for R 2 in the equation defining GoF</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">; ) * ( 2 R E V A GoF =</formula><p>GoF small =0.1, GoF medium =0.25, and GoF large =0.36.

We use the product of the loading of hedonic and utilitarian value on online experiential value and the coefficient that represents the effect of online experiential value on attitudinal e-loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001)</ref>.</p><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> demonstrates, the indirect effect between hedonic value and attitudinal e-loyalty is 0.93 * 0.75 = 0.70 (z = 18.24, p &lt; 0.001),<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> whereas that between utilitarian value and attitudinal e-loyalty is 0.78 * 0.75 = 0.59 (z = 12.87, p &lt; 0.01). The same procedure can be followed to derive the indirect effect between hedonic and utilitarian value and behavioral e-loyalty. The total effect of hedonic value on behavioral e-loyalty is 0.51 (z = 10.55, p &lt; 0.01), and the total effect of utilitarian value on behavioral e-loyalty is 0.43 (z = 9.13, p &lt; 0.01). Obviously, this approach also works for lower order constructs and formative constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Marcoulides and Saunders (2006, p. viii)</ref> have cautioned IS researchers using PLS path modeling: "PLS is not a silver bullet to be used with samples of any size." Consequently, they have strongly recommended that the power of the study should be assessed and recommended.

These relationships, however, could also be specified as formative (or mode B, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">molar model, Chin and Gopal 1995)</ref> or a mix of formative and reflective relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jarvis et al. 2003)</ref>. In covariance-based SEM, this would require constraints, which would not allow identification for the construct per se, except by adding reflective indicators or relating it to at least two unrelated constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jarvis et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">MacCallum and Browne 1993)</ref>. The latter is rather awkward in a higher-order model and the former is conceptually unappealing.</p><p>The PLS path modeling approach proposed in this paper can also be applied to formative relationships in the higher-order structure. PLS path modeling can also be used for hierarchical models with formative constructs or a mix of formative and reflective constructs. For the first-order level latent variables, this could be accomplished by using mode B instead of mode A. For the higher-order constructs, the direction of the relationships will need to be reversed <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lohmöller 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Noonan and Wold 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wold 1982</ref>). However, this will result in a R 2 value of the higher order construct of unity. This is similar to <ref type="bibr">Diamantopolous and Winklhofer's (2001)</ref> suggestion to set the error term to zero to obtain identification in a covariance-based SEM context.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Implications</head><p>The main objective of this study was to demonstrate that PLS path modeling can be used to assess hierarchical models. We provided an empirical illustration by using data from an online retail setting and develop a detailed set of guidelines for constructing a hierarchical model using PLS path modeling. The application of PLS path modeling to hierarchical construct models makes it possible to extend the theoretical contributions of the original study. Our results provide empirical support for the third-and fourth-order latent variable model. Our empirical study also illustrates that higher order constructs can be incorporated in structural models as we provide empirical evidence of the positive impact of online experiential value on attitudinal and behavioral e-loyalty. The fourth-order reflective hierarchical construct model reveals that online experiential value is an important driver of online attitudinal and behavioral loyalty.</p><p>Covariance-based SEM and components-based SEM, or PLS path modeling, should be regarded as complementary methods. It is the objective of covariance-based SEM to minimize the (maximum likelihood) fitting function between the sample covariance matrix and the (parameter) implied covariance matrix. For PLS path modeling, on the other hand, parameter estimates are obtained to minimizes the residual variance of all dependent variables (manifest and latent variables). However, there might be conditions under which PLS path modeling might outperform covariance-based SEM for assessing hierarchical construct models.</p><p>The identification of reflective hierarchical models using covariance-based SEM is not an easy task. Even if the model per se is theoretically identified, it might still suffer from empirical underidentification, which may cause nonconvergence and/or improper solutions. For formative hierarchical construct models, or hierarchical construct models with a mix of formative and reflective constructs, the challenges might even prove more formidable in that respect. PLS path modeling is not as susceptible to identification problems and improper solutions as covariance-based SEM. As far as hierarchical construct models are concerned, we have provided practical guidelines to construct higher-order latent variables using PLS path modeling. We have demonstrated the use of these guidelines in an empirical illustration of a reflective, fourth-order model embedded in a nomological network. Finally, we have discussed the extension of the guidelines to hierarchical construct models beyond the scope of the empirical illustration.</p><p>Using a Monte Carlo simulation, <ref type="bibr">Cassell et al. (1999)</ref> show that PLS path modeling is quite robust to deviations from normality, except for highly skewed distributions.</p><p>If higher-order constructs are embedded in a nomological network, either as cause or effect, model complexity might be an additional factor in the trade-off between covariance-based SEM and PLS path modeling. Although only used for instructional purposes, neither <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Edwards (2001)</ref> nor <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Law and Wong (1999)</ref> specify a total disaggregation model for their multidimensional constructs, be they reflective or formative, but rely on a first-order partial aggregation model, in which the aggregated mean over the manifest variables of the firstorder latent variables are used as "manifest" variables for the second-order latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bagozzi and Edwards 1999)</ref>, thus potentially confounding the (measurement) error term (at the manifest variable level) and the disturbance, or residual, term (at the latent variable level). Model complexity does not pose as severe a restriction to PLS path modeling as to covariance-based SEM, since PLS path modeling at any moment only estimates a subset of parameters, hence partial least squares. Consequently, PLS path modeling would be more suitable to more complex models including models with hierarchical constructs (with a total disaggregation approach), mediating effects and moderating effects (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chin et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The analysis of formative constructs in covariance-based SEM is not an easy task, as it involves identification rules, which make its application rather difficult, especially for multidimensional or hierarchical models. PLS path modeling generally allows for the easy handling of formative constructs.</p><p>Although the biasing effects of incorrectly specifying formative constructs as reflective are well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jarvis et al. 2003)</ref>, in their review of the IS literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Petter et al. (2007)</ref> report that 30 percent of the constructs are incorrectly specified. In response to this, they have provided a roadmap (p. 642) for IS researchers to identify formative constructs, assessing the validity of the measures and analyzing the model. Although we have focused on a reflective higherorder model in our empirical illustration, we have indicated that our guidelines may be extended to formative constructs.</p><p>A notable example of the use of formative constructs in a multidimensional model is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rai et al. (2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</head><p>Our empirical illustration of the use of PLS path modeling constitutes only a single study with limited generalizability. Therefore, we hope that our exposition and guidelines will assist researchers with future applications of PLS path modeling for hierarchical construct models. It would be useful for future research to compare PLS path modeling versus covariance-based SEM and compare the performance under a number of different conditions (sample size, model complexity, number of manifest variables per latent variables, distributional properties of the manifest variables, the direction of the relationship between manifest and latent variables including potential incorrect specification, missing data, etc.).</p><p>To compare results across contexts, multi-sample analysis is quite frequently used in covariance-based SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Vandenberg and Lance 2000)</ref>. Comparison across contexts or groups might very well contribute to the generalizability of findings. Multi-sample analysis can be applied in PLS path modeling using a t test to compare parameter estimates across samples (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Duxbury and Higgins 1991)</ref>. However, the use of asymptotic (i.e., large sample) tests is not quite adequate for PLS path modeling. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chin and Dibbern (2009)</ref> propose a permutation-based approach to multi-sample analysis in PLS path modeling.</p><p>The main advantage of covariance based SEM over PLS path modeling is the use of formal testing procedures allowing for the assessment of the validity of global model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bollen 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. 2005)</ref>.

For example, the second-order model is nested in the first-order, group factor model. By applying the appropriate restrictions and comparing the model fit, the appropriateness of the restrictions can be assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rindskopf and Rose 1988)</ref>.</p><p>For PLS path modeling this approach is unfortunately not possible, and consequently the validity of the model cannot be globally assessed in PLS path modeling. The GoF proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tenenhaus et al. (2005)</ref> mainly serves a diagnostic value and cannot be employed in that respect. However, the application of the Schmid-Leiman solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Schmid and Leiman 1957</ref>) might provide useful diagnostic information. The Schmid-Leiman solution allows us to assess the variance explained by the different levels of latent variables in our hierarchical model. Applying the Schmid-Leiman solution to our empirical illustration, we find that almost 70 percent of the variance explained can be attributed to the higher-order factors (second-order and upward; Wolf and Preising 2005).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> Unfortunately, this approach only applies to reflective hierarchical construct models.</p><p>We modeled hierarchical construct models by repeated use of manifest variables. However, as latent variable scores are determinate in PLS path modeling, we could also conceive of an approach in which latent variable scores are obtained for the lower-order latent variables in a sequential fashion and used as manifest variables for the higher-order latent variables. We would need to explore how this sequential latent variable score method compares to the repeated use of manifest variables. Furthermore, we would need to assess the underlying assumptions and guidelines for the use of this approach.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> </p><p>The use of actual data sets should be complemented by Monte Carlo simulations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Paxton et al. 2001)</ref>. Monte Carlo simulations might prove an interesting tool to explore the impact of improper solutions in covariance-based SEM for hierarchical models and the potential for PLS path modeling to serve as a remedy to this problem. A Monte Carlo simulation would allow us to compare the performance of covariance-based SEM versus PLS path modeling for hierarchical construct models. It would be interesting to contrast the performance of covariance-based SEM with the repeated use of manifest indicators approach and the latent variable score approach in PLS path modeling. For the Monte Carlo simulations, we would need to assess convergence, the accuracy of the parameter estimates, statistical power, and model fit of hierarchical construct models under a number of different conditions, such as the number of levels in the hierarchical model, the number of manifest and/or latent variables (model complexity), the number of manifest variables per latent variable, distributional properties of the manifest variables, measurement levels of the manifest variables, the use of reflective or formative constructs, the reliability of measures, and missing data patterns. EQS 6.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bentler 2004</ref>) might be very useful to conduct these Monte Carlo simulations, as it applies restrictions to parameter estimates to avoid improper solutions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Paxton et al. 2001)</ref>. Furthermore, EQS 6.1 provides an overview of the number of simulations that successfully converge and indicates the condition code if simulations do not successfully converge. This might provide important diagnostic information in the case of hierarchical construct models. Finally, EQS 6.1 allows for the generation of non-normal data, the inclusion of contamination effects, the application of nonparametric bootstraps and the use of missing data patterns.</p><p>and Wynne Chin, for their constructive and encouraging comments.
