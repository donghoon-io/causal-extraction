Advances in the automated collection and coding of events have produced massive and systematized data sets of micro-records that enable data-driven The The Goldstein scale is an expert-based intensity ranking of the 20 CAMEO action categories ranging between -10.0 (conflictual) to +10.0 (cooperative). The scale disregards casualty counts that are typically considered in conflict assessment. Here, we display casualty counts as reported in the NAVCO dataset.</p><p>approaches to monitoring conflict. While the "intensity" of a given event has traditionally been assessed by human expert raters, the tremendous quantity of events collected every day makes caseby-case analysis unmanageable. As a consequence, there is a strong demand for automated and modelbased methods to aggregate events into meaningful "conflict intensity" measures.</p><p>One of the most frequently used measures is the Goldstein scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goldstein, 1992)</ref>. Major event datasets like IDEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bond et al., 2003)</ref>, KEDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schrodt, 2008)</ref>, GDELT <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leetaru and Schrodt, 2013)</ref>, ICEWS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boschee et al., 2015)</ref>, Phoenix <ref type="bibr">(Beieler, 2016)</ref> and NAVCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lewis et al., 2016)</ref> all rely on it. The Goldstein scale assigns intensity scores between -10.0 and +10 on a conflictual-cooperative scale to the action categories defined by the Conflict and Mediation Event Observations (CAMEO) event coding scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schrodt, 2012)</ref>. CAMEO specifies 204 low-level event types which are summarized into 20 high-level action categories. The Goldstein scale ranks "use unconventional mass violence" and "fight" as the most conflictual of the 20 highlevel action categories (-10.0) and "provide aid" (+7.0) as the most cooperative; see Tab. 1.</p><p>Despite its usage, the Goldstein scale has many well-known shortcomings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(King and Lowe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schrodt, 2019)</ref>. In particular, it applies only to action categories, and does not account for any contextual information of a given event, like which actors are involved, or how many fatalities resulted, among other bits of context that should contribute to the perception of an event's "intensity".</p><p>This paper takes a latent-variable based approach to measuring conflict intensity. We introduce a probabilistic generative model that assumes each observed event n is associated with a latent intensity class z n . A novel aspect of this model is that it imposes an ordering on the classes, such that higher values of z n denote higher levels of intensity. The ordinal nature of z n is induced from naturally ordered aspects of the data (e.g., casualty counts) where higher values naturally indicate higher intensity. The model effectively learns to interpolate the ordered (i.e., cardinal or ordinal) elements of the data while inferring correlation structure with the non-ordered (e.g., categorical) elements of the data (e.g., actor types).</p><p>We start with a discussion of the Goldstein scale and introduce a political event dataset annotated with Goldstein values in §2 and §3. Then, we propose our model with an ordinal latent variable in §4. We evaluate the performance of the model intrinsically ( §5) and extrinsically ( §6) and find that it improves over measures based on the original Goldstein scale or heuristics based on the raw data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Limitations of the Goldstein Scale</head><p>The Goldstein scale is a widely-used measure of the conflictual versus cooperative nature of interactions between countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goldstein, 1992)</ref>. The scale was created by a panel of international relations experts who ranked descriptions of interactions. It was initially created to score action categories in the WEIS event ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(McClelland, 1984)</ref> and was later adapted to CAMEO <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schrodt, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The Goldstein scale applies only to the action category of an event (e.g., "fight" or "trade"). Thus, two different "fight" events, which might involve two different pairs of actors, occur at different times, or differ dramatically with respect to the number of associated fatalities, will still be assigned the same Goldstein value.The Goldstein scale is thus a poor measure of a conflict's perceived "intensity", as it ignores much of the information that contributes to that perception. Recent work in conflict studies, for instance, operationalizes "intensity" primarily using casualty counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chaudoin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhong et al., 2023)</ref>, which the Goldstein scale ignores entirely.</p><p>In Tab. 1, we show the empirical distribution of assigned Goldstein values alongside the empirical distribution of casualty counts in a dataset of conflict events. The Goldstein scale is very coarsegrained; while it ostensibly ranges between -10.0 and +10.0, only a small number of discrete values ever occur, with many action categories assigned the same value. For the purpose of measuring conflict intensity, a finer-grained and more contextual scale is desirable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conflict Event Data</head><p>This paper considers the publicly available Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chenoweth et al., 2018)</ref>, specifically, the latest release NAVCO 3.0 from November 2019 which comprises N = 112,089 events between December 1990 and December 2012. An exemplary event description is "On 19 May 2012, soldiers injured two civilians in Afghanistan". Each part of this description has been parsed by human coders into standardized, structural features. We color-code the features that correspond to the semantic roles subject, predicate, quantifier, object, which are the focus of our modeling approach. Each data point n thus consists of a four-element tuple {s n , p n , q n , o n }. We note that events are further coded for their location (in this case, Afghanistan) and time (19 May 2012), among other bits of contextual information. Let us discuss each feature in more detail: Subject s n . NAVCO contains columns termed "actor3", "actor6" and "actor9" which code for the subject (or agent) of a given action. The actor types are defined by the CAMEO actor codebook. We first merge the higher-level categories "actor3" and "actor6", resulting in 33 different actor types, and  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chenoweth et al., 2018)</ref>. Goldstein values and casualty counts have intrinsic intensity orderings. Goldstein values are reversed and transformed, so that 1.0 represents the most conflictual. We model the subject s n as Categorical, the predicate p n as Beta, the quantifier q n as Zero-inflated Geometric and the object o n as Categorical.</p><p>then map all actor types into one of S = 4 classes: s n ∈ {civilian, military, governmental, political}. We present our 4-class actor type mapping in Tab. 3 of the appendix.</p><p>Predicate p n (Goldstein values). NAVCO codes 1 each event description into one of the 20 CAMEO action categories in the column "verb10", which is by extension associated with a Goldstein value p n . Throughout, we refer to the Goldstein value p n as an action's "predicate", since there is a one-to-one mapping between action categories and Goldstein values. We scale Goldstein values p n to a [0, 1] range and invert them (i.e., p n ← 1p n ) so that higher values close to 1 represent more conflictual action categories.</p><p>Quantifier q n (casualty counts). Each event description is annotated with human-verified fatality and wounded counts. We add the two and 1 NAVCO features a 21 st action category which we exclude since it is not specified by the CAMEO taxonomy and thus has no Goldstein value. refer to the resulting value q n ∈ N + 0 as an event's "quantifier" or its "casualty count". In Tab. 1, we give the average number of casualties associated with each action alongside its Goldstein value-as intuition might suggest, actions that Goldstein scores as more conflictual (e.g., "fight" (-10.0)) coincide with more casualties on average.</p><p>Object o n . Similar to its subject, NAVCO codes for the direct object or "target" of a conflict action using the CAMEO coding scheme; these codes are found in the columns "target3" and "target6". We map those into the O = 4 classes so that o n ∈ {civilian, military, governmental, political}.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Ordinal Latent Variable Model</head><p>We operationalize conflict intensity as a latent variable that expresses the association between the observed variables subject (s n ), predicate (p n ), quantifier (q n ) and object (o n ). Each data point is a tuple {s n , p n , q n , o n } representing an event. Our Bayesian latent variable model is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We assume the following generative story.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Ordinal Latent Variable</head><p>We want the latent variable z n to be ordinal, such that higher-valued classes correspond to higher intensity levels. However, in the model thus described, z n is a Categorical random variable whose classes are not inherently ordered. So how does this model encode an ordinal z n ?Unlike the subject s n and object o n , which are categorical, the Goldstein value p n and casualty count q n are cardinal quantities whose magnitudes naturally indicate the "intensity" of a given event. To capture this intuition, we first assume that p n and q n are drawn from Beta (eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)) and Zero-inflated Geometric distributions (eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)), respectively, whose parameters are indexed by z n . We then impose an ordering on the parameters, such that higher classes (e.g., z n = c) correspond to higher-valued parameters (e.g., ω</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(p) c &gt; ω (p)</formula><p>c-1 ) which in turn encourage larger values of the observed cardinal quantities (e.g., p n ). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>Ordered Normal To flexibly impose ordering on vectors of parameters, we first define the Ordered Normal prior <ref type="bibr">(Stoehr et al., 2023a</ref>). An ordered vector λ = (λ 1 , . . . , λ C ), where λ c &gt; λ c-1 , is a Cdimensional Ordered Normal random variable λ ∼ OrderedNormal C (µ, σ) if it is sampled according to the following generative process:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">x c iid ∼ Normal(µ, σ) for c ∈ {1, . . . , C} (λ 1 , . . . , λ C ) ← Ord({x 1 , . . . , x C }) (7)</formula><p>where Ord(•) takes in an unordered set of numbers {x 1 , . . . , x C }, and transforms it into a vector whose components are in strictly increasing order,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">λ c ← x 1 if c = 1 x 1 + c i=2 exp(x i ) if c &gt; 1 (8)</formula><p>This transformation is invertible and differentiable and thus does not obstruct gradient-based inference of model parameters (App. B).</p><p>Ordered Beta. We model Goldstein values p n as Beta random variables. For intensity class z n = c, we assume p n ∼ Beta(ω</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(p) c , κ<label>(p)</label></formula><p>c ), where ω (p) c ∈ (0, 1) is the mode and κ (p) c &gt; 0 is the concentration parameter. We impose an ordering on the modes by positing a transformed OrderedNormal prior:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">S -1 (ω (p) ) ∼ OrderedNormal C (µ, σ) (9)</formula><p>where ω (p) = (ω</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(p) 1 , . . . , ω (p)</formula><p>C ) is the Cdimensional ordered vector of modes and S -1 (•) is the element-wise inverse sigmoid function. To ensure that each class-conditional Beta distribution is unimodal around its mode ω (p) c , we then mandate that the concentration parameter κ (p) c is greater than 2 by imposing a shifted Gamma prior.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(κ (p) c -2) iid. ∼ Gamma(k, η)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where k and η are the shape and rate parameters. We note that while the elements of ω (p) are ordered, those of κ (p) are not.</p><p>Ordered Zero-inflated Geometric. We model the casualty counts q n as Zero-inflated Geometric random variables. For intensity class z n = c, we assume q n ∼ Zero-infl. Geom.(δ</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(q) c , b<label>(q)</label></formula><p>c ) where δ (q) c ∈ (0, 1) is the "gate" parameter-i.e., the inflated probability of sampling a zero-and b (q) c ∈ ered more "intense" than one with military casualties). In this work, however, we focus just on learning scales from observations that are naturally cardinal.  (0, 1) is the success probability parameter under the standard Geometric distribution. We impose an ordering on both C-dimensional vectors of parameters δ (q) and b (q) using the same transformed Ordered Normal prior as in the previous subsection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">S -1 (δ (q) ) ∼ OrderedNormal C (µ, σ) (11) S -1 (b (q) ) ∼ OrderedNormal C (µ, σ) (12)</formula><p>Importantly though, we reverse the ordering of λ such that for all c ∈ {1, . . . , C} : λ c &lt; λ c-1 . The reason is that higher δ (q) c and b (q) c correspond, on average, to lower values sampled from the Zeroinflated Geometric and thus lower casualty counts and lower event intensity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Posterior Inference</head><p>We implement the model using the probabilistic programming framework Pyro <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bingham et al., 2018)</ref>. Pyro provides an OrderedTransform function that implements eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>). We approximate the posterior distribution of our model's parameters using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Homan and Gelman, 2014)</ref>, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. NUTS is gradient-based and requires the parameters to be continuous. However, we explicitly model our latent variable z n to be ordinal. To solve this problem, Pyro provides parallel_enumeration which marginalizes out discrete variables numerically during inference.</p><p>We refer to all continuous parameters of our model as θ = {π (z) , Π (s) , ω (p) , κ (p) , δ (q) , b (q) , Π (o) } and to the full dataset of event tuples as X. NUTS produces samples of θ from the posterior θ (t) ∼ p(θ | X). We can further sample the ordinal latent z Label Switching. It is typically not meaningful to compute zn for mixture and admixture models due to the problem of label switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Stephens, 2000)</ref>, where the labels of the latent classes may switch between Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. However, in the proposed model, the ordering transformation presented in eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) represents an identifiability constraint that fixes the meaning of z n = c-i.e., c is the class that is more intense than c -1 and less intense than c + 1. This alleviates the problem of label switching, and permits us to meaningfully average posterior samples z (t) n . Practical Details. Our model has 13 × C trainable parameters, where C is the number of latent classes. When fit to the full dataset introduced in §3, our implementation generates 1,000 posterior samples, for C = 5, on a CPU with 64 GB of RAM in less than 10 minutes. Throughout we set hyperparameters to uninformative values: µ = -1.0, σ = 1.0, k = 1.0 and η = 1.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Intrinsic Evaluation: Imputation</head><p>To evaluate the fit of our model, we conduct a series of predictive experiments. We randomly split the N = 112,089 events into a 70% training and 30% held-out set. We fit the model on the training set X and approximate the posterior distribution of continuous parameters θ based on T = 1,000 NUTS samples after discarding the first 200 burn-in samples. For evaluation on the held-out set Y , we report scaled pointwise predictive density (SPPD), mean squared error and weighted F1 score as detailed in App. A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Number of Latent Classes C</head><p>The number of classes C that our latent variable z n ranges over can be regarded a hyperparameter. To identify the optimal setting of C, we repeatedly of remaining sites, e.g., {s n , q n , o n }. We present mean results of scaled pointwise predictive density (SPPD) and error metrics (weighted F1 / MSE) over 5 runs. We compare three variants of our model with C = 5 latent classes: a naive baseline fitted only to the single site that is removed at test time; an unfitted version, whose parameters are randomly drawn from the prior, and a fitted variant of the proposed model. In addition, we train four linear regression (LR) models to directly predict y n from y remain n . fit the model on the training set and evaluate it on the held-out set. We do so for each class setting in C = [3, . . . , 7] and find that C = 5 yields the best model fit overall, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Imputation Task</head><p>Procedure. Next, we conduct a data imputation task. On the held-out set, we remove one observed site from all event tuples and refer to it as y n -e.g., we remove all Goldstein values and obtain y n = {p n }. We use the remaining three-way event tuples y remain n = {s n , q n , o n } jointly with the posterior of θ to make predictions of y n . In particular, we draw samples from the posterior predictive distribution Baselines. We compare the proposed model against three baselines, where the first two baselines are simple and we expect our proposed model to outperform them. For the first baseline, we fit four versions of the proposed model to only one of the observed sites {s n , p n , q n , o n }. This naive baseline effectively just learns the empirical histogram of each site in the training set, and uses the relevant one to make predictions for y n -we refer to this as naive. For the second baseline, we use an unfitted version of the proposed model, whose parameters have been sampled from the prior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Extrinsic Evaluation: Time Series</head><p>In the last section, we intrinsically evaluated the proposed model by having it impute held-out data. In this section, we consider extrinsic evaluations of the proposed model, which seek to evaluate it on downstream predictive tasks for which it was not explicitly designed. In this section, we rely on features of events coded by NAVCO which our model does not access during training. In particular, NAVCO codes for the location ℓ n and the timestamp τ n of each event. We discretize time so that each event is associated with a specific month m n . Augmented with these extra characteristics, as well as with the mean intensity inferred by our model, each event n has the following attributes: {s n , p n , q n , o n , ℓ n , m n , zn }. In all of the tasks in this section, we split events according to their location ℓ n = ℓ and examine monthly-aggregated time series of the cardinal and ordinal quantities {p n , q n , zn }. In particular, we ask two questions: 1) whether zn adds predictive information for forecasting p n and q n , and 2) whether the model-based measure of intensity zn correlates with Google Trends more than just p n and q n . Event Time Series. We construct time series in the following way. We first run inference on a training dataset X to obtain posterior samples of the parameters {θ (t) } T t=1 . We then use the trained parameters to obtain intensity scores {z (t) } T t=1 for both events in the training set as well as events in a test set that the model did not access. We then compute zn for each n and re-scale the zn estimates to cover a [0, 1] range as we did with Goldstein values. For each location ℓ and month m appearing in the data, we then construct the  <ref type="table">2</ref>: Forecasting: we test how much predictive information our intensity time series zℓ holds on future developments of Goldstein values pℓ and casualty counts qℓ . In most cases, the vector autoregression (VAR) outperforms the autoregression in terms of mean squared error (MSE) (results reported are 10 -1 ) on the held-out set.</p><p>We find that zℓ holds information on both pℓ and qℓ as including zℓ as an additional time series performs en par with including pℓ or qℓ throughout the VAR experiments. If the p value of the corresponding Granger (Grang) test is small, we can reject the null hypothesis that the additional time series does not add predictive information.</p><p>posterior average intensity class zℓ,m :</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">zℓ,m = N n=1 zn 1(ℓ n = ℓ)1(m n = m) N n=1 1(ℓ n = ℓ)1(m n = m)<label>(13)</label></formula><p>For a given location ℓ, we refer to the full time series over months as zℓ and linearly interpolate the entries m corresponding to months for which there is no data. We similarly aggregate the observed sites per event to obtain time series of predicates pℓ and quantifiers qℓ .</p><p>Autoregressive Forecasting. Does knowledge of the inferred intensity time series zℓ improve forecasting of the Goldstein pℓ and casualty count qℓ time series? To test this, we first consider autoregressive (AR) models that forecast monthly values of each time series (e.g., pℓ,m ) based on the previous values of only that same time series (e.g., pℓ,1:(m-1) ). We then consider vector autoregressive (VAR) models that use multiple time series (e.g., pℓ,1:(m-1) and qℓ,1:(m-1) ) to form the same predictions. When incorporating values from our latent intensity time series zℓ , we must be careful to avoid test set leakage. To do so, we fit our model to a subset of data X \ℓ that excludes any events in a particular location ℓ. We obtain posterior samples</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">{θ (t)</formula><p>\ℓ } T t=1 by fitting the proposed model to X \ℓ . We then use these parameters to obtain zn for all events n in both the training X \ℓ and test set X ℓ .</p><p>Before fitting any (vector) autoregressive models and performing the forecasting experiments, we apply a first-order differencing transform to all time series to remove potential linear trends, and verify each time series' stationarity using an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fuller, 1976)</ref>. We then fit an autoregressive (AR) model to each individual time-series and a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to all pairs of time series. We determine their optimal orders (lag) in months using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and use cross validation to measure held-out forecasting error across 24 folds. In Tab. 2, we report results in mean squared error (MSE) on the held-out sets averaged over all 24 folds. Indeed, our results suggest that zℓ contains (predictive) information on both pℓ and qℓ . For instance, in the VAR experiments for forecasting pℓ , we may replace the additional time series qℓ with zℓ without any drop in performance. We also report Granger tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Granger, 1969)</ref> which test the null hypothesis that forecasting a variable (e.g., pℓ ) using only its own history is no less accurate than also using an additional variable's history (e.g., zℓ ).</p><p>Descriptive Analysis. A growing body of work analyzes the correlation between shifts in online behavior or media attention and conflict intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chykina and Crabtree, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Timoneda and Wibbels, 2022)</ref>. Following this line of work, we download time series of Google search keywords using the Google Trends Anchorbank (G-TAB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(West, 2020)</ref>. We constrain searches to the category of "World News" and use the country name of location ℓ as the search keyword. In contrast to the forecasting setting, we fit our model to the entire dataset X, including events associated with the respective location, and obtain an intensity time series zℓ . Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows a comparison between four time series: the Goldstein pℓ , casualty counts qℓ , our latent zℓ and the Google trends time series for Syria between 2004 and 2013. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> We observe that Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>: Time series of events in Syria between 2004 and 2013, all values averaged by month.

We look at Google trends as an external correlate for (perceived) conflict intensity and report correlations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>.  zℓ nicely interpolates between the time series of pℓ and qℓ . It captures larger trends and fluctuations in both time series, while not exactly mirroring either. Further, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, we report Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs of time series. While pℓ and qℓ are positively correlated, pℓ is more strongly correlated with zℓ than with qℓ . Moreover, Google trends are more strongly correlated with zℓ than either pℓ or qℓ . We hypothesize this may be due 2004 is the earliest date to query Google trends.</p><p>to the additional information on the subject s n and object types o n that z n encodes, and which may contribute to how much attention is paid to different conflicts, as measured by Google Trends.</p></div>

We could also condition observed sites on each other-e.g., casualty counts q n are conditionally dependent on o n or even p n under the model. We plan to further incorporate multiple latent variables to model multi-dimensional intensity concepts. Future models could also condition on location and include a temporal component to account for how surprisal may affect the perceived intensity of an event. We also note that the latent variable model presented in this work could also be extended to a more general framework for learning interpretable, ordinal scales from a set of mixed-type data that include cardinal or ordinal observations. We plan to explore generalizations of the proposed model and applications beyond of international relations. D3.
