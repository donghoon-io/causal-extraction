<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes a multidimensional generalization of the nominal categories model that serves to estimate factorial models from nominal and ordinal observed responses, and includes a structural model for latent variables that distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous factors. The model includes a scale parameter for each response category in each factor. Item parameters relate the logit between categories to the vector of latent variables. The inferential framework is marginal maximum likelihood, implemented via static and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature and Monte Carlo EM. The properties of estimators are investigated in a simulation study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multidimensional item response models have provided a means to analyze the dimensionality of a set of items since the pioneering work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bock, Gibbons, and Muraki (1988)</ref>. The item factor model typically applies to dichotomous and ordinal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Reckase, 2009)</ref>, whereas the factorial analysis of nominal responses is more recent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bock &amp; Gibbons, 2010)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Thissen, Cai, and Bock (2010)</ref> proposed a flexible multidimensional model that can accommodate a variety models between ordinal and nominal scales. This paper continues this line of research and presents a generalization of the nominal categories model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bock, 1972)</ref> to the multidimensional case. Moreover, a structural model can be imposed on the latent variables to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>The nominal categories model may be regarded as the most popular model for nominal responses because of its unique combination of flexibility and mathematical simplicity.</p><p>For these reasons, it is taken as the basis to develop a multidimensional nominal categories model (MNCM). The MNCM, in its full generality, imposes no constraints on item parameters. However, the paper describes a method of linear constrains that provides particular cases suitable for the analysis of ordinal data or for testing a hypothesis about parameter structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Revuelta, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Revuelta, , 2010))</ref>.</p><p>The MNCM has a factor loading for each category in each factor, instead of having one parameter for each variable in each factor, as in the factor analysis of quantitative and ordinal data. There are a number of new applications in which the factor loadings may differ between categories. For example, consider one multiple-choice item measuring mathematics in which one of the categories has an involved wording. This distractor may have a higher loading on a verbal factor than other categories written in more simple terms. More generally, two-dimensional item response models have been proposed in the psychometric literature to distinguish between a factor of substantive interest and a factor that explains individual differences in solution strategy or response style. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bolt and Johnson (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Johnson and Bolt (2010)</ref> analyzed ordinal responses from a self-report of smoking dependence. Their second factor explains response tendencies that are unrelated to the construct measured by the items. A similar idea was translated to maximum performance testing by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bolt and Wollack (2012)</ref>, who analyzed data from multiple-choice items in which there was a primary factor related to the correct option and a second factor that influences selection among distractors.</p><p>The present paper includes an example with real data that illustrates the application of the MNCM to investigating local dependencies originated by testlets. In this example, several items are clustered around a common theme, which leads to violation of the local independence assumption in a one-dimensional model. The paper shows how a polytomous multidimensional model can be used to analyze associations between categories from one item to another.</p><p>The paper also includes a number of technical developments, such as a marginal likelihood/EM estimation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Schilling &amp; Bock, 2005)</ref>, the computation of the information matrix, a structural latent model, and a Taylor series expansion to approximate the correlation between response categories. Finally, the recovery of theoretical parameters is investigated in a simulation study. Most technical material has been moved to appendices and the main body of the paper focuses on the description of the model, results of its application and the conclusions.</p></div>

Taken together, simulations show that adaptive-GH and MCEM improve static-GH when the number of items per factor is large and the structural model is simple. Static-GH selects quadrature points to optimize precision in the evaluation of the integral of a function over the population distribution of the factor: ( ) f  . Adaptive-GH and MCEM are based on a normal approximation the posterior distribution of the factor for each response pattern:</p><p>( | ) f  r . The normal approximation to ( | ) f  r is based on the MAP estimate of  and its dispersion matrix, and its quality improves as the test length increases. The advantage of adaptive-GH and MCEM may be more prominent in long tests, whereas in short tests the imprecision in the MAP estimate may present a challenge to these two methods.</p><p>Moreover, when the structural model is complicated, static-GH compares well with the other methods. One tentative explanation is that static-GH provides a stable basis for computing the integral over the latent space, whereas the instability inherent to adaptive-GH and MCEM may compromise the estimation of involved structural models for latent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Empirical example</head><p>The use of the MNCM to account for measurement problems is demonstrated with a real data set of an examination about inferential statistics. A sample of n = 353 second-course undergraduate students of psychology responded to 20 multiple-choice items as part of the final examination of the subject of data analysis, which ranged from one-sample t test to ANOVA, multiple comparisons, and linear regressions. The participants ranged from 19 to 30 years old and had 60 minutes to complete the test. Because data were collected for a real evaluation, the identity of the participants and any other information apart from the item responses were removed before the data matrix was submitted to investigation.</p><p>The test was structured in six testlets. Each testlet consisted of two or more items related to a common theme, and each item had three response categories. Identification constraints were as in Sec. 3.1. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">1</ref> illustrates two of the testlets.</p><p>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">1</ref>)</p><p>Six models were applied to these data. All the models are variants of a bifactor model, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">1</ref>, that has a general factor and six group factors that explain the associations within each testlet. The six models are as follows:</p><p> M1. Bifactor oblique. The correlations between the seven factors are free parameters. That is, the latent propensity is  M4. Testlet model. This is a polytomous generalization of the dichotomous testlet model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bradlow, Wainer, and Wang, X. (1999)</ref>. In that model, the scale parameters of the general and the group factor have the same value to obtain a correlation between latent propensities with a convenient structure; that is, the latent propensity is (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">1</ref>)</p><p>These models are obtained as particular cases of the MNCM by using the method for linear constraints described in Appendix B. The model was estimated with two quadrature points for each dimension, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schilling and Bock (2005)</ref> for a model with seven dimensions. However, note that this recommendation is based on the amount of computational resources that would be demanded by a larger number of points and not because two points is an optimal figure in a statistical sense. A number of statistics were used to test the model fit: the likelihood ratio for the hypothesis of exact fit, the likelihood ratio against the most general model, M1, and the statistics AIC, BIC, and AICc, which consider the model fit and parsimony <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2004)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">2</ref> shows the results. Model M3 was selected for interpretation because of the values G 2 , AIC, and AICc. Notwithstanding, BIC differs from the other statistics and points to M5 as the preferred model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">2</ref> contains also the mean estimation time in minutes from five different runs of the estimation algorithm using different random starting values.</p><p>Estimation time depends largely on the number of estimated parameters in the structural model in equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>).</p><p>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">2</ref>)</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">3</ref> presents the parameter estimates for M3. The item responses have been coded</p><p>such that the correct response is the third one, and categories one and two are the distractors. The scale parameters in the six group factors have been placed in the same column, labeled Group factor in the table, although they refer to a different factor for each testlet. All but two of the scale parameters in the general factor were negative, indicating negative correlations between the distractors and the general factor. Although estimates were unbounded in the simulation study in Sect. 5, estimates were bounded between -10 and 10 in the real data analysis because the sample contains insufficient information to estimate some parameters. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">3</ref> shows that eleven intercept parameters reached the boundary during estimation. This is due to insufficient sample size. For example, the two distractors of Item 6, whose parameters  are in the boundary, receive 6 and 8 responses. If the estimation is repeated without the bound of the parameters, these estimates converge at very extreme values, -18.4 and -19.8 for Item 6 with first order derivatives of 0.01 and 0.20 at convergence. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">3</ref> contains the results with the boundary because their actual estimated value is not important, the real problem is the lack of statistical information and the boundary helps to identify easily the weakly identifiable parameters.</p><p>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">3</ref>)</p><p>Testlet 3 presents a number of interesting features. First, distractor B of item 10 (in the following, distractor 10-B) has a positive loading on the general factor (10,2,1 = 0.37).</p><p>That is, the propensity to commit the misconception reflected in category B increases with 1, which indicates that this topic was not well clarified during the teaching of the subject. Second, the categories 9-A and 10-B have remarkable loadings on the group factor, with reversed signs. The group factor 4 seems to be bipolar in the sense that individuals high in 4 feel attracted by the error reflected in 10-B, and individuals low in 4 tend toward the irreconcilable error contained in 9-A. The association between 9-A and 10-B is quite predictable in relation to item content and is explored more deeply in the following paragraphs.</p><p>In the model M3, the principle of independence between alternatives conditional on 1 breaks down. To illustrate, the top row of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the marginal response functions for items 10 and 17, with the group factor marginalized out. The response functions vary depending on the response given to the other item in the same testlet (items 9 and 16, respectively), as shown in the second, third, and fourth rows of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The first item of the two testlets entails making a statistical decision about a null hypothesis, and the second item is the conclusion that follows from that decision. The interplay between the decisions and conclusions explains the associations. For example, the conclusion that two population means do not differ (category 10-B) has a smaller probability for those individuals that reject H0 (category 9-A) than for those who do not reject H0 (category 9-B).</p><p>(Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>)</p><p>Clustered items present an extra covariance beyond that explained by a one-dimensional latent trait. For the one-dimensional model, the covariance between items conditional on  is zero. Regarding M3, if the group factor is integrated out, the result is a marginal distribution of responses that depends only on 1 and has a non-null correlation between items. Ip (2010, Corollary 1) showed that the correlation between two dichotomous items, i and j, depends on the product of the scale parameters of the group factor. Appendix D extends that result to the polytomous case and shows how to compute item correlations in the marginal distribution that depends only on 1. The correlation depends largely on the product of the scale parameters but is not proportional to it. The key element that explains correlations in the polytomous case is the difference between a parameter and the mean of the scale parameters of the item. In particular, the correlation between categories r and s of items i and j is proportional to: </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">                      , (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>where 1 ik P  is the probability of the category when 2=0.

As expected, categories 9-B (the correct one) and 10-B (an incorrect one) have a positive relation, which singles out a frequent misconception about the conclusion of a significance test when H0 is maintained. Moreover, the correlation between the two correct categories, 9-B and 10-C, is negative because the distractor 10-B is more attractive for those who pass item 9 than for those who fail it, which is also predictable from item content. Regarding the second testlet, categories 16-A and 16-C have similar content and a comparable association pattern with 17-C, which is their logical consequence. Categories 17-A and 17-B have a subtle difference and obtain similar patterns of association with item 16.</p><p>(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Final remarks</head><p>The purpose of the MNCM is to measure factors by using nominal response data. The key aspect of the model is that that there is one slope parameter for each response category on each factor, instead of one slope for each item on each factor, as in factorial models for quantitative and ordinal data. In its more general form, it has minimal parameter constraints to ensure identifiability, although the paper shows how to impose more stringent restrictions by using linear constraints.</p><p>From a statistical point of view, the combination of multidimensionality and a heavy parameterization presents important challenges for estimation. The empirical example has shown that insufficient sample size may lead to weakly identifiable parameters.</p><p>Exploratory analyses, in which the number of factors is increased until the model fits and item parameters are unconstrained, demand samples with thousands of examinees and time-consuming computational resources. Problems of weakly identified parameters may arise in exploratory analyses with smaller samples. Weakly identifiable parameters are identifiable in a mathematical sense, but the data provide scarce information about them, originating problems of convergence and large standard errors. Confirmatory analysis seems more tenable because fixed parameters and a smaller number of dimensions per item reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem involved in estimation and increase statistical information about the remaining parameters.</p><p>The model has been developed in a traditional item response theory framework, with strong distributional assumptions for latent factors and a marginal likelihood estimation algorithm. Three integration methods have been compared: adaptive GH, static GH, and MCEM. The simulation results revealed that adaptive GH provides the greatest precision, especially with a large number of items per factor. However, the estimation of a structured variance-covariance matrix for the factors could be more precise with static GH because of the increased stability of this method. The numerical integration problem limits the dimensionality of the latent space to about eight factors, and clearly, an area of further research is the development of more effective estimation methods for higher dimensionality with a reasonable demand for computational resources.</p><p>Ideally, an improved algorithm should allow faster estimation and increased dimensionality. The development of better algorithms, within the maximum likelihood framework, may be based on the Metropolis-Hastings Robins-Monro integration algorithm by <ref type="bibr">Cai (2010-b)</ref>. Estimation of the bifactor model can also be accelerated by applying the dimension reduction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cai, Yang, &amp; Hansen, 2011)</ref>, which reduces the D-dimensional integration problem to two-dimensional integration. Fully Bayesian simulation techniques are another promising inferential framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Edwards, 2010)</ref>. The inclusion of diffuse priors may speed up the estimation algorithm by avoiding cases in which weakly identified parameters use a long sequence of iterations to converge.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bayesian simulation methods would also benefit from the use of the output of the EM maximization to construct a multivariate normal approximation of the posterior distribution of the parameters, which can be used to obtain samples of parameters. The assumption of multivariate normality of the latent variables has been made to avoid further complications although its relaxation is another topic for future research.</p><p>For any matrix W of order K × L, write W, ( )    W W 1 , and   W SW as:</p><p>  and 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">                     A A 1 W W W A 1b b b (A1)</formula><p>where A is a matrix of order (K-1) × L, 1 is a vector of ones, and b is a row vector.

One hundred simulated samples were taken for each of the 18 conditions of the experimental design (three integration methods  three numbers of quadrature points  two sample sizes). The starting values were taken at random from a uniform (-1, 1) distribution. The convergence criterion was a length of the gradient vector smaller than 0.01.

No important difference was found in the recovery of factor scores between the simulation conditions. A second simulation was performed to investigate recovery with a more sophisticated latent structure.

The increase in the number of items per factor improves the normal approximation and, consequently, the precision of the adaptive-GH and MCEM methods. The correlations between true and estimated values of  were about 0.91 for factor 1, 0.80 for factor 2 and 0.85 for factor 3, with small changes across conditions.

The estimation time could be reduced by optimizing the computer code. Some optimizations are more suitable for some methods than for others, and the relative speed of the methods may be altered. For example, static-GH may be largely optimized because it is based on a fixed grid of weights and values of , and many partial results can be stored in a table that is reused for all response patterns. This optimization, which was not implemented in the present study, is unfeasible for adaptive-GH because the grid changes during iterations and from one response pattern to another. However, the exponential increase in time within each method seems unavoidable. The main difficulty in conducting the simulation study was the long estimation time for some conditions. Although parameter estimates are unbounded in the simulation, no problem of convergence arose because models are relatively simple, with few categories per item and large samples. The gradient of the log likelihood was monitored and it goes to zero for all conditions. However, the stopping criterion is based on parameter changes because, near the maximum of the likelihood, gradient reduces very slow and estimates changes little during iterations. The speed of convergence varies between samples within each condition. The number of iterations for estimation was typically about 40, although convergence required only about 10 iterations in some samples and more than 120 in others. The number of quadrature points is below the recommendation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schilling and Bock (2005)</ref> for some of the conditions of the simulations. This is so because running the simulations with more points would have demanded a prohibitive amount of computational resources. However, results showed that recovery did not improved much by increasing the number of points. Apparently, relatively simple models do not need a large number of points. The simplicity of simulated models avoids convergence problems. However, these problems may easily arise from the combination of small samples and complex models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A computer program was written in the C++ language using the Borland Builder 6 compiler. The simulations were run in a computer equipped with an Intel Xeon E5-1620 processor clocked at 3.60 GHz, 10 MB cache, and 4 cores, with 12 GB RAM, running Microsoft Windows 7 on 64 bits.</p><p>After some pilot runs with models of varying complexity, it was clear that the numerical integration procedures are computationally demanding and time-consuming. For these reasons and because the simulation means repeating the estimation algorithm for thousands of artificial data matrices, relatively simple conditions were used in the simulations to keep the computational demands within a manageable limit. Although the conditions of the simulation involve few dimensions, factors, and categories, they are illustrative of the relative performance of the estimation method for the different types of parameters. In the first simulation, a model with two orthogonal factors, each measured by 15 dichotomous items, was assumed. True item and individual parameter values were sampled from a standard normal distribution. Table <ref type="table">C</ref>-1 contains true item parameters.</p><p>The three integration methods were compared. The number of quadrature points for each dimension was 3, 5, and 7 so the total number of points for numerical integration was 9, 25, and 49, respectively. These figures were taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Schilling &amp; Bock, 2005)</ref>, who recommend as few as two points for six or more factors. Thus, the condition with three quadrature points is informative about the expected precision in the worst case, whereas the other conditions are more realistic for a model with two factors.</p></div>			</div>
