<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In educational measurement, various methods have been proposed to infer student proficiency from the ratings of multiple items (e.g., essays) by multiple raters. However, suitable models quickly become numerically demanding or even unfeasible as separate latent variables are needed to account for local dependencies between the ratings of the same response. Therefore, in the present paper we derive a flexible approach based on Thurstone's law of categorical judgment. The advantage of this approach is that it can be fit using weighted least squares estimation which is computationally less demanding as compared to most of the previous approaches in the case of an increasing number of latent variables. In addition, the new approach can be applied using existing latent variable modeling software. We illustrate the model on a real dataset from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMSS) comprising ratings of 10 items by 4 raters for 150 subjects. In addition, we compare the new model to existing models including the facet model, the hierarchical rater model, and the hierarchical rater latent class model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the field of educational measurement inferences about students' latent proficiencies underlying educational tests are commonly based on item response theory (IRT) modeling tools. In standard cases, the educational test is purported to measures a single proficiency (unidimensionality) without residual associations between the students' observed scores on the different items (local independence). In educational practice however, items may be clustered because they measure multiple latent variables (e.g., in worded arithmetic problems) or because they concern different testlets. In addition, students may be clustered within classrooms and schools. Neglecting these properties of the testing situation violates the assumptions of the IRT model which can result in biased or inefficient inferences concerning the students' proficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sireci, Wainer &amp; Thissen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wainer, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wainer &amp; Thissen, 1996)</ref>. Therefore, more sophisticated models need to be considered including multidimensional IRT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Béguin &amp; Glas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Reckase, 2009)</ref>, models for testlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bradlow, Wainer, &amp; Wang, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cai, 2010a)</ref>, and multilevel or hierarchical IRT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams, Wilson, &amp; Wu, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mislevy &amp; Bock, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fox &amp; Glas, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>A specific testing situation in education measurement concerns the case in which the scoring of the student's performance is not objectively possible using an answer key. For instance, in an essay assignment, the grade that a student obtains may depend on the rater that graded the essay. A straightforward and standard solution is to use multiple raters for the same essay. However, the data will violate both the assumption of unidimensionality and local independence, as the items and the students are clustered within the raters. The challenge is to account for these violations by modeling differences among raters in their rater characteristics. The so-called facet model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Linacre, 1989)</ref> has previously being used to address this challenge (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Engelhard, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Engelhard, , 1996;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wilson &amp; Wang, 1995)</ref> and can be considered a common method to model students' ratings. The facet model extends the standard IRT modeling approach by adding a fixed effect for the 'rater severity' to account for differences in rater characteristics. Rater severity refers to the tendency of a rater to assign lower scores to a given response as compared to other raters. That is, the rater severity parameter can be seen as the rater counterpart of the item difficulty parameter.</p><p>However, although the rater severity parameter accounts for differences across raters, it does not account for the dependency between ratings of the same responses. That is, all rater-item combinations are treated as locally independent. Neglecting the fact that only a subset of these data are locally independent indicators for the students' proficiency has been shown to overestimate the reliability of the students' assessment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mariano, 2002, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hoskens, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>As will be discussed below, effort has been devoted to develop suitable models that take both the common rater and the common item effects into account. Although valuable, these models quickly become numerically demanding if the number of items and number of subjects increases. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new approach that takes the different dependencies in the data into account in a similar way as the existing models, but which can be estimated in a numerically less demanding way. The outline of this paper is as follows: Below we review the current modeling approach and discuss the numerical challenges that motivated the development of our model. Next, as our modeling approach builds upon these models, we start by formally presenting the hierarchical rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz et al. (2002)</ref>, the hierarchical rater latent class model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">DeCarlo et al. (2011)</ref>, and the generalized rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang et al., (2014)</ref>. Next, we derive our new model, the hierarchical rater thresholds model, and we present an application to real data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMSS) comprising ratings of 10 items by 4 raters for 150 subjects. We end with a general discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Current Models</head><p>As mentioned above, effort has been devoted to develop suitable models for local dependencies due to multiple ratings of the same responses. Among these approaches are the IRT model for multiple raters <ref type="bibr">(Verhelst &amp; Verstralen, 2001)</ref>, the rater bundle model <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wilson &amp; Hoskens, 2001)</ref>, the hierarchical rater model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Casabianca, Junker, &amp; Patz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz, Junker, Johnson, &amp; Mariano, 2002)</ref>, the hierarchical rater latent class model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(DeCarlo, Kim, &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>, and the generalized rater model <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang, Su, &amp; Qiu, 2014)</ref>. The models are similar in that they account for the common rater effect by rater parameters similarly as in the facet model. The models differ however in the way that they account for the common item effect, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The rater bundle model is the most different from the other approaches. In this model, the common item effects are introduced by means of a fixed linear interaction term between pairs of raters of the same item. The interaction effect accounts for the degree to which two raters agree more than what would have been expected on the basis of the student proficiency and the raters' severities.</p><p>In the other models, the common item effect is modeled by introducing a separate latent variable for each item, denoted the ideal ratings. The most important difference between the models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> is that the hierarchical rater model and the hierarchical rater latent class model treat these ideal ratings as categorical variables (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">DeCarlo, 2005)</ref> while in the IRT model for multiple raters and the generalized raters model, the ideal ratings are continuous latent variables. Besides these differences, the models differ in the number of rater parameters. That is, all models, except the facet model and the IRT model for multiple raters, include an additional rater parameter besides the rater severity. The so-called rater variability parameter models the variability in the ratings by the raters. That is, some raters can be more variable in their ratings as compared to other raters. In these models, the rater severity and the rater variability can be either rater specific, or item and rater specific. In the hierarchical rater latent class model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">DeCarlo et al. (2011)</ref> the rater parameters are specified in a somewhat different way with rater severities being item, rater, and response category depended, and the rater variability being rater and item depended. Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">DeCarlo et al. (2011)</ref> use respectively 'response criteria' and 'detection parameters' to refer to these parameters respectively. We will explicate this difference later in the formal model presentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Estimation Challenges</head><p>The models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> differ in the estimation procedures used to apply the models. That is, while the hierarchical rater model and the generalized rater model rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, the hierarchical rater latent class model, the rater bundle model, and the facet model rely mainly on Marginal Maximum Likelihood (MML). Although certainly feasible, both MCMC and MML have their computational challenges with respect to models with a large number of latent variables. As all models but the rater bundle and the facet model include a separate latent variable for each item, the number of latent variables increases rapidly for an increasing number of items. In such high dimensional models, MCMC will become slow and MML may even become unfeasible (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wood et al., 2002</ref>; although more efficient MML algorithms have been proposed by e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cai, 2010b)</ref>. In the case of the rater bundle model, as noted by <ref type="bibr">Patz et al. and Wilson and Hoskens (2001)</ref>, MML estimation becomes computationally infeasible for an increasing number of items and/or raters due to the rapid increase in the number of interaction terms that are needed. In addition, for the IRT model for multiple raters no estimation algorithm has been developed yet as the maximization of the marginal likelihood function is not easy as discussed in Verhelst and Verstralen (2001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Hierarchical Rater Thresholds Model</head><p>As discussed above, both MML and MCMC have their challenges when it comes to datasets with an increasing number of items. Therefore, if the number of items is large, a practical model is desirable that both accounts for the variability due to multiple raters and multiple items, but which can also be estimated in large datasets in a numerically efficient way. Therefore, in this paper, we present such an approach. We refer to this approach as 'The Hierarchical Rater Thresholds Model' as the model is a hierarchical model and accounts for differences across raters by explicitly separating the raters' effects from the item effects on the threshold parameters of the categorical observed variables.</p><p>The hierarchical rater threshold model draws from the hierarchical rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz et al (2002)</ref>, the hierarchical rater latent class model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">DeCarlo et al., (2011)</ref>, and the generalized rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang et al. (2014)</ref>. In addition, it utilizes Thurstone's model for categorical <ref type="bibr">judgement (1928;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Torgerson, 1958)</ref> in the rater part of the model, and it includes the IRT model for multiple raters by <ref type="bibr">Verhelst and Verstralen (2002)</ref> as a special case. The most important features of the hierarchical rater thresholds model are: 1) The model includes less latent variables as compared to the generalized rater model while still accounting for both variability due to difference in items and differences in raters; 2) The model is formulated in such a way that the parameters can be estimated using Weighted Least Squares (WLS; <ref type="bibr">Muthén, 1984)</ref>, an estimation procedure that is more robust to an increasing numbers of latent variables in terms of convergence and computation time as compared to MCMC and MML; and 3) Similarly to the generalized rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang et al. (2014)</ref>, the proposed model is a generalized linear latent variable model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartholomew, Knott, &amp; Moustaki, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Moustaki &amp; Knott, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Skrondal, &amp; Rabe-Hesketh, 2004</ref>) which provides possibilities to fit the model in standard and flexible software packages like Mplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2007)</ref>, Lisrel <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jöreskog, &amp; Sörbom , 2001)</ref>, Amos <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arbuckle, 1997)</ref>, Mx <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Neale, Boker, Xie, &amp; Maes, 2006)</ref>, SAS (SAS Institute, 2011), and OpenMX <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boker et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Level 1: Thurstone's model for categorical judgement</head><p>Thurstone's model for categorical judgement postulates that categorical judgements in X pir arise by categorization of an underlying normally distributed continuum at increasing thresholds. Here, we use this idea by assuming that the ideal scores ξ pi represent the continuous score that item i by student p should have obtained in the case that an unambiguous and objective continuous scoring rule was available. These continuous scores ξ pi are then internally categorized by the raters at rater and item specific thresholds. Thus, the model postulates that observed ratings of the same item by the same student may differ depending on the rater as raters differ in the thresholds they use to categorize the continuous ideal scores ξ pi , that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">X pir = c if τ irc &lt; ξ pi &lt; τ ir(c+1) for c = 0, …, C -1 (5)</formula><p>where τ irc denotes the c-th threshold of rater r on item i with τ i0r = -∞ and τ iCr = ∞. Note that the thresholds do not depend on the student p as we assume, as explicitly discussed in Verhest and Verstralen <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref>, that the raters solely base their assessment of item i by student p on the quality of the response and not on other indications for that specific student proficiency (as might for instance happen when the raters are also the students' teachers such that they have an a priori expectation about the students proficiency).</p><p>The thresholds in Eq. 5 do not yet include separate item and rater parameters. That is, irrespective of the rater, on some items it may be harder to obtain a high rating because the item is more difficult. In addition, irrespective of the item, it may be harder to obtain a higher rating for some raters because these raters are less lenient.

For reasons of identification, φ ir and ψ ir should be fixed to 0 and 1 for all items for an arbitrarily chosen rater to provide a reference point. Note that φ ir and ψ ir are identified as they account for item and rater specific departures from the main item effect in β ic . Parameters φ ir and ψ ir can be tested to be iteminvariant, that is, φ ir =φ r and ψ ir = ψ r .

Note that in this model, the thresholds (and thus φ ir and ψ ir ) are on a probit scale. The item specific discrimination parameter can be identified by fixing λ ir = 1 for all items (i) of an arbitrary rater (τ), or by fixing σ 2 ξi = 1 for all items (i). Parameter λ ir can be constraint to only reflect a rater effect (λ ir = λ r ), an item effect (λ ir = λ i ), or a common effect (λ ir = λ) which is equivalent to omitting λ ir from Eq. 7 (as the common effect λ can be absorbed in σ 2 ξi ). All these extension can be combined with item specific or item invariant rater parameters for τ irc in Eq. 6. We illustrate this in the real data application.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Estimation of the Hierarchical Rater Thresholds Model</head><p>The full hierarchical rater thresholds model is given by Eq. 6, Eq. 7, and Eq. 8 with a normal distribution for q p . It is a hierarchical model with first-order factors, ξ pi , second-order factor q p and constraints on the item category parameters. As all relations in this full model are generalized linear, the model is a member of the generalized linear latent variable modeling framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartholomew, Knott, &amp; Moustaki, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Moustaki &amp; Knott, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Skrondal, &amp; Rabe-Hesketh, 2004</ref>). An appealing property of the hierarchical rater thresholds model being a generalized linear latent variable model is that we can estimate the parameters by WLS estimation (see <ref type="bibr">Muthén, 1984)</ref>. As discussed above, WLS is a suitable and numerically less demanding estimation procedure in the case of an increasing number of latent variables. As in typical models for raters, the number of random effects increases rapidly if the number of items increases. In WLS, the following fitting function is minimized over σ, the vector of model implied polychoric means and correlations (which are a function of the free model parameters in Eq. 6, Eq. 7, and Eq. 8):</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = (𝒔𝒔𝒔𝒔 -𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈) 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑾𝑾𝑾𝑾 -1 (𝒔𝒔𝒔𝒔 -𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈) 𝜑𝜑𝜑𝜑 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 -𝜑𝜑𝜑𝜑 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝1 𝜓𝜓𝜓𝜓 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 /𝜓𝜓𝜓𝜓 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝1 .</formula><p>where s is a vector of the estimated polychoric means and correlations of the observed data and W is the covariance matrix of these estimates, V. Matrix W can become large for an increasing number of observed variables. As W has to be inverted during estimation, the true benefits of WLS are obtained if W is taken to be the diagonal of V (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Flora, &amp; Curran, 2004)</ref>. In that case, the standard errors of the model parameters and the χ 2 goodness-of-fit statistic need to be corrected for the loss of information due to the neglect of the off-diagonal elements of V during estimation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Muthén, du Toit, &amp; Spisic, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>As in WLS, expectations are taken over the latent variables ξ pi and θ p in vector in σ, these latent variables do not have to be estimated (as in MCMC) or marginalized out (as in MML). The estimation procedure is therefore numerically less demanding, even if there are many latent ξ pi variables (see <ref type="bibr">Muthén, Muthén &amp; Asparouhov, 2005)</ref>. In a simulation study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beauducel and Herzberg (2006)</ref> showed that a sample size of 250 subjects is enough to fit models up to 8 latent variables and 40 ordinal variables with 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 point scales. To compare: <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wood et al (2002)</ref> discuss that more than 5 latent variables is already infeasible for MML (i.e., MML using conventional Gauss-Hermite quadrature approximation; the maximum number of latent variables can be increased by using more efficient approximations as proposed by e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cai, 2010b</ref>, but still the estimation can quickly become -at least practically -infeasible).</p></div>

Specifically, the data were collected within the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMSS) in 2007 in Turkey. The data comprise ratings from four raters of 10 items by 150 8 th grade students. The raters are all middle school teachers. The items were rated on a 6-point scale. The data were collected in a fully crossed design with all students responding to all items which in turn were rated by all teachers.</p><p>Although the data come from a large-scale international assessment, the size of the dataset is admittedly not extremely large (10 items, 4 raters, and 150 subjects). However, we note that the dataset is large enough to demonstrate the value of our approach. That is, in the present dataset MML based approaches are already (practically) infeasible as the model contains 10 latent variables for the common item effects. In addition, as described below, estimation time for the hierarchical rater model by MCMC is already five times longer than the estimation time of our WLS based approach.</p></div>

As can be seen, all hierarchical rater thresholds models have an acceptable fit according to the RMSEA with values between 0.058 and 0.79. According to the CFI and TLI, all rater thresholds models fit well with values close to 0.98/0.99. On the contrary, the facet version of the rater threshold model fits poorly. The facet model with item specific rater parameters has a CFI value of 0.911, a TLI value of 0.916, and a RMSEA value of 0.178. The item invariant model also fits poorly with a CFI value of 0.908, a TLI value of 0.919, and a RMSEA value of 0.175.</p><p>Parameter estimates for the rater parameters, φ ir and ψ ir in the different rater threshold models are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, 5, 2 Configuration of the 'average laptop' is: Intel Core i5 CPU (2.30 Ghz) with 8Gb RAM memory and 6 for Models 1a to 2d from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Note that Models 3a to 3d do not have separate rater parameters (i.e., φ ir = φ = 0 and ψ ir = ψ = 1 for identification reasons in these models). As can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and 5, estimates for φ ir and ψ ir hardly differ across Models 1a to 1d. That is, the exact configuration of λ ir does not importantly affect the rater severity and variability estimates, at least for this dataset. However, it can be seen that within a rater, φ ir and ψ ir differ across items. For instance, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> it can be seen that the estimated severity of rater 2 equals -0.445 (SE: 0.234) on item 5 and 0.535 (SE: 0.079) on item 8. Similar differences are notable for ψ ri in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> Thus, the rater threshold model clearly outperforms the facet model, which was to be expected as the facet model does not take the common item effects into account. However, for the different rater threshold models, it is more difficult to select to best fitting model as all fit indices (especially the TLI and CFI) are very close. Therefore, the question arises which model to choose. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, have restrictions on φ ir and ψ ir generally decreases model fit. That is, all models with restrictions on φ ir and ψ ir fit less well as compared to their corresponding model without restrictions on φ ir and ψ ir . With respect to the restrictions on λ ir is can be seen that have item specific (λ i ) or rater specific (λ r ) parameters generally decreases model fit as compared to an unrestricted λ ir . However, having a common parameter, λ ir = λ is associated with the best fit. Thus statistically, one would choose the model with an unrestricted φ ir and ψ ir and a common parameter for λ as this model is -at least statistically -the best fitting model. However, as the model fit is close, in practice one would want to take practical and substantive considerations into account as well. In addition, one should keep in mind that the fit measures that we used (CFI, TLI, and RMSEA) tell something about the model implied polychoric correlations. For instance, a difference in RMSEA of 0.002 between Model A and B indicates that Model B is better in describing the polychoric correlation matrix than Model A. Thus in practice, if models have similar RMSEA values, the question is if these differences (i.e., differences in how well the polychoric correlation matrix is described) are important for the research goal at hand.</p></div>

As can be seen, the fit indices are slightly mixed with respect to the model that is indicated as the best fitting model. That is, the AIC prefers the model with τ irc = τ ic and λ ir = λ ir while the AICc prefers the model with τ irc = τ rc and λ ir = λ. The BIC and CAIC both agree in that the model with τ irc = τ rc and λ ir = λ ir is the best fitting model. Therefore, we accept this model as the final hierarchical latent class model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Modeling results: Comparison</head><p>A direct comparison between the rater threshold model and the hierarchical rater latent class model is not possible as estimation of the former is not based on a likelihood function. As a result, for the rater threshold model, no  is not considered as it is not identified (see main text). In addition, '#par' denotes: number of parameters in the model. likelihood based model fit statistics can be calculated. However, an indirect comparison is possible as the best fitting models can be compared in terms of the effects that are included. That is, the final rater threshold model was argued to be the model with item and rater specific severity and scale parameters φ ir and ψ ir and with rater and item invariant parameter λ. For the hierarchical rater latent class model, the final model includes τ irc = τ rc and λ ir = λ ir . Both models thus agree on rater and item specific effects, however, in the latent class model, the rater effects are modeled in the thresholds, while the items effects are modeled in the rater discrimination parameter λ ir . This is in accordance with how <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">DeCarlo et al. (2011)</ref> proposed the compare the hierarchical rater latent class model to the hierarchical rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz et al. (2002)</ref>. That is, De Carlo et al compare irc and λ ir from the hierarchical latent class model to respectively φ r and ψ r from the hierarchical rater model. A comparison in terms of parameter estimates between the rater threshold model and the hierarchical rater latent class model is challenging as the threshold parameters τ irc are restricted in a different way (but see DeCarlo et al., 2011 for a possible graphical approach). Here, we focus on a comparison between the rater threshold model and the hierarchical rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz et al. (2002)</ref> as both models include comparable rater severity and rater scale parameters φ ir and ψ ir . See below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Modeling results: Comparison</head><p>In comparing the rater parameters φ ir and ψ ir between the hierarchical rater model and the rater threshold model a transformation of the hierarchical rater model parameters is necessary. That is, in the rater threshold model, the rater parameters reflect the differences among the raters relative to rater 1, as for this rater, φ i1 = 0 and ψ i1 = 0 for identification reasons. Therefore, the comparison between the rater parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, 5, and 6 should be based on the ordering of the raters. That is, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> it can be seen that for rater severity, φ r , the hierarchical rater model and the rater threshold model result in the same ordering of the raters (i.e., from least to most severe: 1,2,4,3). For the rater scale parameter however, the models differ in their implied ordering. That is, for the rater threshold model the ordering from smallest scale to widest scale is: 1, 2, 4, and 3, while the ordering for the hierarchical rater model is: 4, 2, 1, and 3.</p><p>To look more into the relation between the rater parameters from the two models, we transform the hierarchical rater model parameters to reflect rater severity and scale relative to the first rater, that is: Next, for raters 2, 3, and 4, we correlate these transformed parameters from the hierarchical rater model to the parameter from the rater threshold model. In addition, we consider the observed marginal means (M ir = MEAN p (X pir )) and standard deviations (S ir = SD p (X pir )) of the rater's item ratings. Similar to above, we also transformed these statistics into a measure relative to rater 1 (M ' ir and S '</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = (𝒔𝒔𝒔𝒔 -𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈) 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑾𝑾𝑾𝑾 -1 (𝒔𝒔𝒔𝒔 -𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈) 𝜑𝜑𝜑𝜑 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ′ = 𝜑𝜑𝜑𝜑 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 -𝜑𝜑𝜑𝜑 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝1</formula></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> depicts the correlations between the relative hierarchical rater parameters, the relative rater statistics, and the rater parameters from the rater threshold model. As can be seen, the correlations between M ' ir and φ ' HRM are generally large for all three raters (around 0.970). The  correlation between M ' ir and φ RTM is about as large for rater 2 (0.936), but somewhat smaller for rater 2 (0.853) and rater 3 (0.729). The correlation between φ ' HRM and φ RTM is large for raters 2 and 3 (around 0.900), but somewhat smaller for rater 4 (0.648). Next, the correlation between SD ir and ψ ' HRM is small and negative (between -0.129 and -0.363) while the correlation between SD ir and ψ RTM is larger and positive (between 0.358 and 0.609). The correlation between ψ ' HRM and ψ RTM is also negative (between -0.311 and -0.521). Thus overall, it seems that both φ ' HRM and φ RTM capture marginal relative mean differences between raters well, with the hierarchical rater model being somewhat better, while the rater threshold model captures relative differences in the marginal standard deviation better. As we focused on the transformed parameters of the hierarchical rater model relative to rater 1, we also provide the correlations between the untransformed hierarchical rater parameters and M ir and S ir , see Table <ref type="table">8</ref>. As can be seen, the S ir now correlates positively with the rater scale parameter φ ir although this correlation is small for rater 1 and 3.</p><p>In conclusion, φ ir from the hierarchical rater model and from the rater threshold model can both be used to quantify relative differences between raters in the marginal means. The scale parameter ψ ir from the hierarchical rater model is not suitable to quantify relative differences between raters in the marginal standard deviations while ψ ir from the rater threshold model performs better in this respect. Thus, the rater threshold should ideally be preferred if the aim is to quantify relative differences between raters. However, if the aim is to quantify differences between items within a rater, the hierarchical rater model is better suitable as for the rater threshold model, only relative differences between raters are quantified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>In this paper we presented a method to infer student proficiency from items rated by multiple raters. As we relied on WLS estimation, we argued that our approach is suitable for large scale educational settings where multiple latent variables are needed to account for violations of local independence. Our argument is mainly a pragmatic one. There may be good reasons to choose the hierarchical rater model or a Bayesian approach over the present approach. For instance, contrary to the Bayesian hierarchical rater model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz et al. (2002)</ref>, our approach is sensitive to small sample sizes. That is, for decreasing sample sizes, parameter estimates in the present model will become biased or even infeasible. In such cases, a Bayesian approach like the hierarchical rater model is desired. In addition, there may be substantive/conceptual reasons to choose for the hierarchical rater model due to the categorical nature of the ideal scores in this model. For instance, as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mariano &amp; Junker (2007)</ref>, if the common item effects are treated as continuous variables, these cannot be interpreted as "ideal scores" because the scale differs from those of the observed ratings.</p><p>Despite sample size considerations, there are two more trade-offs associated with our approach (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Muthén, Muthén, &amp; Asparouhov, 2015)</ref>. First, our approach is more sensitive to the number of variables in the analysis as compared to MCMC or MML. That is, as the estimation of our model is based on the asymptotic covariance matrix of the polychoric means and correlations, it becomes more and more challenging to estimate the full matrix if there are both many raters and many items. However, as in practice the number of raters is commonly limited, the present approach will be suitable in many cases. Second, contrary to MML and MCMC approaches, our approach is a limited information approach which only uses the information from the first two polychoric moments in the data. However, the effects of neglecting higher-Table <ref type="table">8</ref>: For each rater, the correlations between the rater mean (M r ) and the rater standard deviation (SD r ) of the observed item ratings (X pir ), and the rater parameters φ ir and ψ ir from the hierarchical rater model (HRM order moments is generally considered to be small (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Christoffersson, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>The main difference between the present approach and other approaches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wilson &amp; Hoskens, 2001)</ref> is that the rater effects are treated as effects on the thresholds at which an underlying continuum is categorized by the raters. We chose this approach both for pragmatic reasons (i.e., to be in the generalized linear latent variable modeling framework) and substantive reasons (i.e., to facilitate the psychological interpretation of the parameters using Thurstone's law of categorical judgment, 1928). This choice implies that the rater effect is treated as a fixed effect. This different from, for instance, <ref type="bibr">Snijders and Bosker (1999, Chapter 11)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang et al. (2014)</ref>. The question whether the rater effect is a random or a fixed effect is probably an empirical one. If the raters are truly selected randomly from a larger pool of raters, it might be best to account for this source of variation. However, we think that in practice, raters are selected according to specific criteria (e.g., availability, rating skill, acquaintance with the topic to be rated, etc.) such that the assumption of fixed rater effects is defendable.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A graphical representation of the hierarchical rater thresholds model.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,51.02,63.93,395.53,246.87" type="bitmap" /></figure>
