This thinning appears to be slower in childhood, accelerated during adolescence, and again decelerated in young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Zhou, Lebel, Treit, Evans, &amp; Beaulieu, 2015)</ref>. In general, the thinning process is associated with cortical surface flattening, loss of surface area, and gyral white matter expansion <ref type="bibr">(Alemán-Gómez et al., 2013)</ref>. Despite the general thinning trend at the group level, studies have found cortical thickening in some adolescent individuals (c.f., <ref type="bibr">Román et al., 2018)</ref>. In fact, previous research has shown that environmental factors such as maternal parenting style have a relevant effect in childhood and adolescent cortical development <ref type="bibr">(Whittle et al., Time-lagged associations between cognitive and</ref><ref type="bibr">cortical development -4 2014, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Brain structure is associated with human cognitive functions, with literature indicating that that individual differences in cognitive abilities are related to individual differences in various measures of brain structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Colom &amp; Thompson, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Considering these associations, locating links between the maturational development of both domains from childhood to early adulthood is relevant for understanding the neurological basis of individual differences in general cognitive abilities.</p><p>An increasing number of studies have been conducted to understand these developmental patterns by analyzing their relations in healthy individuals from childhood to early adulthood. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Karama et al. (2009)</ref> found positive associations between a general factor of cognitive ability and cortical thickness in multimodal association areas in a sample of ages 6-18. They interpreted this finding as evidence for a distributed model of intelligence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burgaleta, Johnson, Waber, Colom &amp; Karama (2014)</ref> studied a sample of ages 6-21 and found that individuals with IQ gains over time show no significant changes in their cortical thickness, whereas those without any IQ change, and particularly with IQ decrements, show cortical thinning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Koenis et al. (2015)</ref> observed relations between changes in brain network efficiency and changes in intellectual performance (ages 9 to 18). Specifically, increases in intellectual functioning were related with increases in global and local efficiency as measured by fractional anisotropy (especially in the frontal and temporal areas), and with decreases in local efficiency based on streamline count (frontal cingulate and occipital areas). <ref type="bibr">Román et al. (2018)</ref> analyzed the relation between developmental changes in general cognitive ability and cortical thickness and cortical surface area changes in individuals from 6 to 21 years, finding that increases in intelligence were generally associated with increases in total cortical thickness and cortical surface area. Moreover, in agreement Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -5 with previous evidence, they found greater cortical decrease and smaller intellectual increase in older individuals.</p><p>Findings from this literature suggest substantial relations between cortical and intellectual development, but the aforementioned studies explored the such relations using concurrent associations between cognitive and cortical changes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wendelken et al.'s (2017)</ref> research is one exception, however. They analyzed lead-lag relations between structural and functional brain indices and reasoning ability within an age range of 6-22 years. Their findings indicate that structural connectivity between rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal lobe predicts changes in reasoning ability. Their conclusion was that maturation of white matter enhances reasoning. Nevertheless, only data at two time points were considered and they applied a regression model in which only structural connectivity was allowed to predict changes in cognitive ability. They did not explore the opposite possibility, nor did they include reciprocal influences in the same statistical model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Latent change score models for neurocognitive development</head><p>LCS models (also called Latent Difference Score, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ferrer &amp; McArdle, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">McArdle, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McArdle, , 2009;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McArdle &amp; Hamagami, 2001)</ref> have been increasingly used Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -6 in the last decades due to their flexibility for modeling longitudinal change in multivariate systems, including mean changes and time-sequential dynamic relations.</p><p>Their key feature is that they focus on the change in the variables -instead of their level-, and they allow studying which elements of a system have an effect on that change. For this, the latent changes on each of the variables are specified at each repeated occasion. These latent changes are modeled as the difference in the latent scores of a variable y between a given occasion and the next (Δy). At each occasion, the latent level is a function of the initial unobserved level (y0), plus the accumulation of changes up to that occasion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McArdle, 2009, for</ref>  We note that existing studies included two repeated measures of the cognitive and brain variables of interest (c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anblagan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kievit et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lövdén et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Raz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ritchie et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, latent change could be estimated at one time point only (t2-t1). This allows computing latent correlations between brain and cognitive changes, but it does not allow estimating more complex lead-lag relations involving longer sequences. Similarly, available studies focused mainly on ages beyond 18 years. Much is still unknown about the lead-lag relations between brain and cognitive development during childhood and adolescence. The present study addresses this issue by analyzing cognitive ability and cortical thickness Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -8 measured at three time points, in a sample of ages ranging from childhood to late adolescence, as detailed in the next section.</p></div>

This model underscores the relevance of several parietal and frontal brain regions when accounting for individual differences in intelligence, although temporal and occipital regions are also included within the P-FIT framework <ref type="bibr">(Pineda-Pardo, Martínez, Román, &amp; Colom, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Basten, Hilger, &amp; Fiebach (2015)</ref> noted the qualitative nature of the first version of the P-FIT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jung &amp; Haier, 2007)</ref> and, therefore, conducted one meta-analysis from published structural and functional neuroimaging studies. Interestingly, they distinguished the task and the individual differences approaches that were combined by Jung &amp; Haier. The latter approach is much more relevant for analyzing how intelligence differences relate to brain structural and functional differences: "the fact that a brain region is commonly activated (when solving a cognitive task) does not imply that individual differences in this activation are linked to individual differences in intelligence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Basten et al., 2015)</ref>. Although the meta-analytic results were generally consistent with the general P-FIT framework, they did not find any overlap between structural and functional correlates of intelligence differences. Thus, for instance, the parietal lobe was not identified in the meta-analysis of structural studies.</p><p>Previous literature (c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Haier, 2017)</ref> has pointed out that the conceptual approach in <ref type="bibr">Basten et al.'s (2015)</ref> might be helpful for studying the neurological basis Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -9 of intelligence. We hold that their meta-analysis implied one step further because their results are purely quantitative, in contrast to the rather qualitative approach in the P-FIT model. Because of this, here we focus on the regions identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Basten et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, we replicate all our analysis using the P-FIT regions.

The battery included the tests Vocabulary, Similarities, Matrix Reasoning, and Block Design. The same forms of all four tests were administered at the three time points considered.

Instead, we standardized the raw scores so they had mean = 0 and sd = 1 at the first measurement occasion.

For brevity, we refer to these composites as Cortical Thickness (CT) and Cortical Surface (CSA) We will report and compare the results for both types of brain measures.</p><p>----------------INSERT FIGURE <ref type="figure">1 HERE---------------</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(Ferrer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grimm, An, McArdle, Zonderman, &amp; Resnick, 2012</ref>).</p><p>1 For an easier interpretation, the four tests were rescaled onto z-scores with the first measurement occasion as the reference (mean = 0, sd = 1). In a strong measurement invariance specification, the loadings from the latent factor (λ) and the intercepts for the observed indicators (τ) are constrained to be invariant across time. The intercept of the latent factor is constrained to 0 in the first occasion and freely estimated in subsequent occasions. The residual variances for the indicators are freely estimated at each occasion. In our specification, these residuals were allowed to be auto-correlated within tests. Block design was used as the reference indicator. The loadings and intercepts of Matrices were allowed to be non-invariant -i.e., partial measurement invariance. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Meredith (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Meredith &amp; Horn (2001)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Widaman, Ferrer &amp; Conger (2010)</ref> for a detailed description of longitudinal measurement invariance testing.</p><p>The latent intercept y0, latent linear component ys, self-feedback β and , and couplings γ and  capture different relevant features of the trajectory, and therefore they must be interpreted together. The means of the latent intercepts capture the mean levels in both processes at the first measurement occasion. The means of the latent slopes capture the average increase between two occasions in each variable for the whole sample. The variances of these latent components capture individual differences in initial levels and rates change. The covariances between these latent components capture the linear relations between them.</p><p>We conducted a separate set of analyses for CT and for CSA. We used the measurement occasion as the time signature. Therefore, the trajectories were composed of three time-points per case and variable. To account for the linear and non-linear effects of age on the variables, we included age and the natural logarithm of age at first occasion as predictors of the latent intercepts. In addition, age was rescaled based on the youngest value (5.94 years), so the minimum was zero in the new scale. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts the LCS model for the two variables in each set of analyses.</p><p>----------------INSERT FIGURE <ref type="figure">2 HERE----------------</ref>We examined the relations in the development of cortex (Ctx) and g through a set of nested model comparisons. First (Model 1), we fitted a bivariate LCS model in which the two variables were allowed to have residual variance in the latent intercept (i.e., differences at time 1 are not explained just by individual differences in age). These residual variances were allowed to covary. The variances and covariances for latent linear components, covariances between latent initial levels and linear components, as well as the self-feedback and coupling parameters were constrained to zero (σgs = σCtx σgs-Ctxs = σg0-gs = σCtx0-Ctxs = σg0-Ctxs = σgs-Ctx0 = γg = γCtx = g = Ctx = g = Ctx = 0).</p><p>Then, we compared this model with a set of less restricted versions of it (Models 2 to 6) Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -15 in successive steps. Each comparison in the series allowed testing a specific hypothesis about the development of the two variables. Specifically, this procedure allows testing whether each additional freely estimated parameter contributes to increase the model fit -and, in consequence, to explain the observed trajectories (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for details).</p><p>Models were compared through likelihood ratio tests (p values lower than α=.05 were considered statistically significant), as well as inspection of the fit indices: model log likelihood, RMSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Steiger &amp; Lind, 1980)</ref>, CFI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bentler, 1990)</ref>, and Sample-Size Adjusted BIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Schwarz, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sclove, 1987)</ref>.

This result entails that the changes observed during the interval t2-t3 are a function of the level achieved at the Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -17 beginning of the interval, but such changes are better predicted when we take into consideration the changes in the same variable during the previous interval t1-t2 (Δg→Δg and ΔCtx→ΔCtx).</p><p>----------------INSERT TABLE <ref type="figure">3 HERE----------------</ref>Allowing non-zero level-to-change couplings (γCtx→Δg and γg→ΔCtx) in Model 3 did not lead to an increase in model fit. However, when we allowed the changes in each variable to be predicted by the changes in the other variable (i.e., change-to-change couplings ΔCtx→Δg and Δg→ΔCtx) in Model 4, we observed a significant increase in model fit (p&lt;.001 for both CT and CSA), with all fit indices supporting Model 4 over Models 3 and 2 in both datasets. These results strongly suggest that change in the variables is not predicted by the previous levels attained in the other variable, but by the change observed during the previous interval.</p><p>Allowing non-zero residual variances in the latent linear components of change, and a covariance between these residuals (Model 5), lead to a non-significant increase in model fit (p=.068 for CT, p=.084 for CSA). Model 6, which allowed non-zero covariances between latent intercepts and linear components, did not converge. In general, when a SEM model does not converge, it is not possible to draw inferences about the parameters in such model. However, non-converge is informative in the context of our nested model comparison. Model 6 did not converge, but the exact same model did converge when the covariances between the latent slopes and intercepts were constraint to zero (Model 5). Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the nonconvergence was due to the fact that the common pattern of variance in the trajectories of g and Ctx was fully explained by the lead-lag loadings. Because there was no more covariance left to be explained, the estimation algorithm did not find a minimum in the fit function for Model 6. In other words, this result may indicate that there is not enough Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -18 information in the empirical variance-covariance matrix for estimating the additional covariances in Model 6.</p><p>For both datasets, the Chi square test for nested model comparison showed that the additional parameters in Model 5 did not lead to a better fit than Model 4. Furthermore, RMSEA and aBIC were slightly better for Model 4, whereas CFI was only marginally better for Model 5. Overall, results shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> suggest that Model 4 better characterized the development in our sample. Therefore, we selected Model 4 for parameter interpretation. These results provide support for the idea that a) the development of cognitive ability is related with the development of both CT and CSA, b) lead-lag influences are relevant for this development processes, and c) recent changes are relevant for predicting subsequent changes. The results for the regions from the P-FIT model, and for the whole brain, were fairly consistent, and can be found in the supplemental materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Summary of findings</head><p>We sought to investigate the time-related associations between developmental cognitive changes (intelligence) and brain structural changes from childhood to early adulthood. We focused on average cortical thickness and surface area from a set of regions previously related with intelligence differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Basten et al., 2015)</ref>. Our primary goal was to investigate lead-lag effects between cognitive and biological developmental changes, as both processes unfold over time.</p><p>The key finding in our analysis is that cognitive ability and cortical thickness are mutually related over time. In particular, changes (and not current levels) in cognitive ability and cortical thickness in the considered regions predict subsequent changes in both variables. Although our models included level-to-change and change-to-change associations, only the latter appear to be relevant. In contrast, changes in cortical surface area predict changes in cognition, but are not predicted by the previous levels or rates of change in any variable. These lead-lag effects were found in a statistical model designed to capture effects of age as well as linear and nonlinear trends in the two variables of interest.</p><p>Interestingly, the increase in cognitive ability between the first and second measurement occasions was negatively related to changes in cortical thinning between the second and third measurement occasions -i.e., the effect cognition→thickness was negative. In contrast, the effects from thickness and surface to cognition were positive: individuals who experienced less thinning and surface loss showed more subsequent increase in cognitive abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -22</head><p>We also found significant and negative change-to-change self-feedback effects within cognitive abilities and thickness: larger cognitive ability gains between the first and second occasions were a significant predictor of modest ability gains from the second to the third occassions, and greater thinning predicted smaller subsequent thinning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Theoretical and methodological considerations</head><p>Biological maturation, as measured by age, is linked to changes in cortical structure and cognitive ability. Previous research has shown how both of them develop as individuals transition from childhood to adulthood <ref type="bibr">(Alemán-Gómez et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">McArdle et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou et al., 2015)</ref>. However, as described in our study, a significant part of the variance in the changes in cognition and cortical thickness appears to be explained by the previous changes experienced by the individuals.</p><p>Regarding the effects from cognition to brain, it is unclear why the changes in cognitive ability appear to predict subsequent changes in cortical thickness, but not in cortical surface area. These results may be partly explained by the fact that cortical surface area shows smaller -in fact, arguable-changes during the age range considered here. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou et al. (2015)</ref> there is substantial inconsistency in the published reports regarding cortical surface area changes across development. Thus, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wierenga et al. (2014), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schnack et al. (2015)</ref> reported surface area increases before age 10 years, 11 years, and by 15 years, respectively. In those reports, surface area decreases afterwards. However, Alemán-Gómez et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burgaleta et al. (2014)</ref> observed decreases in surface area within the 11-17 year range, or no change in surface area within the 6-20 year range, respectively. In clear contrast, cortical thinning is consistently found across the age range 7-22. Understanding individual differences in human cognition, and how such differ-Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -23 ences emerge over the life span, requires approaches that a) characterize the normative trajectories of cognitive and neural phenotypes and help to understand how these processes unfold in development, and b) investigate how genetics and experience affect the timing and shape of these curves. This knowledge may inform our conceptual models and provide clinically applicable insights into what factors drive human development (c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rosenberg, Casey, &amp; Holmes, 2018)</ref>. The present study is a step in that direction.</p><p>Our results suggest that the trajectories of both variables (cognitive and cortical) were adequately characterized by a bivariate LCS model. Change in these variables can be described as a function of: a) a linear additive rate of change, b) self-feedback effects, and c) coupling effects between general intelligence and cortical thickness.</p><p>The estimates from this model characterize a bivariate dynamic system that behaves very differently depending on its initial state. In other words, depending on the initial level of the two variables, the same parameters can lead to linear, nonlinear, increasing, decreasing or mixed tendencies for each of them. Because age is a predictor of the initial state, the model has considerable flexibility to capture different trajectories at different ages through its dynamic parameters. Furthermore, the linear and nonlinear effects of age on the additive components were able to pick up changes in the trajectories that were not captured by the dynamic parameters -including moderating effects of age. Interestingly, the couplings and self-feedbacks are significant in the presence of these complex age effects. This is consistent with the conclusion that the lead-lag associations detected are independent of age (within the range considered here).</p><p>Previous research has explored the influence of previous rates of change on subsequent changes. Indeed, the directionality 'brain to cognition' found here is consistent with studies conducted with elderly individuals. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jack et al. (2005)</ref> found that cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer disease were partially explained Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -24 by the previous rate (together with the previous level) of ventricle atrophy. However, our finding that cognitive changes predict cortical changes ('cognition → brain') is entirely novel and suggests that the interrelations of brain and cognitive development may follow different sequences in childhood and adolescence, compared to older ages. In other words, the relations between cortical and cognitive development may differ substantially at different moments across the human lifespan.</p><p>From a methodological perspective, the present research is one of the few investigating lead-lag effects from previous changes to later changes, even in the context of LCS models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ferrer et al. (2007)</ref> included these effects in their study of the developmental sequences between cognitive abilities and reading. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grimm et al. (2012)</ref> demonstrated how they can be specified in the context of LCS models. However, to the best of our knowledge, the present research is the first to incorporate these effects for investigating the relations between cognitive and cortical development.</p><p>Previous studies (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wendelken et al., 2017)</ref> did not analyze simultaneous effects of reasoning on cortical change -i.e., changes in reasoning were the only variable considered as "dependent" in their linear regression model. The present study is the first investigation of reciprocal lead-lag effects between cognitive ability and brain structural differences. The finding that the previous rate of change -and not the previous level achieved-predicts subsequent changes is a novel contribution to the developmental literature. These results underscore the importance of including both cortical and cognitive changes as part of the same dynamic system, in order to identify the relevant effects in the presence of all the other effects within the system.</p><p>Considering only two of the three measurement occasions analyzed here, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burgaleta et al. (2014)</ref> found that gains in Full Scale IQ were negatively associated with cortical thinning: the larger the IQ gain, the greater the thickness preservation. The present Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -25 work differs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burgaleta et al.'s (2014)</ref> in the following points: a) we considered three waves of data, instead of two, which allows a more reliable measure of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Willett, 1989)</ref>; b) we went beyond a correlational approach and investigated timelagged associations in the presence of a system of reciprocal influences; and c) we estimated our variables as latent factors, which allows separating the true variance in the latent construct from the variance due to measurement error -included in the IQ estimate. Because our model included lead-lag effects (from brain structure to cognition and vice-versa), instead of mere correlations, we were able to find a positive effect indicating that less thinning was predictive of larger subsequent intelligence gains (consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burgaleta et al.'s, 2014)</ref>, but a negative effect showing that larger intelligence gains predicted greater subsequent thinning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Possible implications for brain plasticity and cognitive enhancement</head><p>The finding that intellectual changes and cortical changes reciprocally predict each other could have implications for attempts aimed at enhancing cognitive ability. As underscored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Haier (2017)</ref> "the ultimate purpose of all intelligence research is to enhance intelligence". There is now a growing discussion regarding efficient ways for achieving this goal <ref type="bibr">(Au et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Au, Buschkuehl, Duncan, &amp; Jaeggi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Colom &amp; Román, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Melby-Lervåg &amp; Hulme, 2016)</ref>, or even questioning if this is possible at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sala, Tatlidil, &amp; Gobet, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Simons et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that individuals with higher intelligence scores are systematically more engaged in intellectually demanding activities, and this contributes to keep brain integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Flynn, 2016)</ref>. For instance, studying the 1936 Lothian Birth Cohort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Karama et al. (2014)</ref> found that childhood IQ (measured at age 11 years) explains more than two-third of the relation between the IQ assessed at age 70 and cortical thickness at age 73. These researchers discuss three alternatives for explaining the finding: (a) genes associated with intelligence in childhood are the same genes associated with intelligence in old age, (b) individuals with higher intelligence scores are systematically more engaged in intellectually demanding activities and this contributes to keep brain integrity, and (c) reciprocal dynamic associations between cortical thickness and intelligence. The second and third alternatives are consistent with our finding that changes in cognitive abilities predict subsequent cortical changes. In our sample, children and adolescents involved in more cognitively demanding activities may have accelerated their natural process of cognitive development and achieved a higher rate of change. In turn, this fastest rate of change may have led to changes in the regions of the cortex expected to be related with intelligence according to the brain regions highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Basten et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>In the same vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Protzko (2015)</ref> conducted a meta-analysis on the fadeout effects systematically observed after the cessation of intelligence enhancement programs.</p><p>He concluded that this fadeout effect is an inevitable consequence of the return to an impoverished environment. In light of our results, we suggest that the fadeout effect may be due to the inability of the enhancement programs to evoke and preserve actual changes in the individual's cortices. Such morphological changes may be achieved only when the intellectual enhancement is fast enough -i.e., the amount of improvement during a given period of time is sufficiently large-to trigger reorganization in the cortex. It must be noted that this hypothesis is based solely on the correlational -although longitudinal-data of our research. Stronger evidence can be provided only by experimental studies applying programs that cause different rates of enhancement in different groups, and then comparing subsequent rates of cortical change between such groups.</p></div>

Namely, we found individual differences in the direction of the longitudinal change: contrary to the general thinning trend, approximately 21% of cases experienced cortical thickening. Similarly, around 50% of the sample showed cortical surface are increases during the study. These individual differences had a weak relation to age (for cortical surface), or no relation at all (for cortical thickness). Future research should investigate the between-individual characteristics related to this variability in change.</p><p>For example, recent research has shown that pubertal onset may be an important factor for cortical development, beyond the effect of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Herting, Gautam, Spielberg, Dahl, &amp; Sowell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Herting &amp; Sowell, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Juraska &amp; Willing, 2017)</ref>. The results from these studies suggest that sex differences in the production of hormones (particularly gonadal steroids; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Juraska &amp; Willing, 2017)</ref>, together with individual differences in pubertal timing, may lead to different patterns of cortical reorganization in each person.</p><p>Future research should investigate differences between males and females, and the role of puberty onset in the joint cognitive and cortical development. Studies including hormonal markers may help understanding the lead-lag sequences found in the present study, and search for differential cascade effects for boys and girls.</p><p>Relying on previous research, we have focused on a set of cortical regions studying whether cortical changes over time are associated with cognitive changes. It is possible that there is regional and functional specificity. For example, it is reasonable to think -and previous evidence suggests so-that the interrelations between cognitive and brain development may be even stronger for subsets of ROIs in the <ref type="bibr">Basten et al. system (Pineda-Pardo et al., 2016)</ref>. Finding patterns of regional specificity falls beyond the scope of this study and should be explored in future research. In a similar vein, the present findings do not provide enough evidence to think that the associations found are Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -28 specific to the Basten set. Indeed, we found consistent results both for a set of regions identified in the P-FIT framework, and for the average CT and CSA for the whole brain (see supplementary materials). Similarly, including other neuroimaging measures, such as connectivity, or functional brain data from fMRI, will likely help understanding the interplay between the development of cognitive abilities and the relevant biological features involved.</p><p>Here we considered general cognitive ability. It would also be interesting to investigate the interplay between specific cognitive abilities -e.g., abstract reasoning, verbal ability, processing speed, working memory capacity-and brain development in those regions expected to be associated with them, and evaluate whether the results reported here are replicated with greater levels of granularity -i.e., Do increases in specific abilities predict cortical thinning in the relevant brain regions?</p><p>We chose a logarithmic transformation of age to account for potential nonlinear effects. However, other transformations of age could be suitable as well. Finding the most appropriate transformation of age for this type of developmental processes is an interesting research question that requires a formal investigation beyond the scope of the present study. Along the same lines, our selected model is -as every statistical model-a constrained representation of the phenomenon under study. As such, the excellent fit achieved does not imply that we were able to detect all possible age-related and developmental effects in the data.</p><p>Recent advances in continuous time modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Driver, Oud, &amp; Voelkle, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Estrada &amp; Ferrer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ji &amp; Chow, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ou, Hunter, &amp; Chow, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Voelkle &amp; Oud, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Voelkle, Oud, Davidov, &amp; Schmidt, 2012)</ref> allow a wide variety of possibilities for the study of dynamic systems. Applying these analytic frameworks could provide rich information about how the lead-lag effects between brain structure and cognitive ability change as a function of the time lag. Specifically, previous research has shown that different time sampling -and, therefore, different time lags-can lead to the identification of different self-feedback and coupling effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Deboeck &amp; Preacher, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Voelkle et al., 2012)</ref>. In our study, the time lag between measurement occasions was approximately two years for all participants and measures. This was due to the specific sampling schedule applied for acquiring the data. It is unknown whether the effects found here are due to the actual time-course of neurological pathways -i.e., reciprocal effects become manifest after approximately two years-, or they are due to working with these specific time lags. Continuous time models may help detecting more complex patterns of sequential effects for different time lags. On the other hand, the literature regarding these models is still scarce, and some features of our discrete time LCS -such as a measurement model with longitudinal factor invariance, or parameters capturing changes-tochanges influences-are not easy to implement in the current continuous time frameworks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Conclusion</head><p>The key finding from the present research supports the general conclusion that individual differences in the changes in cognitive ability and cortical structure are partly explained by individual differences in their previous rates of change, and not their previous levels. Cognitive improvement is decelerated by previous cognitive improvements, but accelerated by cortical thinning and cortical surface reduction. In turn, cortical thinning is accelerated by previous cognitive gains. Based on this, we hypothesize that the (cross-sectional) associations found in previous studies might reflect reciprocal cascade effects from behavior to the neocortex and vice-versa.</p><p>These results suggest that, at least from childhood to early adulthood, we should pay attention not only to how able individuals become, but also to how fast they reach such cognitive level. Much is still unknown about what variables can explain the individual differences in the rate of cognitive improvement and cortical development. Some possible factors include genetic pathways, hormonal processes, brain features such as connectivity, or influences from the environment. Regarding the latter, the findings reported here may be helpful for designing environments able to foster sustainable increases in cognitive ability. Specifically, future programs designed for cognitive enhancement should test whether faster changes lead to stronger cortical reorganization, which, in turn, prevents subsequent fadeout effects. Note: Total n = 420. 47.7% females, 42.8% males. All the scores were standardized with the first occasion as the reference (mean = 0, sd = 1).   Note: Scores rescaled so they have mean=0 and sd=1 at time 1.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>In short, there is a lack of fine-grained information about how the relations between intellectual and cortical development work, and what are their time-lagged sequences.

See also Ferrer &amp; McArdle, 2010, for a detailed revision of LCS applications to different research domains). Among other advantages, these models allow: a) isolating measurement errorsand other sources of non-relevant variance-from the true variance in the studied variables, b) detecting sequences of -i.e., lead-lag-effects within and between the different variables of interest, and c) formally describing developmental trajectories with very different shapes, including increasing, decreasing, decelerated and explosive phenomena. LCS models have been applied to investigate the relations between intellectual and cortical development. Most studies on this topic have focused on the association between cognitive decline and brain changes during later age. For example, McArdle et al. (2004) used LCS for studying the relations between change in lateral ventricles size and memory decline in adults aged 30-80 years at baseline. They found that the decrease in lateral ventricular size was a leading indicator of memory declines. Raz et al. (2008) investigated the relation of fluid intelligence and brain volume in a sample of adults. However, associations in the rates of change were not perceptible. Lövdén et al. Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -7 (2014) used two repeated measures of white matter microstructure and several cognitive abilities in a sample of adults aged 81-103 years. They found that alterations of white matter microstructure in the corticospinal tract were associated with decreases in perceptual speed. Studying elderly individuals, Ritchie et al. (2015) found that longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure (indexed by fractional anisotropy, FA) were coupled with changes in fluid intelligence, but not with processing speed or memory. Studying the same sample, Anblagan et al. (2018) focused on the relation between hippocampal structure and declines in cognitive ability. They found that better hippocampal mean diffusivity at age 73 predict less decline in verbal memory, working memory and processing speed three years later. Kievit et al. (2017) demonstrated how to use LCS for a) detecting correlated change in brain and behavior in the context of a training intervention in a lifespan study, and b) characterizing differences between boys and girls in cortical development during adolescence. Bender, Prindle, Brandmaier &amp; Raz (2016) found that longitudinal improvements in associative memory were significantly associated with linear reductions in FA and increases in radial diffusivity, in a sample of healthy adults from 18 to 79 years.</figDesc></figure>

They found: (a) substantial increments in intelligence scores estimated at the latent level, (b) statistically significant correlations between cortical changes (thickness and surface area) and intelligence changes, (c) as individuals grow older, cortical and intelligence changes were smaller, and (d) individuals with higher intelligence scores showed cortical thickness preservation at early adolescence. Nevertheless, Román et al. analyzed the correlation between simultaneous changes only, and they acknowledged that their findings "cannot tell if intelligence modulates cortical changes or the other way around". The present investigation aims to extend what it is already known by focusing on this very issue. Therefore, we (a) characterize the trajectories and intra-individual change in cognitive ability, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area, and (b) investigate the relations between these variables, and particularly their lead-lagged associations. Because simultaneous change was studied in previous literature, the question addressed here is: Does the development in cortical thickness or cortical surface drive cognitive development? Does cognitive development drive brain development? Do both processes exert reciprocal influences, as they unfold over time? Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -10 2.

Analysis We specified a common latent factor (g) representing general mental ability, measured by the four cognitive tests.

In our study, we specified such changes are a function of: a) an additive linear component, adding the same amount each occasion 2 , and captured by ys, b) the latent levels at the previous occasion, both from the variable itself -i.e., self-feedback level to change, βy-, and the other variable -coupling level to change, γy-, and c) the latent change during the previous interval, both from the variable -self-feedback change to change y-, and the other variable -coupling change to change y. The latter change-to-change parameters are an interesting but infrequent extension of the classical LCS specification</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>-Time-lagged associations between cognitive and cortical development -16 Considering CT, 29 cases experienced thickening from t1 to t3 (20.9% of 139 cases with both time points, mean Age1 = 11.02 years, sdAge1=4.3), whereas 110 cases experienced thinning (79.1%, mean Age1 = 11.65 years, sdAge1=3.27). Considering CSA, 68 cases experienced an increase (48.9%, mean Age1 = 10.61 years, sdAge1=3.56) and 71 cases experienced decrease (51.1%, mean Age1 = 12.4 years, sdAge1=3.24). Cortical thinning was not associated with younger ages at first occasion: Pearson correlation of r = -.07 (p=.431). In contrast, surface change was negatively associated with younger ages: r = -.28 (p&lt;.001, i.e., older age was weakly associated with surface decrease). In any case, these correlations were very close to zero, and both increases and decreases were observed in individuals across the whole age range.</figDesc></figure>

Both cortical measures have positive effects: individuals who experienced less thinning and less surface loss during the previous interval showed more subsequent increase in g. d) Importantly, change in thickness is negatively predicted by previous change in g: individuals who increased more in g during the previous interval showed greater subsequent thinning. e) However, change in cortical surface is not predicted by previous change in either itself or g -i.e., change in CSA is not predicted by previous levels or rates of change in the system.</figDesc></figure>
