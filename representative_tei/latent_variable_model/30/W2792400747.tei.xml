<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents a Bayesian framework for under-determined audio source separation in multichannel reverberant mixtures. We model the source signals as Student's t latent random variables in a time-frequency domain. The specific structure of musical signals in this domain is exploited by means of a non-negative matrix factorization model. Conversely, we design the mixing model in the time domain. In addition to leading to an exact representation of the convolutive mixing process, this approach allows us to develop simple probabilistic priors for the mixing filters. Indeed, as those filters correspond to room responses they exhibit a simple characteristic structure in the time domain that can be used to guide their estimation. We also rely on the Student's t distribution for modeling the impulse response of the mixing filters. From this model, we develop a variational inference algorithm in order to perform source separation. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the potential of this approach for separating multichannel reverberant mixtures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A UDIO source separation consists in recovering a set of audio source signals from the observation of a mixture signal. In music, we usually encounter stereophonic mixtures (recorded with two microphones) involving more than two sources, leading to an under-determined source separation problem. Moreover, musical acoustic recordings are usually done in a reverberant environment, the mixing process is said to be convolutive in that case. This work aims to address the under-determined source separation problem for multichannel musical reverberant mixtures.</p><p>In this section, before introducing our contributions that will be further developed in the rest of the paper, we first review some of the related source and mixing models that have been proposed in the literature for solving the audio source separation problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Source Modeling</head><p>Audio source separation methods commonly work with a time-frequency (TF) representation of the source signals. Audio signals are indeed much sparser in the TF domain than in the original time-domain, which facilitates the development of a source model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Sparse component analysis methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for instance make use of sparsity inducing penalties <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or super-Gaussian distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for modeling the source signals, assuming independent and identically distributed TF source coefficients.</p><p>In order to take more complex TF structures into account, another approach referred to as the variance modeling framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was introduced. It consists in modeling the TF source coefficients by means of a non-stationary probability distribution. In the Gaussian case and under a local stationarity assumption of the source signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, this approach amounts to modeling the short-term power spectral density (PSD) of the source signals, represented by the variance of the TF source coefficients.</p><p>For instance, a piece of music is generally composed of musical events that repeat over time such as tonal musical notes or percussive sounds. This redundant structure can be represented within the variance modeling framework, by means of a compositional model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). A Gaussian generative model based on a non-negative decomposition of the short-term PSD of audio signals was first introduced in the single-channel source separation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This model was then further developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> where the equivalence between maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters and NMF with the Itakura-Saito divergence was proven. In the recent literature many different probability distributions have been studied for audio signal modeling based on NMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Even though those NMF-based probabilistic models were introduced for single-channel audio source separation, they were rapidly used for multichannel audio source separation as well, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>We can also mention that deep neural networks were recently introduced within the variance modeling framework for multichannel audio source separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This work illustrates the promising approach of building methods using supervised source modeling and unsupervised convolutive mixture modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Convolutive Mixture Modeling</head><p>Under-determined source separation becomes even more challenging when the mixture is reverberant. When a punctual source is emitting sound in an enclosed space, the signal recorded by the microphone is equal to the convolution of the source signal with a room impulse response (RIR). This RIR characterizes the acoustic path between the two points in the room. In the context of audio source separation, the RIRs associated with every pair source-microphone are referred to as the mixing filters.</p><p>More formally, let s j (t) ∈ R, t = 0, ..., L s -1, j = 1, ..., J, be the j-th source signal and a ij (t) ∈ R, t = 0, ..., L a -1, i = 1, ..., I, the impulse response of the mixing filter between source j and microphone i. We define the j-th source image as seen by the i-th microphone for t = 0, ..., T -1 with T = L s + L a -1 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y ij (t) = [a ij s j ](t) = La-1 τ =0</formula><p>a ij (τ )s j (t -τ ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where the source signal is zero outside of the support {0, ..., L s -1}. The signal recorded by microphone i is defined as the sum of the source images:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x i (t) = J j=1 y ij (t).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A large number of source separation methods also work with a TF representation of the mixture signal. It is very common to rely on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) because it allows us to approximate the time-domain convolution as a simple multiplication in each frequency band of the STFT:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y ij,f n = a ij,f s j,f n ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where a ij,f ∈ C is the frequency response of the mixing filter and s j,f n , y ij,f n ∈ C are the STFT coefficients of s j (t) and y ij (t) respectively, at the TF point (f, n) where f denotes the frequency index and n the time-frame index. Such an approach has for example been followed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> along with a Gaussian NMF-based source model. However, the approximation in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) is only valid when the mixing filters are shorter than the STFT analysis window <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The length of the mixing filters is usually considered to be equal to the reverberation time, denoted by T 60 and defined as the time it takes for the sound energy to decrease by 60 dB after extinction of the source. The reverberation time in domestic or office rooms usually varies between 0.1 and 0.8 s, while for concert halls it can be as high as 2 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. On the contrary the length of the STFT window is typically short (between 30 and 120 ms) in order to assume the local stationarity of the source signals over the temporal support of the STFT window. Therefore, the approximation in (3) is limited to very weakly reverberant mixtures. This is precisely the reason why other mixture models have been investigated in the literature. A Gaussian multichannel source image model based on a spatial covariance matrix was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to represent nonpunctual sources. It was shown to overcome to some extent the limitations of the approximation (3). This spatial covariance matrix model was used along with an NMF-based source model in the multichannel source separation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> it was demonstrated that the time-domain convolution can be exactly expressed as a two-dimensional filtering in a TF domain based on any perfect reconstruction filter bank. This representation is called cross-band filtering (CBF) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> when the filter bank corresponds to the STFT. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the time-domain convolution is approximated as a sub-band filtering in the STFT domain. This approach is equivalent to neglecting the relationships between the frequency bands in the CBF representation. It is referred to as the convolutive transfer function (CTF) model in the recent source separation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> directly worked with the time-domain mixture signals in order to exactly represent the convolutive mixing process, but in a limited semi-blind scenario where the mixing filters were known. We also followed this time-domain approach in previous works. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the sources were represented in the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) domain. Each TF coefficient was modeled as a centered Gaussian random variable whose variance was structured by means of an NMF model. The time-domain mixing filters were treated as deterministic parameters that had to be estimated, however they were initialized in an oracle fashion. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> we extended this approach by using a Student's t distribution for modeling the source MDCT coefficients <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . We considered a semi-blind setting assuming that the mixing filters were known and fixed. Finally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> we generalized our approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to a source representation based on the STFT. Again the experiments were performed knowing the true mixing filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Contributions</head><p>Apart from leading to an exact representation of the convolutive mixing process, working with time-domain mixing filters allows us to design simple probabilistic priors. Indeed, as the mixing filters correspond to RIRs, they exhibit a simple specific structure in the time domain that can be used to guide their estimation. In an under-determined context, being able to exploit some additional information is a very important aspect. For example, it has been shown that taking this specific temporal structure into account is useful for the estimation of multiple RIRs in a non-blind (knowing the source signals) and potentially under-determined (more RIR samples than observed mixture samples) setting <ref type="bibr">[38] [39,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 5]</ref>.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the source separation methods in the literature that represented the convolutive mixing process in the time domain depended on the true mixing filters. This scenario was restrictive because in a real-world application it is difficult to have this knowledge. The main contribution of the present paper is to propose a new Bayesian framework where the mixing filters are treated as latent random variables in the time domain. We introduce a probabilistic modeling of the mixing filters using the Student's t distribution. It generalizes a widely used Gaussian model in statistical room acoustics. We also formulate the source model so that different TF resolutions can be used to characterize different sources in the mixture. Finally the experiments are carried out in a more realistic scenario as we do not assume that the mixing filters are known.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the source and mixing models. The variational inference algorithm is derived in Section III. We detail the experimental results in Section IV and finally conclude in Section V.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Source Time-Frequency Representation</head><p>The source signals are represented by a set of TF synthesis coefficients {s j,f n ∈ R} (f,n)∈Bj with B j = {0, ..., F j -1} × {0, ..., N j -1} as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s j (t) = (f,n)∈Bj s j,f n φ j,f n (t).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We work with the MDCT, such that for all (f, n) ∈ B j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">φ j,f n (t) = 4 M j w j (t -nH j ) cos 2π M j t -nH j + 1 2 + M j 4 f + 1 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where w j (t) is a sine window of length M j , H j = M j /2 is the hop size and F j = M j /2 is the number of frequency bins. Note that in this representation the window length is sourcedependent. This specificity allows us to adapt the TF resolution according to the sources in the mixture. For example we can choose a short window for drums, resulting in a good time resolution, and a longer window for tonal instruments such as the guitar, resulting in a good frequency resolution.</p><p>Any TF dictionary could be chosen in the source representation (4) (MDCT, STFT, unions of MDCT, ...). Here we choose to work with the MDCT because it is critically sampled. Compared with the STFT which is redundant, it allows us to reduce the number of source TF coefficients to be estimated and therefore to reduce the computational load. Moreover we experimentally showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> that using the STFT does not improve the source separation performance, according to a perceptually motivated objective measure. We can also mention that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> it has been shown that the MDCT is more suitable than the STFT for assuming the independence of the TF points, which is a common assumption in probabilistic approaches for audio source separation.</p><p>According to this TF representation, a source image as defined in (1) can be rewritten with g ij,f n (t) = [a ij φ j,f n ](t) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y ij (t) = (f,n)∈Bj s j,f n g ij,f n (t).<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Student's t Distribution</head><p>Under-determined reverberant audio source separation is an ill-posed problem in the sense that the solution is not unique; an infinite number of solutions for the source signals and the mixing filters can explain the same observed mixture. It is therefore necessary to introduce some information in order to guide the source separation process. In a Bayesian perspective, it consists in defining probabilistic priors over the source coefficients s = {s j,f n } j,f,n and the mixing filters a = {a ij (t)} i,j,t . The priors should be informative in order to express some specific belief about these unknown quantities. Compared with deterministic models which would strictly restrict the possible values for the unobserved set of variables s and a, using probabilistic priors allows us to take uncertainty about the model into account. As both priors on the TF source coefficients and the time-domain mixing filters will rely on the Student's t distribution, we first introduce it in this subsection before presenting the priors in the following ones.</p><p>Let T α (µ, λ) denote the Student's t distribution over a realvalued random variable (r.v.) where µ ∈ R is the location parameter, α ∈ ]0, +∞[ is the shape parameter (also called degrees of freedom) and λ ∈ ]0, +∞[ is the scale parameter. Its probability density function (pdf) is defined in Appendix A, equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. The Student's t distribution can be expressed as a scale mixture of Gaussians (SMoG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> by introducing a positive real-valued inverse-gamma r.v. v:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x ∼ T α (µ, λ) ⇔ v ∼ IG α 2 , α 2 ; x|v ∼ N (µ, vλ 2 ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The pdfs of the Gaussian and inverse-gamma distributions are defined in Appendix A, equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_69">50</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_71">51</ref>) respectively. The Student's t distribution is a super-Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> which exhibits thicker tails than the Gaussian as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As α tends to infinity the Student's t distribution approaches the Gaussian one, while smaller values of α yield heavier tails. The particular case α = 1 corresponds to the Cauchy distribution. Informally speaking, the SMoG representation of the Student's t distribution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> can be interpreted in the following way: realizations of x are globally expected to be distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. However the overall variance λ 2 is scaled by realizations of the inverse-gamma variable v, which most of the time remain small (the mode of the distribution being α/(α + 2)), but may sometimes get significantly large, accounting for outliers or high uncertainty in the model with respect to the Gaussian assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Prior for the Sources</head><p>In the generative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the TF source coefficients are assumed to independently follow a centered Gaussian distribution: s j,f n ∼ N (0, λ 2 j,f n ). The variances are further structured by means of an NMF model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">λ 2 j,f n = [W j H j ] f n ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W j ∈ R Fj ×Kj + and H j ∈ R Kj ×Nj +</formula><p>. K j is the rank of the factorization and is chosen such that K j (F j + N j ) F j N j . W j is a matrix containing spectral templates and H j contains the activations of these templates over the time frames.</p><p>This model was originally proposed for a source representation based on the complex-valued STFT. The source coefficients s j,f n were consequently represented as circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. However it can be used similarly for a source representation based on the real-valued MDCT as already proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> for informed source separation. Note that if we observe a set of realizations of this Gaussian source model denoted by {s j,f n } f,n , it can be shown that the maximum likelihood estimation of the NMF parameters is obtained by minimizing the Itakura-Saito divergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> between |s j,f n | 2 and [W j H j ] f n .</p><p>This generative Gaussian source model has then led to several extensions based on other probability distributions. In particular, heavy-tailed distributions such that the Cauchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the symmetric alpha-stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the Student's t <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> have been investigated. The flexibility induced by these heavy-tailed distributions allows the expected source power to strongly deviate from the NMF source model. Indeed, in the Gaussian case the source coefficients s j,f n are expected to lie just within a few standard deviations λ j,f n from the mean. On the contrary, a heavy-tailed source model allows for larger deviations due to the thicker tails of the distribution. This flexibility can be useful when the NMF source model is a misfit due to inaccurate parameter estimation or because of the nature of the source which is not well represented by an NMF model. The superiority of these heavy-tailed distributions for modeling audio signals along with NMF has already been reported in this literature, in particular for single channel audio separation of rank-1 sources using a Student's t NMF observation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>We propose here to model the individual source signals with this Student's t NMF model. We assume that the TF source coefficients s j,f n independently follow a Student's t distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">s j,f n ∼ T αv (0, λ j,f n ).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>As explained in the previous subsection, this model is equivalent to the following hierarchical one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">s j,f n |v j,f n ∼ N (0, v j,f n λ 2 j,f n ); v j,f n ∼ IG α v 2 , α v 2 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>We further assume that the squared scale parameters are structured by means of an NMF model as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. The choice of α v regarding the source separation results will be discussed in the experimental part of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Prior for the Mixing Filters 1) Statistical Room Acoustics:</head><p>The mixing filters introduced in (1) for representing a source image are actually RIRs that are supposed to be related to a same acoustic space (a room with its specific acoustical properties). Therefore we drop the source and microphone indices in this subsection and an RIR in the acoustical environment where the mixture is recorded will be denoted by a(t). It will allow us to clarify the model presentation.</p><p>We represent in the top plot of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> the first 400 ms of an RIR ã(t) from the MIRD database <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. This RIR was recorded in a room with a reverberation time of 610 ms. The source-to-microphone distance was approximately 2 m. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Amplitude (top), power (middle) and normalized power (bottom) of the first 400 ms of an RIR from the MIRD database <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The RIR was recorded in a room with a reverberation time of 610 ms and with a sourceto-microphone distance of 2 m.</p><p>An RIR is usually divided into two main parts: (1) the early contributions that include the direct path between the source and the microphone and the early echoes coming from the first significant reflections on the boundaries and objects in the room; (2) the late reverberation. The time instant that separates the early contributions from the late reverberation is usually called mixing time. It is common to assume that late reverberation corresponds to a stage of the propagation where the sound field is diffuse, i.e. the energy density is uniformly distributed across the room and over all directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The middle plot of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the power in decibels (dB) of this RIR. We see that globally, the power decays exponentially over time (or equivalently linearly in dB units). In statistical room acoustics, an RIR is usually modeled as a centered random process such that a(t) is a random variable. For a proper choice of probability distribution, the exponential decay property then relates to the variance E[a 2 (t)] [47], <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. It is important to mention that different realizations from a statistical RIR model can be interpreted as different observations with varying source and microphone positions in a same room. Mathematical expectation has thus to be understood as spatial averaging.</p><p>2) Gaussian Model with Exponential Decay: Moorer noticed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> that concert halls impulse responses sound very similarly to white noise with an exponentially decaying envelope. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, Polack introduced a widely used model in statistical room acoustics that formalized this observation. In this model an RIR is represented as a non-stationary centered Gaussian random process such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">a(t) ∼ N (0, r 2 (t))<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">r(t) = σ r exp(-t/τ ), τ = T 60 f s 3 ln(10) .

In this model, the room frequency response is represented as a random process whose real and imaginary parts are independent centered and stationary Gaussian processes with the same variance.</p><p>3) Preliminary Experiment: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> Polack concluded that RIRs can be represented by means of statistical processes only after the mixing time, when the echo density is large enough. The Gaussian model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>) is therefore theoretically valid only for the diffuse part of the RIR which corresponds to late reverberation.</p><p>We represent in the bottom plot of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> the normalized power ã2 (t)/ exp(-2t/τ ) in order to compensate for the exponential decay. The decay factor τ is fixed according to (12) using the knowledge of the reverberation time. We observe that the normalized power is indeed almost constant over time. However there are some strong deviations at the beginning of the RIR due to the direct path and early echoes.</p><p>We now propose to experimentally verify the validity of the Gaussian model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. For that purpose we use RIRs from the MIRD database <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, that were recorded in a room with a reverberation time of 610 ms using 3 arrays of 8 microphones for 26 different source positions. It results in a total number of 624 RIRs, that we first normalize by exp(-t/τ ) in order to compensate for the exponential decay (we know the reverberation time). The empirical pdf of this set of normalized RIR coefficients is represented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (black solid line). According to the standard Gaussian model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) we have a(t)/ exp(-t/τ ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 r ), so those normalized RIR coefficients are supposed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) realizations of N (0, σ 2 r ). Therefore, from this set of i.i.d data points, we estimate the mean and the variance of a Gaussian distribution in the maximum likelihood sense. We represent with a blue dotted line in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> the pdf of this Gaussian distribution, using the estimated values of the parameters (the estimated σ r is 0.006 and the mean is almost zero). We clearly observe that the empirical distribution has thicker tails than the Gaussian. This is due to the direct path and the early echoes of the RIRs. Statistically speaking, they act as outliers with respect to the Gaussian model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) as already noticed from the bottom plot of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>4) Student's t Model with Exponential Decay: This is precisely the reason why we propose to use the Student's t distribution. Indeed its robustness with respect to outliers allows us to take those strong deviations into account. To experimentally demonstrate this point, we also estimate the parameters of a Student's t distribution, using the exact same data as before. The maximum likelihood estimation leads to σ r = 0.005 and a shape parameter that is equal to 7.2, the location parameter is again very close to zero. The pdf of the Student's t distribution, using the estimated parameters, is represented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> with a red dashed line. We clearly observe that the Student's t is a better choice for modeling RIRs.</p><p>5) Proposed Prior for the Mixing Filters: According to the previous discussion and preliminary experiment, we assume that the mixing filter coefficients a ij (t) independently follow a Student's t distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">a ij (t) ∼ T αu (0, r(t)),<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where r(t) models the exponential decay as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. This model admits Polack's Gaussian one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> as a special case when α u → ∞. It can be rewritten in a hierarchical manner as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">a ij (t)|u ij (t) ∼ N 0, u ij (t)r 2 (t) ; u ij (t) ∼ IG α u 2 , α u 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. VARIATIONAL INFERENCE Let us define the following sets of latent variables:</head><formula xml:id="formula_19">s = {s j,f n } j,f,n ; v = {v j,f n } j,f,n ; a = {a ij (t)} i,j,t ; u = {u ij (t)} i,j,t and z = {s, v, a, u}.

However exact posterior inference with the proposed model is analytically intractable. We thus resort to approximate inference using a variational approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Let F denote a set of pdfs over the latent variables z. For any parameter set θ, variational inference aims to find the pdf q in the variational family F that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the true posterior: where D KL (q(z)||p(z|x; θ)) = ln (q(z)/p(z|x; θ)) q and &lt; • &gt; q denotes the mathematical expectation taken with respect to q. From the definition of the KL divergence we can show that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">q (z) = arg min q(z)∈F D KL (q(z)||p(z|x; θ)),<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">D KL (q(z)||p(z|x; θ)) = ln p(x; θ) -L(q; θ),<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where ln p(x; θ) is the marginal log-likelihood and L(q; θ) is the variational free energy (VFE), also called evidence lower bound, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">L(q; θ) = ln (p(x, z; θ)/q(z)) q . (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>ln p(x, z; θ) is referred to as the complete data log-likelihood.</p><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> we see that minimizing the KL divergence with respect to q(z) is equivalent to maximizing the VFE. Moreover, as the KL divergence is always non-negative, we see that the VFE is a lower bound of the marginal loglikelihood. In this work we will use the variational expectationmaximization (VEM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> which consists in iterating two steps until convergence: the E-step where we compute q = arg max q∈F L(q; θ ) and the M-step where we compute θ = arg max θ L(q ; θ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Mean-Field Approximation</head><p>In practice we have to assume some constraints on the variational family F for solving the E-step.

Conjugate-Exponential Model</head><p>The model defined in Section II and represented as a Bayesian network in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> is said to be conjugateexponential <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Indeed, the distribution of each latent variable, conditionally on its parents, belongs to the exponential family and the distributions of its parents are conjugate with respect to it. As a consequence of this exponential-conjugacy property, it can be shown that under the mean-field approximation, the optimal variational distribution q (z), z ∈ z, will have the same form as the prior distribution of z conditionally on its parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. E-Step</head><p>Multiple choices are possible for solving this optimization problem. The most popular approach is referred to as coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. It consists in maximizing the VFE by cycling over each individual scalar variational parameter. We can indeed show that the optimal distribution q (z), z ∈ z, should satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">ln q (z) = ln p(x, z; θ) q(z\z) + constant, (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">)</formula><p>where z\z denotes the set of all latent variables but z. This technique aims to identify the distribution of the individual factors q (z) along with the expression of its parameters by developing the right hand side of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Every term that does not depend on z can be injected in the constant. In this way it can be shown that the expectation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> only involves the random variables belonging to the Markov blanket M B(z) of z, i.e. its parents, children and co-parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. This inference method therefore leads to a set of coupled solutions, as the variational parameters for q (z) will depend on the variational parameters of the distributions of the variables in M B(z).</p><p>Due to a lot of potential coupling, this cyclical approach can lead to a very slow inference procedure. One possible way of speeding up the algorithm is to directly update groups of variational parameters by using gradient-based approaches.</p><p>Because of the Gaussian nature of the variational distributions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">23</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">25</ref>), we have to solve two quadratic and convex optimization problems to individually update the sets of variational parameters {ŝ j,f n } j,f,n and {â ij (t)} i,j,t (see the form of the VFE defined in Appendix B). For that purpose we will use the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, which was already considered for variational inference in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. For all other variational parameters, that are ν v , ν u , {β j,f n , γ j,f n } j,f,n and {d ij (t), ρ ij (t)} i,j,t , we will use the standard coordinate-wise updating procedure, relying on <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, which except for ν v and ν u is equivalent to canceling the partial derivatives of the VFE <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> .</p><p>The updates of the variational parameters for solving the E-step are detailed below.</p><p>1) E-V Step: We can develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> for the latent variable v j,f n as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">ln q (v j,f n ) c = -ln(v j,f n ) α v + 1 2 + 1 - 1 v j,f n α v 2 + s 2 j,f n q(s j,f n ) 2λ 2 j,f n ,<label>(27) where c</label></formula><p>= denotes equality up to an additive constant. From this equation we indeed recognize that the optimal distribution q (v j,f n ) is Inverse-Gamma as already indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.

(<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">)</formula><p>3) E-S Step: Straightforward differentiation of the VFE with respect to the variance γ j,f n leads to the following update: Let us now focus on the update of the mean parameters {ŝ j,f n } j,f,n . Let ŝ ∈ R JF N denote the column vector of entries ŝj,fn and ∆ŝ the gradient of the VFE with respect to ŝ. Let x i = [x i (0), ..., x i (T -1)] and Ĝi ∈ R T ×JF N be the matrix formed by concatenating the column vectors ĝij,fn . We can show that the gradient is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">γ j,f n = ν v β j,f n λ 2 j,f n + I i=1 1 σ 2 i La-1 τ =0 ρ ij (τ ) + ĝij,fn</formula><formula xml:id="formula_43">∆ŝ = Λ ŝŝ - I i=1 1 σ 2 i Ĝ i x i ,<label>(34)</label></formula><p>where for any arbitrary mapping<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> between the triplet (j, f, n) and b ∈ {1, ..., B} with B = J j=1 F j N j , the matrix Λ ŝ ∈ R JF N ×JF N is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">Λ ŝ = diag ν v β j,f n λ 2 j,f n + I i=1 1 σ 2 i La-1 τ =0 ρ ij (τ ) b + I i=1 1 σ 2 i Ĝ i Ĝi .<label>(35)</label></formula><p>diag({c(b)} b ) denotes the diagonal matrix constructed from the sequence of coefficients c(b). It is clear from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_44">35</ref>) that canceling the gradient with respect to ŝ is equivalent to solving a symmetric positive semidefinite linear system of equations. For that purpose we employ the PCG method <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. The preconditioning matrix is equal to the diagonal part of Λ ŝ. We can show that [Λ ŝ] b,b = γ -1 j,f n . It is interesting to note that each entry of the gradient will therefore be scaled by the variance γ j,f n . This scaling compensates for the fact that changing the mean of a Gaussian distribution with a small variance has a much stronger impact than when the variance is large. Moreover we can mention that γ -1 j,f n is equal to the Fisher information defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">I(ŝ j,f n ) = -∂ 2 (ln q (s j,f n )) /(∂ŝ 2 j,f n ) q (s j,f n )</formula><p>.</p><p>The Fisher information is indeed used for characterizing the geometry of an optimization problem related to probability distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and it is involved in the computation of the natural gradient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) E-A</head><p>Step: This step is very similar to the E-S step. Straightforward differentiation of the VFE with respect to the variance ρ ij (t) leads to the following update:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">ρ ij (t) =   ν u d ij (t)r 2 (t) + 1 σ 2 i   ŝj 2 2 + (f,n)∈Bj γ j,f n     -1 ,<label>(36)</label></formula><p>where ŝj = [ŝ j (0), ..., ŝj (L s -1)] .</p><p>Let us define âij = [â ij (0), ..., âij (L a -1)] and ∆â ij the gradient of the VFE with respect to âij .

It is straightforward to verify that [Λ âij ] t,t = ρ ij (t) -1 because rφφ j,f n (0) = 1, the MDCT atoms forming an orthonormal basis, and rss j (0) = ŝj 2 2 . We can finally mention that as the update of âij depends on {â ij } j =j , it is necessary to proceed sequentially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. M-Step</head><p>1) Noise Variance: In practice we will decrease the noise variance σ 2 i progressively along the iterations. This parameter allows us to balance the contributions of the priors and the likelihood in the VFE. A relatively high variance can be interpreted as favoring the priors, which can be useful in the first iterations. On the contrary, decreasing the variance progressively will increase the contribution of the observed data in the estimation of the parameters. Such an approach has already been shown to be useful in source separation (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Setup 1) Database:</head><p>The experiments are performed using musical audio source signals provided by the MTG MASS database <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. We created 8 stereo mixtures sampled at 16 kHz using RIRs from the MIRD database <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. These RIRs were measured in a room with adjustable reverberation level in order to obtain three different reverberation times: 160, 360 and 610 ms. Each mixture contains between 3 and 5 spatially disjoint sources and its duration ranges from 12 to 28 seconds. The musical instruments involved in this database are drums, piano, bass, guitar and voice.</p><p>2) Semi-blind Scenario: The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new Bayesian source separation framework where the mixing filters are treated as latent random variables in the time domain. This is why we are mostly interested in the evaluation of the mixing model. Therefore, we will assume some prior knowledge on the source signals. In order to keep a realistic scenario, we only learn for each source the NMF spectral templates (the matrix W j using a rank of K j = 10) from the true source signals. These "ideal pretrained dictionaries" are then fixed during the VEM algorithm, only the activation matrices H j are updated at the M-Step. We also assume that the reverberation time is known in order to fix the exponential decay profile r(t) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. All other parameters are blindly estimated. This semi-blind scenario is used for the proposed method and the baselines.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the NMF parameters are shared across the sources and a latent variable is introduced in the source model in order to indicate to which source each NMF basis belongs. As we are here working in a semi-blind setting, this clustering information is known in advance.</p><p>3) Performance Measures: We evaluate the quality of the separation in terms of reconstructed stereo source images. We use standard energy ratios defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and expressed in decibels (dB): the signal-to-distortion (SDR), artifact (SAR) and interference (SIR) ratios and the source image-to-spatial distortion ratio (ISR). These measures are computed using the BSS Eval toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. We also consider the Overall Perceptual Score (OPS) which is a perceptually motivated objective measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. It is expressed in percentage and computed using the PEASS toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Parameters Initialization</head><p>We present below how the parameters of the proposed and baseline methods are initialized.</p><p>1) Variational Parameters of the Proposed Method: Let us first focus on the proposed method. ν v and ν u are fixed according to ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">28</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">31</ref>) respectively. The other variational parameters are then initialized as follows: β j,f n = α v /2 and γ j,f n = ṽj,fn λ 2 j,f n where ṽj,fn is a realization from IG(ν v , β j,f n ). ŝj,fn is then initialized as a realization from</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">N (0, γ j,f n ). d ij (t) = α u /2 and ρ ij (t) = ũij (t)r 2 (t) where ũij (t) is a realization from IG(ν u , d ij (t)). âij (t) is then initialized as a realization from N (0, ρ ij (t)).</formula><p>It is important to mention that we did not "optimize" this initialization procedure. It is just a simple way of initializing the approximate posterior distributions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">22</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> similarly to the corresponding prior distributions in Section II.</p><p>2) Spatial Parameters of the Baselines: The initial spatial parameters of the baseline methods are set using the initialization of âij (t) (see previous paragraph) in order to provide the same "initial information". For our previous method <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> we exactly set the deterministic time-domain mixing filters to âij (t). For the two baseline methods using an SCM model (rank 1 or 2), we first compute âij,f , the discrete Fourier transform of âij (t) with a number of points that is equal to the length of the STFT window. We then initialize the SCM of the j-th source as a rank-1 matrix built from the outer-product of âj,f = [â 1j,f , ..., âIj,f ] ∈ C I with itself.</p><p>3) NMF Parameters: As already mentioned we work in a semi-blind scenario where the dictionary matrices W j are computed from the true source TF coefficients denoted by {s j,f n } f,n . Let us first focus on the proposed Student's t source model where sj,fn ∈ R. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> we can use a majorize-minimize approach to show that maximizing the likelihood with respect to the NMF parameters under a nonnegativity constraint is equivalent to minimizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> under the same constraint with</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">pj,fn = α v s-2 j,f n + [W j H j ] -1 f n α v + 1 -1 ,<label>(47)</label></formula><p>which is defined using the current value of the NMF parameters. For the baseline methods where the source model is Gaussian (defined in the STFT or MDCT domains), we have pj,fn = |s j,f n | 2 . This minimization problem can be solved with the MU rules <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and recalled in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">42</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_58">43</ref>). Finally, once the dictionary matrix W j is estimated, we discard the obtained activation matrix H j and re-initialize it with an all-one matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Model Hyperparameters and Algorithm Parameters</head><p>The specific choices for model hyperparameters and algorithm parameters are described in this subsection. The experiments in this subsection have been performed using the mixtures associated with a reverberation time of 360 ms only, in order not to overfit on all mixing conditions. 1) Noise Variance: As explained in Section III-D1, instead of using <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> we decrease the noise variance σ 2 i over the iterations from 10 -2 to 10 -6 by using the same schedule as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>2) Scale Parameter of the Exponential Decay: Due to the well known scaling indeterminacy between the mixing filters and the source signals, the scale parameter σ r in (12) can be arbitrarily fixed. We here choose σ r = 0.1 so that the overall energy of the mixing filters is not too high.</p><p>3) Student's t Shape Parameters: We now study the influence on the source separation results of the shape parameters for the source and mixing Student's t models. For that purpose we consider a grid of values: (α v , α u ) ∈ {0.1, 1, 10, 100, ∞} 2 (infinity actually corresponds to 4.5 × 10 15 ). We recall that when the shape parameter tends to infinity, the Student's t distribution is equivalent to the Gaussian one. We compute the SDR averaged over all the separated sources in the database for all the values in this grid. The results are represented in the left plot of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. It can be seen that the optimal values are (α v , α u ) = (100, 1). The fact that α v is quite high tells us that the Gaussian assumption for the source model seems to be a reasonable choice. On the contrary we observe that it is very important to choose a small value for α u , confirming that the Student's t is much more appropriate than the Gaussian for modeling RIRs.</p><p>4) Time-frequency Resolution: The MDCT window length was fixed to 64 ms for all sources in the experiment detailed in the previous paragraph. However the fact that we consider time-domain observations for inferring TF latent sources allows us to adapt the TF transform to each source in the mixture (see Section II-A). In particular we can adapt the MDCT window length according to the nature of the source. We investigate here a simple scenario: we consider a window length for the drums different from that of any other instrument. Once again we resort to a grid search which is presented in the right plot of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The shape parameters for the Student's t source and mixing models were set according to the optimal values obtained in the previous paragraph. As could be expected, a short window is suitable for the drums (32 ms) while a long one is more appropriate for the other instruments (128 ms). This specificity of the model could be further investigated using for example unions of TF dictionaries with different resolutions for each source such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. However this is left for future work as this paper mostly focuses on proposing a new mixing model for reverberant mixtures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comparison with the Baselines</head><p>We compare in this subsection the source separation performance obtained with the proposed method and the baselines introduced in Section IV-A for three different reverberation times: 160, 360 and 610 ms. The Student's t shape parameters for the proposed model are fixed according to the preliminary results detailed in Section IV-D3. In order to provide a fair comparison we will detail the results with the proposed method when the TF window length is the same as that of the baseline methods (64 ms for all sources) and when it is set according to the previous results: 32 ms for drums and 128 ms for other instruments. Those two approaches are denoted by "Proposed -w/o adapted TF window" and "Proposed -w/ adapted TF window" respectively in the presentation of the results.</p><p>The results are detailed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. As can be seen, according to all the performance measures, our method performs better than the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, whether it uses an SCM of rank 1 or 2. This baseline method is algorithmically speaking close to ours, as both methods are based on a (V)EM algorithm. From this perspective, those results show that modeling reverberant mixtures in the time-domain, with suitable priors for the mixing filters, can help improving the source separation results.</p><p>However, we see that the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> performs better than ours in terms of SIR, and also in terms of SDR and ISR for the mixtures with a reverberation time of 160 and 610 ms. According to the SIR, this baseline method results in a lower amount of interferences between the estimated sources. However, as indicated by the SAR, this approach introduces more artifacts than the proposed one. Moreover, according to the OPS which is an objective measure of the global source separation quality designed to be correlated with the human perception, our method always performs better. The reader is invited to listen to the audio examples available online <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that the method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> performs better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, even though the models are in essence equivalent (in the case of an SCM of rank 2). This may be due to the use of multiplicative updates derived from the auxiliary function method instead of the EM algorithm. Our previous approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> with unconstrained time-domain mixing filters obtains the worst results according to the SDR, while the OPS tends to show that on average it performs better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> but worse than <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. By listening to the separated sources, we believe that the results are indeed not satisfactory especially for high reverberation times, which agrees with the tendency of the SDR to decrease when the reverberation time increases. Even though the time-domain convolutive mixing process is exactly represented in this method, the mixing filters are only estimated from the data, without constraints. We believe that this lack of constraint precisely explains the poor results for long mixing filters. We noticed in particular that due to some inherent ambiguities in the modeling of the source images in (1), some parts of the source signals were sometimes contained in the estimated mixing filters. On the contrary, we do not have this issue with the proposed method, thanks to the prior on the mixing filters. This is also illustrated with online audio examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</p><p>We also notice that even though the model hyperparameters of the proposed method (Student's t shape parameters and MDCT window length) have been optimized using the mixtures with a reverberation of 360 ms, they generalize well to other mixing conditions.</p><p>To conclude this experimental evaluation, we detail in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> the computation time of one iteration of all the source separation algorithms compared in this work. Those results are obtained with a 3.70 GHz processor, for a stereo mixture of 12 s sampled at 16 kHz, involving 3 sources and recorded with a reverberation time of 360 ms. The methods based on a timedomain representation of the convolutive mixing process, as the one proposed in this paper, are the most computationally demanding.</p><p>For the sake of reproducibility, a Matlab implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper introduced a new Bayesian framework for multichannel audio source separation based on a time-domain representation of the convolutive mixing process. The experiments have revealed that the Gaussian distribution seems to be a reasonable choice for modeling the source signals in the MDCT domain. On the contrary, we have shown that using a heavy-tailed distribution is very important for modeling the impulse response of the mixing filters. Indeed, the robustness of the Student's t distribution allowed us to take into account the direct path and the early echoes of an RIR, which act as outliers with respect to the standard Gaussian model with exponentially decaying envelope. To conclude this paper, we present below some tracks for future research.</p><p>The model presented in Section II-D assumed that the RIR coefficients were i.i.d. However we could refine it by considering that the early and late parts of the RIR are not identically distributed. We have to mention that we investigated such an approach within the proposed framework. We used a time-dependent shape parameter α u (t), allowing us to assume a Gaussian distribution for late reverberation only, while a Student's t model with finite shape parameter was used for the early contributions. As this approach did not improve the source separation results we did not present it. We believe that even though considering a time-dependent shape parameter allows us to better fit the true statistics of the mixing filters, it does not necessarily imply that it will lead to better separation results. It is for example known in blind deconvolution of images that the optimal image prior is not the one that most closely fits the statistics of natural images. It is rather the one that discriminates the blurry and sharp images as much as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</p><p>It could also be interesting to study whether the proposed mixing model is sufficiently flexible to be robust to mismatched mixing conditions such as inaccurate reverberation time. We could also develop other temporal profiles for r(t) in order to represent different mixing scenarios, corresponding to the use of delays for example, which are popular audio effects in music.</p><p>In this work we considered a semi-blind scenario using oracle NMF dictionaries. Indeed our main objective was to present a new framework with a probabilistic model of mixing filters in the time domain. Nevertheless, we will focus on developing a "fully" blind method in future works. We carefully designed the experimental setup in order to be able to extend this framework in a supervised way. It could for example consist in pre-training NMF dictionaries using a database such as MedleyDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. One could also use more sophisticated NMF-based source models such as the ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (e.g. a source/filter model). In that case only the NMF update in the M-step of the proposed algorithm should be modified. Another important perspective lies in the use of neural networks for modeling the scale parameters λ j,f n in the source model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Such an approach was followed for the Gaussian SCM model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, although this method was designed for underdetermined audio source separation, it is not limited to this setting and it can also be used in the (over-)determined case. In particular, it would be interesting to compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art determined source separation method recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which unifies independent vector analysis and NMF in a new framework called independent low-rank matrix analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A THE STUDENT'S t DISTRIBUTION</head><p>The probability density function (pdf) of the Student's t distribution over a real-valued r.v. is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">T α (x; µ, λ) = 1 √ απλ 2 Γ α+1 2 Γ α 2 1 + 1 α (x -µ) 2 λ 2 -α+1 2 ,<label>(48)</label></formula><p>where Γ(•) denotes the Gamma function. It can be shown (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>) that the Student's t distribution results from compounding a Gaussian distribution N (µ, vλ 2 ) with an inversegamma distribution IG (α/2, α/2) over v:</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">T α (x; µ, λ) = +∞ 0 N x; µ, vλ 2 IG v; α 2 , α 2 dv.

Therefore, in this limit the Student's t distribution reduces to the Gaussian one. The two following properties of the inverse-gamma distribution are used in the derivation of the proposed source separation algorithm: E[x -1 ] = α/β and E[ln(x)] = ln(β) -ψ(α) where ψ(•) is the digamma function.</p></div>
