<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The recent advancements in wireless networking and computing systems pave the way for novel mission-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) use-cases that rely on Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). Representative use cases include teleoperation and telerobotics, both characterized by an uplinkintensive communication from a multi-sensory IoT device, comprising audio, video and haptic data traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This traffic is often mission-critical, such that the key requirements include low latency and high reliability. However, a wearable IoT device that streams the multi-sensory data in the uplink is resource-constrained, not least with respect to the available computational power. Furthermore, reliability and latency are challenged by the variable and error-prone wireless link.</p><p>In this paper, we examine a scenario in which a device located in the remote environment interacts with the Base Station (BS), equipped with a MEC server. We focus on the segment of the uplink connection between the device and the BS, and analyse the uplink latency that comprises the time elapsed in data compression followed by the transmission. The key contributions of this work are:</p><p>1) We derive a tractable model of the uplink latency as a random variable (RV), relating the lossless-compression ratio and link-outage probability. Specifically, we obtain the probability distribution of the latency. 2) We consider two different transmission strategies:</p><p>(1) Outage-constrained transmission, and (2) Latencyconstrained transmission and formulate the respective optimization problems. These problems are shown to be non-convex, and are transformed into convex ones. This allows to find the optimal latency and optimal outage, respectively.</p><p>3) The obtained results are compared with the ones of the analogous optimization problem that are tailored to the expected values for latency, as done in the prior works.</p><p>The results show that the proposed approach is superior in terms of reliability and latency. 4) Interestingly, the results reveal that the data compression is not always beneficial and its utility depends on the computational capability of the device and the reliability requirements.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. This section is concluded by a brief overview of the related work. Section II introduces the system model. Section III models the uplink latency and derives its probability distribution function (PDF). The optimization problems relevant for the system design are discussed in Section IV. The evaluation is presented in Section V, followed by concluding remarks in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Work</head><p>Time delay significantly affects the performance of teleoperation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The use of fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks have been envisioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to reduce latency in teleoperation applications, where the wireless front ends, such as base stations and WiFi access points, are integrated with optical network units. These works consider the average end-to-end delay while analysing the latency-constrained teleoperation scenario. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, 5G network architecture based on the network function virtualization (NFV) technology is presented to support the implementation of Tactile Internet (TI) applications. Using NFV-based TI architecture, a utility function-based model is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to evaluate the performance of the NFV-based TI by considering the resolution of the human perception and the network cost of completing services. The utility function depends on the average round-trip delay, network link bandwidth, and node virtual resource consumption. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) was used in a TI application <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, where the tasks are offloaded to a MEC server for processing. An MEC-based TI system was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to satisfy the quality-of-experience. A hybrid edgecaching scheme for heterogeneous TI network is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, where the average end-to-end latency, comprising transmission times between users to edge nodes and edge nodes to central cloud servers, is optimized. A real time architecture for telesurgery application is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, where realtime telesurgery is envisioned by employing cloud and MEC networks using software-defined networking as infrastructure to satisfy the average end-to-end latency.</p><p>The works reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> treat the latency through its expected value, which poses limitations on the applicability of these approaches. Specifically, as shown in the present paper, the latency is a RV, which also impacts the communication reliability. Consequentially, system design that relies upon the optimization of the expected latency does not ensure highreliability, as it leads to underprovisioning. Furthermore, the reliability of data transmission with tolerable packet loss has also not been considered. We also note that, to the best of our knowledge, in these works the data-compression latency has neither been explored nor modelled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>The system model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It consists of a multisensory IoT device, such as a robot, located in a remote environment and a BS equipped with MEC server, communicating over a wireless channel. The BS collects the data from the device and process it on the MEC server. The volume of the data may be significant, potentially requiring compression before the data is transmitted. Thus, the total latency budget in the uplink consists of parts pertaining to both data compression and transmission. The latency of data compression depends upon the compression ratio and the processing capability of the device. Regarding the data transmission, the randomness in wireless channel restricts the data rate that can be transmitted reliably. In the next section, we perform analysis of the total uplink latency, which is the critical contributor to the total latency in the system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. LATENCY-OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>In this section, we consider an optimization framework in which we assess reliability, defined as the probability that the data is received correctly within certain deadline. Based on the results in Section III and on this reliability criterion, two optimization problems are formulated to investigate the tradeoff between outage and compression ratio, as discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Outage-Constrained Uplink</head><p>In some application scenarios, there is a maximum outage level, say ǫ th , that can be tolerated for data transmission, with the known SNR statistics as well as device's computational capability at the receiver. Here, the total uplink latency elapsed is minimized by maintaining the tolerated outage level. The optimization problem in such scenarios is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P1 : min Ntx,Q t s.t. C1 : F T (t) ≥ ρ th ; C2 : 0 ≤ ǫ ≤ ǫ th ; C3 : Q ≥ 1</formula><p>Constraint C1 expresses the stochastic nature of the latency, where ρ th is the probability that the latency should be at most τ . Constraint C2 restricts the outage level not to exceed ǫ th , whereas C3 indicates the range of compression ratio.</p><p>P1 is not a convex optimization problem, since C1 is not a convex function (see Theorem 1). Now, the inverse of C1, which is the CDF of the Gamma distribution, is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">τ (t) = F -1 T (ρ th , κ) = τ 0 .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">19</ref>) and (20), the latency t is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">t = τ 0 D f κf R C(Q) + D f T 0 1 QR(ǫ) = W (Q, ǫ).<label>(21)</label></formula><p>Using (21), the optimization problem P1 can be reinterpreted as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">P1a : min Q,ǫ W (Q, ǫ), s.t. C2 and C3 Theorem 2. W (Q, ǫ) is a convex function of Q and ǫ. Proof. See Appendix B.</formula><p>Thus, the optimization problem P1a is a convex optimization problem that can be solved by CVX <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and the obtained solution is a global optimum. The optimal values of ǫ and Q can be used to estimate the optimal number of channel use required to transmit the compressed data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Latency-Constrained Uplink</head><p>In another type of scenarios of a fixed latency budget, say T th , is allotted. The optimization problem for this case is to minimize the outage, formulated as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">P2 : min Ntx,Q ǫ, s.t. C3; C4 : F T (t = T th ) ≥ ρ th ; C5 : ǫ ≥ 0</formula><p>Constraint C3 has been already introduced and indicates the range of compression ratio. C4 ensures the reliability of transmission in stochastic sense within the latency budget T th .</p><p>C5 restricts the outage level to be greater than 0.</p><p>Again, P2 is not a convex optimization problem, since C4 is not a convex function (Theorem 1). Using the inverse of the CDF of the Gamma distribution, C4 can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">1 R(ǫ) = Q D f T 0 T th - τ 0 D f κf R C(Q) = U (Q) (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>where τ 0 = τ (T th ).</p><p>Minimizing ǫ is equivalent to maximizing 1 R(ǫ) since R(ǫ) is an increasing function of ǫ (see Remark 1). Thus, using (22), the optimization problem P2 becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">P2a : max Q U (Q), s.t. C3 and C4 Theorem 3. U (Q) is a concave function of Q. Proof. See Appendix C.</formula><p>The problem P2a is concave, and its solution will provide the global optimum. The optimal value of outage ǫ opt can be found using the optimal value of Q from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">22</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>We illustrate the analysis presented in the previous sections through numerical evaluations. The values of the parameters are: K 0 = -27 dB, d = 2 km, B = 10 MHz, N 0 = -110 dBm, T 0 = 0.5 µs, P tx = 0.5 W, κ = 1.5, Ψ = 3.5, D f = 1 Mb, and f R = {1, 5, 10} GHz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimal System Design</head><p>For outage-constrained system design, the optimal system parameters as functions of the outage probability threshold ǫ th are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, for different clock speed of the device's processor, i.e., f R . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a) reveals that the optimal latency decreases with increase in outage threshold ǫ th . Likewise, the optimal compression ratio also decreases with the increase in outage threshold, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2(b</ref>). Specifically, a lower tolerated outage demands for a lesser rate and, thus, a higher compression ratio. When the the tolerated outage is increased, the rate can be increased and, thus, the compression ratio can be decreased. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2(b</ref>) also reveals that transmission without  compression (i.e., Q = 1) becomes the optimal strategy as ǫ th increases; the value of ǫ th when this happens depends on the f R . This is due to the fact that for higher ǫ th it becomes more opportune to spend the time on transmission with higher rate than to spend it on compression. The same fact is also illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2(c)</ref>, showing the fraction of uplink latency used in compressing the data as function of outage threshold. It can be concluded that compression of raw data is not always beneficial, but depends on the capabilities of the processor as well as on the tolerated outage level.  For latency-aware system design, the optimal system parameters as functions of latency threshold T th are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, for varying f R . The optimal value of the outage decreases with the increase in T th , whereas the optimal compression ratio increases. In other words, when the latency budget is high, more time can be invested in compression, which will lower the rate and allow for a transmission with a lower outage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison with Optimization in Expected Sense</head><p>The works reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> analyze the latency in teleoperation systems in terms of its average value (i.e., in expected sense), in contrast to the approach taken in this paper. For the sake of comparison, here we reformulate P2 to assume expected value of the uplink latency, and examine the obtained results. For a given latency budget T th , using (18)) we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">1 R(ǫ) = Q T 0 T th D f - C(Q) f R = V (Q)<label>(23)</label></formula><p>Thus, the optimization problem for latency-constrained uplink is formulated as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">A : max Q V (Q), s.t. C3 and C4</formula><p>V (Q) is the concave function of Q; the proof is omitted due to space constraint. Thus, A is a convex optimization problem  that can be solved using CVX. The optimal system parameters as functions of the latency threshold T th are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> for (i) different values of ρ th for optimization problem P2a and (ii) for problem A. It may be noted that, when T th is fixed, the optimal outage in case of optimization in expected sense is lower than that with ρ th ≥ 0.95, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4(a)</ref>. This implies that in this case, the device will transmit with a lower rate and a higher compression ratio, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4(b)</ref>.</p><p>In other words, this approach may lead to over-provisioning. Conversely, the required latency budget to achieve certain level of outage will be shorter for the system design in expected sense, than for the one treating latency as a RV. For instance, to achieve an outage of 2 × 10 -4 , the former approach should dimension the latency budget to be 347 ms, whereas the latency budget of 392 ms, 418 ms, and 432 ms is required in the latter approach to achieve the reliability of 0.95, 0.99, and 0.999, respectively. In effect, this represents a case of underprovisioning and of a potential performance degradation. We also note that that the system design treating outage in the expected sense (i.e., an optimization analogous to the one in P1a) will show similar shortcomings; the presentation of the corresponding results is omitted due to space constraints.</p><p>VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS This work has been motivated by the general question about the optimal compression/transmission strategy in systems constrained by latency and reliability. We have introduced a framework to analyse the uplink latency of data transfer from the device to the Base Station that has a Mobile Edge Computing server. The data is compressed before transmission. We have analyzed the latency as a random variable and investigated different trade-offs and achievable performance between latency, link outage, and transmission reliability. We have also shown the shortcomings of the design approaches that treat latency via its expected value. Our future work includes the latency analysis of the closed-loop control systems, for which the analysis presented in this paper constitutes a building block.
