<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Conclusions: Language difficulties are associated with peer-victimization and bullyperpetration. The risk of peer-victimization and bully-perpetration differs according to different developmental paths of language difficulties from preschool to school age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Language is closely related to children's social development, and influence communication with peers, peer-relationships and engagement in play situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Irwin et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Longobardi et al., 2016)</ref>. Language is a tool for explaining and understanding one's own feelings, experience and behavior, and becomes increasingly important for emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Vallotton &amp; Ayoub, 2011)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Forrest et al. (2020)</ref> found that poor emotional regulation predicted later peer problems and emotional difficulties, and that these associations were stronger among children at risk with language disorders. Moreover, children with poor language skills had reduced trajectories of health-related quality of life compared to typically developing children when measured from four to 13 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Le et al., 2020)</ref>. Children who do not attain adequate language skills may therefore show more social problems, emotional difficulties and behavioral difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Norbury et al., 2016)</ref>. Accordingly, children with language difficulties could be less included in social interactions and experience more peer-related conflicts. Thus, making them more prone to peer-victimization, and more involved in bully-perpetration.</p><p>Several studies have found that children with language difficulties, including both children with language disorders (e.g. developmental language disorders, specific language impairment [SLI]) and children with poor language skills, experience more bullying and peer-victimization compared to their typically developing (TD) peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Durkin &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Knox &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McCormack et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Redmond, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">van den Bedem et al., 2018)</ref>. However, few studies have investigated if these children also bully others (bully-perpetration) more than TD children. Also, few studies have investigated these associations in preschool children.</p><p>Previous findings suggest that aggression is associated with language difficulties from an early age <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. Increasing levels of aggressive behavior toward peers could develop into bully-perpetration behavior among young children with language difficulties. In addition, early experiences of peer-victimization may lead to bullyperpetration <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lereya et al., 2015)</ref>. Despite our understanding and awareness about social integration problems and peer-problems for children with language disorders, there is still a lack of knowledge about peer-victimization and bully-perpetration among these children <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Durkin &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Knox &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2003)</ref>. This is important as peer-victimization is found to moderate internalizing difficulties for children with a history of language disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kilpatrick et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Peer-victimization could therefore have adverse effects on a range of developmental outcomes beyond pre-existing problems such as language difficulties <ref type="bibr">(Wolke &amp; Lereya, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Only a limited number of studies have investigated if children with language difficulties are more involved in bully-perpetration compared to their TD peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Forrest et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rennecke et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">van den Bedem et al., 2018)</ref>, and few have included preschool children <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Forrest et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rennecke et al., 2020)</ref>. Interestingly, only <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rennecke et al. (2020)</ref> found an association between language difficulties and bully-perpetration. These conflicting findings could be because bullying behavior is more frequent among younger children <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ladd et al., 2017)</ref>. It is also possible that different measures of language and different inclusion criteria for having language difficulties could explain these divergent findings. Bully-perpetration is linked to individual and peer-related difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pepler et al., 2008)</ref>, which in turn could influence the development of co-occurring difficulties for children with language difficulties. More research is therefore needed to establish circumstances under which the association between language difficulties and bully-perpetration may occur.</p><p>Although children with poor language skills are found to have behavior difficulties and social struggles from an early age <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Longobardi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018)</ref>, few studies have investigated if these children also experience more peervictimization before entering school. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McCormack et al. (2011)</ref> found that communication impairment measured at four to five years was associated with peervictimization in school age. Consistent with this, young children with language difficulties and language disorders experienced more peer-victimization at five years compared to their TD peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rennecke et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Øksendal et al., 2019)</ref>. While the former study measured language disorders and peer-victimization at different time points, these measures were relatively close to each other. Research investigating the longitudinal associations between language and peer-victimization is therefore still called for <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rennecke et al., 2020)</ref>. This is important because different patterns of stability from persistent to full recovery of language difficulties until school age have been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Henrichs et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zambrana et al., 2014)</ref>, and different patterns of language development may be differently linked to social difficulties and peer related problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(McKean et al., 2017)</ref>. Effects of language difficulties on subsequent peervictimization may therefore differ depending on whether the language difficulties are transient or persistent into school age. Moreover, earlier studies have found different trajectories of peer-problems among children with language disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conti-Ramsden et al., 2019)</ref>, and that the stability of peer-victimization may vary among young children <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Wardrop, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wolke, Woods, et al., 2009)</ref>. Still, it is unknown whether children with language difficulties are more vulnerable to stable trajectories of peer-victimization.</p><p>Language is multidimensional, and includes dimensions such as semantics, syntax, pragmatics and phonology. Language seems to be unidimensional when children are young but progressively develops into more distinct dimensions as children grow older <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tomblin &amp; Zhang, 2006)</ref>. This raises the question of whether the association between language and social problems is dependent on developmental age or type of language difficulty. When investigating how different aspects of language were linked to peer-rejection, van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wilt et al. (2020)</ref> found that children's vocabulary knowledge (receptive skills) was indirectly associated with peer-rejection through oral communicative competence (expressive skills). Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rennecke et al. (2019)</ref> found that both receptive and expressive language disorders were associated with peer-victimization and bully-perpetration.</p><p>Other studies have found that different dimensions of language are differently linked to behavioral difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(van Daal et al., 2007)</ref>. For instance, children with low pragmatic language skills were found to be particularly prone to develop emotional difficulties and peer-problems compared to children with low receptive language skills and low expressive language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conti-Ramsden et al., 2019)</ref>. In another study, van <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Daal et al. (2007)</ref> found that dimensions of language such as semantic, syntax, speech and phonology correlated negatively with social problems, but only phonology and semantics were associated with internalizing difficulties. Altogether, these findings indicate that various aspects of language may be associated with different aspects of social problems, behavior problems, peer-rejection and peer-victimization.</p><p>When investigating how different dimensions of language were related to language difficulties, a Norwegian study found that most children with language difficulties had poor semantic language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ottem, 2009)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McCabe and Meller (2004)</ref> found that sematic language skills was an important indicator of language difficulties among preschool children. Interestingly, although poor semantic langue skills had the highest correlation to peer-problems and being withdrawn, a significant correlation with aggressive behavior was not found <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(van Daal et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers argue that social problems without overt aggressive behavior may go undetected by parents, teachers and caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Conti-Ramsden &amp; Botting, 2004)</ref>. It is therefore possible that children with poor semantic language skills are involved in negative peer interactions such as peer-victimization and bully-perpetration, without receiving adequate help.</p><p>The diversity of findings may also be explained by sample differences. Earlier studies that investigated language difficulties and peer-victimization have mostly used clinical samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Conti-Ramsden &amp; Botting, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Durkin &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Knox &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Redmond, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">van den Bedem et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Although clinical samples may give an accurate measure of language difficulties, clinical samples could be biased towards the most severe cases of language difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rutter &amp; Mawhood, 1991)</ref>. Children with more severe and stable language difficulties may receive more academic and social support or experience more stigmatizing behavior compared to children with mild language difficulties. With a longitudinal population-based sample, which also includes children with a wider continuum of language skills and difficulties, it is possible to investigate children with different severity and different developmental paths of language difficulties and how these might be associated with peer-victimization and bully-perpetration across time.</p><p>Previous findings indicate that boys' language develop later than girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brandlistuen et al., 2020)</ref>. Boys are also over-represented among children with language difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hollund-Møllerhaug, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zubrick et al., 2007)</ref> and among children involved in bullying behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wolke et al., 2001)</ref>. In addition, earlier studies indicate that boys and girls with language difficulties show different development of co-occurring difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helland et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stowe et al., 1999)</ref>. This could influence the association to peer-victimization and bully-perpetration for boys and girls with language difficulties. Researchers that investigated language difficulties, peervictimization and bully-perpetration mostly presented their results adjusted for gender effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Forrest et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McCormack et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Øksendal et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, little is known about gender difference in the paths between language difficulties, peervictimization and bully-perpetration.</p><p>Bullying is defined by repeated aggression (2-3 times a month) where the behavior is intended to harm, and there is a real or perceived imbalance of power between the victim and the perpetrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Solberg &amp; Olweus, 2003)</ref>. Peer-victimization is a form of peer abuse in which a child is regularly the target of aggression, but does not necessarily include all aspects of the bullying definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kochenderfer &amp; Ladd, 1996)</ref>. Bully-perpetration is the act of victimizing others. Owing to cognitive and social immaturity, imbalance of power and intention to harm may be difficult to measure among young children <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Vlachou et al., 2011)</ref>. The terms "peer-victimization" and "bully-perpetration" are therefore defined more loosely in our study compared to the term "bullying".</p><p>In the current study we have used a large population-based sample to investigate the associations between language difficulties, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration. We used two approaches, where first, we investigate these associations with latent continuous measures of children's language skills, and second, by comparing children with language difficulties to TD children. The aim of the current study was to investigate stability and change between language skills measured at three, five and eight years, peer-victimization measured at five and eight years and bully-perpetration measured at eight years. We also aimed to investigate the risk of peer-victimization/bully-perpetration for children with predefined developmental paths of language difficulties compared to children without language difficulties. More specifically, the following hypotheses were investigated: 1) Children with language difficulties are more involved in bullying behavior compared to children without language difficulties 2) These associations will be stronger for boys and for children with stable paths of language difficulties 3) There will be cumulative associations between poor language skills and bullying behavior shown across children's development </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>Children's language skills at three, five and eight years were assessed with selected items for MoBa from validated measurement scales (shown in supplementary Appendix A). These items were indicators of our latent variables and used to create the categorical variables. Language at three years was measured with five items from the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). The parental ASQ is a widely used screening instrument for assessing children's development <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Squires et al., 1997)</ref>. The 36-months questionnaire has shown good discriminative power for identifying school-related difficulties among children born premature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Halbwachs et al., 2014)</ref>. In MoBa, measures of communication and motor skills are included. ASQ has been used in previous studies investigating young children with language difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zambrana et al., 2014)</ref>. The validity of ASQ has been demonstrated in a Norwegian context <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Richter &amp; Janson, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gadermann et al. (2012)</ref> argue that when a scale is measured with categorical indicators, and has a skewed distribution across response categories, Cronbach's alpha may underestimate the reliability of the scale.</p><p>Ordinal alphas were therefore calculated based on the polychoric correlation matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gadermann et al., 2012)</ref>. Polychoric reliability for ASQ was .91 in this study.</p><p>Language at five and eight years were measured with eight items assessing semantic language skills from the 20-item checklist (Language 20Q) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ottem, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Semantic language skills represent the ability to comprehend the meaning of words, which may include both understanding and communicating language <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ottem, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The Language 20Q is used as a screening instrument for detecting language difficulties among Norwegian children, and the predictive validity of Language 20Q has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ottem, 2009)</ref>. Because poor semantic language skills are clear indicators of language difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McCabe &amp; Meller, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ottem, 2009)</ref>, and are associated with social problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(van Daal et al., 2007)</ref>, semantic language skills were used to measure poor language skills and language difficulties at five and eight years.</p><p>Polychoric reliability for Language 20Q was .93 at five and eight years in this study.</p><p>Language skills were estimated as latent, continuous variables with categorical indicators, and were included in our autoregressive cross-lagged model. Latent variables are adjusted for bias owing to random error and construct irrelevant variance and could therefore make our measurements more robust <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tomarken &amp; Waller, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The distribution of responses to the categorical indicators was skewed, suggesting that most children had few or no symptoms of language difficulties. Variation was thus concentrated in the higher end of the language scales because high scores indicated difficulties. Developmental paths of language difficulties were measured with categorical variables and were included in our logistic regression analyses.</p><p>Previous studies have found that approximately seven to 10% of children were identified as having language difficulties (Hollund-Møllerhaug, 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Norbury et al., 2016)</ref>. Accordingly, earlier studies assessing language difficulties utilizing MoBa-data have set a predefined cutoff of 1.5 standard deviation below the mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zambrana et al., 2014)</ref> corresponding to approximately 10%. In the current study, groups within the highest ~90 th percentile (indicating difficulties) were created to investigate different developmental paths of language difficulties. We created mean scores to measure language difficulties. Cutoff was set at a mean value of 1.40 at 3 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">years (1-3), 2.14 at 5 years (1-5)</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2.13 at 8 years (1-5</ref> When creating groups of children with mild language difficulties, a slightly wider estimate of ~80 th percentile (indicating mild difficulties) was used. Demographic and developmental details for these groups are shown in tables 1 and 2.</p><p>-Insert Table <ref type="table">1</ref> here--Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> here-Peer-victimization at five years was measured by mother's rating of the statement, "My child is teased/bullied by other children", during the past two months.</p><p>Response categories were "never", "sometimes" or "often". Peer-victimization at eight years was measured by mother's rating of the question "In the past 12 months has your child been teased or bullied by other children?". Response categories were "never", "seldom", "two or three times a month", "once a week" or "many times a week".</p><p>Bully-perpetration was only available at eight years and was measured by mother's rating of the question: "In the past 12 months has your child participated in teasing or bullying other children?". Response categories were "never", "seldom", "two or three times a month", "once a week" or "many times a week". The measures of peervictimization and bully-perpetration at eight years corresponded to the measures used for Norwegian school children, where peer-victimization and bully-perpetration is assessed annually for fifth grade students and older <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wendelborg, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In logistic regression analysis, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration were dichotomized. At five years, "sometimes" and "often" corresponded to peer-victimization. At eight years, "two or three times a month", "once a week" and "many times a week" corresponded to peer-victimization and bully-perpetration. In the autoregressive cross-lagged model, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration were included as observed variables using the whole range of the response indicators.</p><p>Premature children are at increased risk of peer-victimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Liu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wolke, Baumann, et al., 2015)</ref> and poor language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Putnick et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stene-Larsen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wolke, Samara, et al., 2008)</ref>. Results were therefore adjusted for gestational age at birth&lt;37 weeks. Information about gestational age and the child's gender was retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, which is a national health registry containing information about all births in Norway <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Irgens, 2000)</ref>. The full range of available measures included in all MoBa-questionnaires is described in detail at the following website: (<ref type="url" target="https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/for-forskereartikler/questionnaires-from-moba/">https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/for-forskereartikler/questionnaires-from-moba/</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to conduct measurement models for how well the categorical indicators reflect the latent variables. CFA is hypothesis driven, which means that all aspects of the CFA model are pre-specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. After developing measurement models, the unadjusted bivariate correlations between all variables included in our autoregressive cross-lagged model were investigated (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Last, an autoregressive cross-lagged panel model was used to investigate the relationships between language skills, peer-victimization and bullyperpetration. Only significant paths were included in our final model. Comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), were used as fit indices for the measurement models and the structural equation model (SEM). Although RMSEA, TLI and CFI are found to be less prominent in discovering model-data misfit when ordered categorical data are used, alternative model fit parameters have not yet been agreed upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Xia &amp; Yang, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The stability of language skills was accounted for by estimating the autoregression between each point of measurement. To control for the time invariant associations between measurements in our model, the correlation between language skills at three and eight years was estimated, and comparable items at five and eight years were allowed to co-vary. Although the unadjusted correlation between language skills measured at three years and bully-perpetration at eight years was positive, this association was negative in the full model, and was therefore set to zero.</p><p>First, all direct paths between variables were investigated, and then the indirect paths between language skills at three years and peer-victimization/bully-perpetration at eight years were investigated. Nested models grouped by gender were also investigated. As a default the measurement models for boys and girls were set be equal, and the paths between boys and girls were compared. To account for confounding due to premature gestational age and age difference between children at the time of filling out the questionnaires, results were adjusted for the child's age at three, five and eight years, and gestational age at birth&lt;37 weeks. Analyses were performed in Mplus version 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017)</ref>. As mentioned earlier, our variables were highly skewed. The weighted least squares mean and variance (WLSMV) is a robust estimator that accounts for skewed variables, and offers the best alternative for modeling categorical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. WLSMV was used in this study.</p><p>Groups representing different developmental paths of language difficulties were created. The persistent language difficulties group included children that had difficulties at all measurement points. The transient language difficulties group included children that had difficulties at three and five years, but not eight years. The late onset language difficulties group included children that only had difficulties at eight years. These groups were included in logistic regression analysis where the risk of peer-victimization and bully-perpetration for children with different paths of language difficulties as opposed to having no language difficulties at three, five and eight years were investigated. Last, a mild language difficulty group was created.</p><p>Children that were not included in any of the previous language difficulties groups, but still had measures corresponding to ~80 th percentile (indicating mild difficulties) at three, five and eight years were included. In a separate analysis, the risk of peervictimization and bully-perpetration for children with mild language difficulties as opposed to having no language difficulties were estimated. Results show crude odds ratio (OR) and OR adjusted for gender and gestational age at birth&lt;37 weeks. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (IBM, Armonk, New York).</p></div>

The autoregressive paths show the stability of language skills and peer-victimization, and the cross-lagged paths are adjusted for the stability from earlier measurements for each variable. This means that poor language skills at five years predicted peer-victimization at eight years, adjusted for peer-victimization at five years, indicating an association between poor language skills at five years and change of peer-victimization from five to eight years.</p><p>Poor language skills at five years was associated with bully-perpetration at eight years (β=.086; 95% confidence intervals <ref type="bibr">[CI]</ref> .064-.109 p&lt;.001), and poor language skills and bully-perpetration correlated at eight years (r=.053; 95% CI .030-.077 p&lt;.001).

Last, peer-victimization at five years was associated with increased symptoms of poor language skills at eight years (β=.068; 95% CI .040-.096 p&lt;.001).

These results indicate that the stability of poor language skills from three to five years increase peer-victimization/bully-perpetration at eight years, and that peer-victimization at five years could mediate the association between poor language skills at three years and peer-victimization/bully-perpetration at eight years.</p><p>Finally, gender difference in our model was investigated.

When each path was constrained, and the models for boys and girls were compared using the Wald chi-square test, the association between peer-victimization at five years and bully-perpetration at eight years was stronger for boys and the correlation between peer-victimization and bully-perpetration at eight years was stronger for girls.</p><p>The chi-square test (χ2=4728.362), for the structural model was significant (p&lt;.001; DF=317).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Peer-victimization and bully-perpetration for different paths of language difficulties and mild language difficulties</head><p>A total of 22 048 children with complete measures of language skills at three, five and eight years of age were included in logistic regression analysis. Of these children, 20 549 did not have language difficulties at any of the measurement points and comprised the reference group. The persistent language difficulties group (language difficulties at three, five and eight years) consisted of 461 children (2.1%), the transient language difficulties group (language difficulties at only three and five years) consisted of 347 children (1.6%), and the late onset group (language difficulties at only eight years) consisted of 691 children (3.1%). In addition, 650 children with mild language difficulties at three, five and eight years were included in a separate group. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows the crude and adjusted OR of peer-victimization at five and eight years and bully-perpetration at eight years for children with different developmental paths of language difficulties and mild language difficulties as opposed to having no language difficulties. It is well known that language difficulties and symptoms of ADHD influence each other from an early age <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ribeiro et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wang et al., 2018)</ref>.

Although these adjustments had some influence on the magnitude of our results, the CIs of these results overlapped with the CIs for the adjusted ORs shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Thus, indicating that our findings could not be explained by co-occurring attention difficulties/hyperactivity.</p><p>-Insert Table <ref type="table">4</ref> here-The highest risk of peer-victimization at five and eight years, and bullyperpetration at eight years was found among children with persistent language difficulties. Children with transient, late onset and mild language difficulties also had an increased risk of peer-victimization at five and eight years, and children with late onset and mild language difficulties had an increased risk of bully-perpetration at eight years. This indicates that children with mild and fleeting paths of language difficulties are more prone to peer-victimization and bully-perpetration as opposed to those having no language difficulties. In addition, our results show that the risk of peervictimization for children with transient language difficulties is higher at five years than peer-victimization/bully-perpetration at eight years. This indicates that the risk of being involved in bullying behavior decreases with decreasing symptoms of language difficulties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate associations between language difficulties, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration from three through eight years of age. First, our results show that poor language skills at five years influence bullyperpetration and peer-victimization at eight years. Although these estimates were small due to conventional standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cohen, 1992)</ref>, it is important to consider that they were adjusted for earlier measures of language peer-victimization. Also, our results show a modest association between poor language skills and peer-victimization at five years, after adjusting for earlier measures of language skills, and a modest association between poor language skills at three years and peer-victimization at five years.</p><p>Second, our results show that the path from poor language skills at five years to bully-perpetration at eight years is stronger for girls. Third, our results show that children with persistent and stable language difficulties have the highest risk of peervictimization and bully-perpetration and the effect size is moderate. Last, our results</p><p>show that children with transient, late onset and mild language difficulties also have an increased risk of bully-prepetition and peer-victimization compared to children without language difficulties. Our results resemble current findings indicating that children with language disorders are involved in bully-perpetration from an early age <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rennecke et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rodkin et al. (2015)</ref> suggest that children bully peers to gain power by creating weakness in the child being exposed to bullying. Children with language difficulties may therefore participate in bully-perpetration to obtain a more favorable position in the peer group. Interestingly, van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Bedem et al. (2018)</ref> did not find that children with language disorders bullied their peers more than TD children. Moreover, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Forrest et al. (2018)</ref> found that children with language disorders at five years experienced more peer-problems at seven years when rated by their teachers, these children did not experience more peer-victimization, nor did they bully their peers more than children in the general population. Thus, showing some contrasting findings compared to our results. This could be because these associations were investigated among children (eight 16 years of age) in the first study <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(van den Bedem et al., 2018)</ref>, and with more emphasis on expressive language impairment in the latter study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Forrest et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Bullying behavior generally decreases as children grow older <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ladd et al., 2017)</ref>, which could indicate that higher estimates of bully-perpetration may be found among younger children. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">van Daal et al. (2007)</ref> found that different dimensions of language were differently linked to behavior problems. Poor semantic language skills showed among the highest correlation with social difficulties and being withdrawn <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(van Daal et al., 2007)</ref>. Another study found that lower vocabulary range was associated with less self-regulation skills among toddlers <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Vallotton &amp; Ayoub, 2011)</ref>. In addition, poor self-control and being disliked have been linked with bullyperpetration among school children <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bacchini et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Unnever &amp; Cornell, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Poor semantic language skills could therefore show different associations to bullyperpetration compared to other dimensions of language.</p><p>An interesting finding was that the association from poor language skills at five years to bully-perpetration at eight years was stronger for girls. Former research suggest that girls' language skills mature earlier than boys <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brandlistuen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Henrichs et al., 2011)</ref>. It is therefore possible that early play and social interaction among young girls include more advanced language compared to boys. Girls with poor language skills may therefore have a lower status in the peer group and participate in bully-perpetration to receive a higher status. This could be different for young boys, where motor skills and athletic competence play a different role in enhancing status and popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chase &amp; Dummer, 1992)</ref>. Research has found that girls with language difficulties are especially vulnerable to develop co-occurring internalizing difficulties as they transition to school <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helland et al., 2018)</ref>. Although boys are over-represented among children with language difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hollund-Møllerhaug, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zubrick et al., 2007)</ref>, girls may be viewed as more deviant compared to a social gender norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helland et al., 2018)</ref>. Girls with poor language skills could therefore be susceptible to develop adverse strategies when approaching peers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stowe et al. (1999)</ref> found that even though disruptive behavior was more common among boys with language difficulties, disruptive behavior also increased the likelihood of referral to support services. The researchers argue that boys with language difficulties may be more likely to receive professional help and support compared to girls. Conversely, girls' difficulties may go undetected by adults, thus increasing environmental stress and negative interaction with peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Stowe et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Another important finding was that children with poor language skills at three and five years were more exposed to peer-victimization at five years, and that children with poor language skills at five and eight years also were increasingly exposed to peer-victimization at eight years. Our results resemble earlier findings showing that preschool children with communication impairment, language difficulties and language disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McCormack et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rennecke et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Øksendal et al., 2019)</ref>, and school children with language difficulties and language disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Durkin &amp; Conti-Ramsden, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Redmond, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">van den Bedem et al., 2018)</ref>, are at increased risk of peer-victimization. Our results strengthen the validity of these findings by showing that the association between poor language skills and peer-victimizations still holds after adjusting for earlier measures of language skills and peer-victimization. Thus, indicating that these associations persist across time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rice et al. (1991)</ref> found that preschool children with limited communication skills use shorter sentences, are less preferred communication partners, and communicate more with adults compared with TD children. Consequently, these children could be less included in social interactions and play-activities peers.</p><p>Another study found that private speech among pre-schoolers predicted social skills and behavior difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Winsler et al., 2003)</ref>. Abdul <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aziz et al. (2017)</ref> found that young children with SLI use less private speech on problem-solving tasks compared to their TD peers. Children with language difficulties may therefore appear less mature and more frustrated when interacting with peers, which could make them more prone to peer-victimization. Moreover, language is an important means for children to express if something is troubling them. It is therefore possible that young children with language difficulties struggle to reveal incidents of peer-rejection or peer-problems to parents, teachers or caregivers. Consequently, these incidences may persist and develop into peer-victimization.</p><p>Finally, our results show an association between peer-victimization at five years and language skills at eight years. Thus, indicating that peer-victimization measured at five years predicted poor language skills at eight years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Helland et al. (2018)</ref> found bidirectional associations between language difficulties and internalizing difficulties from 18 months through eight years of age. It is therefore possible that peer-victimization influence internalizing difficulties, which in turn influence poor language skills. As expected, our results show that children with persistent language difficulties from three though eight years had the highest risk of peer-victimization and bully-perpetration. Likewise, for children with poor language skills at three years the association to peer-victimization/bully-perpetration at eight years was mediated by poor language skills at five years. This indicates that persistent language difficulties increase peer-victimization and involvement in bully-perpetration. St Clair et al.</p><p>(2011) found that children with specific language impairment (SLI), measured from seven through 16 years of age, showed increasing levels of peer-difficulties. However, this study did not investigate whether children with different developmental paths of SLI were differently associated with peer-difficulties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McCormack et al. (2011)</ref> included 24% of their sample as children with communication difficulties. Thus, even when applying a wider estimate of communication difficulties than is commonly used in the literature, they still found that these children were more exposed to peervictimization. However, mild difficulties were not investigated separately.</p><p>Our results expand current knowledge by showing an increased risk of peervictimization from five to eight years and bully-perpetration at eight years for children with late onset language difficulties and mild language difficulties, and an increased risk of peer-victimization from five to eight years for children with transient language difficulties. Accordingly, our results show that the associations between poor language skills at three years and peer-victimization/bully-perpetration at eight years were mediated by peer-victimization at five years. Previous studies have found that late talking toddlers exhibit lower social and emotional competence compared to their TD peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Irwin et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Longobardi et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, revealing an early vulnerability to peer-related problems. Although bullying behavior generally decreases from preschool to school age, some children show persistent trajectories of peervictimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ladd et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Oncioiu et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, research has found that early experiences of peer-victimization may lead to bully-perpetration <ref type="bibr">(Lereya et al., 2015)</ref>. It is therefore possible that children with transient language difficulties or poor language skills at three years will be targeted already as preschoolers, which in turn could make them more prone to peer-victimization and bully-perpetration in school years, despite possible language skills improvements.</p><p>Our results highlight the need for more awareness about children that struggle with language, without necessarily having persistent developmental paths of language difficulties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Glogowska et al. (2006)</ref> found that many preschoolers with language delay that were not prioritized for professional support still showed increased literacy struggles and peer-related struggles when measured as schoolchildren compared to their age matched peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glogowska et al., 2006)</ref>. Children with mild or fleeting paths of language difficulties could have difficulties that are less obvious for parents and professionals. Consequently, peer-problems and social struggles may go unnoticed and develop into peer-victimization and bully-perpetration among these children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>The current study used a large population-based sample to investigate the associations between language difficulties, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration across time. First, associations between language difficulties and bully-perpetration have rarely been investigated. Hence, our findings give new knowledge about these associations. Second, language difficulties were measured with both categorical and with latent variables. Latent variables, which accounted for measurement error and the non-normal distribution of the items, were included in an autoregressive cross-lagged model. Using latent variables could therefore make the estimates in our model more reliable. In addition, our model gave us the opportunity to discuss longitudinal associations between language skills, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration. Last, by using both latent variables and categorical variables, our results give robust support for the vulnerability of children language difficulties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adachi and Willoughby (2015)</ref> argue that controlling for the stability of effects is the gold standard of longitudinal designs. This is because it allows the researchers to examine if the variables of interest predict the outcome over time, while controlling for earlier measures of the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adachi &amp; Willoughby, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, when controlling for measurement stability, it was possible to examine how language skills predicted change in peer-victimization measured prospectively.</p><p>However, an important critique of the cross-lagged model is that it is not possible to separate the within-person stability from between-person stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hamaker et al., 2015)</ref>. Intra-individual differences such as family or child characteristics could therefore reflect the stability of our measurements. As shown in tables 1 and 2, many of the children with language difficulties in our study also had cooccurring difficulties such as attention difficulties/hyperactivity, behavioral difficulties and emotional difficulties. Research has shown that children with these difficulties are more often exposed to peer-victimization and involved in bully-perpetration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arseneault et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Verlinden et al., 2015)</ref>. It is therefore possible that cooccurring difficulties, rather than merely the language ability, could explain the associations between language difficulties and peer-victimization/bully-perpetration found in our study. However, given that the association between language difficulties and co-occurring difficulties is apparent from such an early age <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helland et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wang et al., 2018)</ref>, we argue that our findings show the observed association to peervictimization/bully-perpetration that children with language difficulties experience in their natural environment. In addition, we have previously found that children with language difficulties without co-occurring difficulties had an increased risk of peer-victimization <ref type="bibr">(Øksendal et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, indicating that the association with peervictimization not only applies to children with co-occurring difficulties.</p><p>Many of the estimates in our model are small according to conventional standards. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adachi and Willoughby (2015)</ref> have demonstrated that controlling for measurement stability can reduce effect size coefficients in SEM. Accordingly, many of our coefficients shown as unadjusted correlations (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) were greatly reduced in our autoregressive cross-lagged model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). In addition, our results resemble previous findings by showing moderate to high stability of poor language skills from three, five to eight years <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helland et al., 2018)</ref>, and peer-victimization from preschool to school age <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ladd et al., 2017)</ref>. The amount of change in peer-victimization that results from poor language skills is therefore expected to be modest. Still, small effect sizes can be important <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McCartney &amp; Rosenthal, 2000)</ref>. Our results indicate ongoing cumulative associations between poor language skills, peer-victimization and bullyperpetration. The negative consequences of peer-victimization and bully-perpetration have been established in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arseneault et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wolke et al., 2013)</ref>. Our findings therefore give new knowledge as to whom might be early targets.</p><p>Our study is among the first to investigate the risk of peer-victimization and bully-perpetration among children with different developmental paths of language difficulties and children with mild language difficulties. This was done by creating groups of children with persistent, transient, late onset and mild language difficulties. Unfortunately, some of these groups were small. This resulted in large CIs for some of our ORs. Point estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution bearing in mind the full range of the CI.</p><p>Given that MoBa is a population-based longitudinal study, selective attrition is an important concern. Previous research has found that using a sample that includes at least some of the most troubled individuals with the most severe difficulties could moderate bias due to selective non-response in longitudinal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gustavson et al., 2019)</ref>. Our sample contains variations with high and low rates of language skills. This could reduce self-selection bias owing to attrition. Moreover, possible self-selection bias in MoBa has been examined by investigating differences in prevalence estimates between MoBa participants and Norwegian mothers. MoBa participants tend to have better health and socioeconomic status compared to Norwegian mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Nilsen et al., 2009)</ref>. Self-selection bias could therefore influence exposure-outcome estimates in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Biele et al., 2019)</ref>. However, when tested using both actual data and simulations, even large selection bias may have little effect on the regression coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Wolke, Waylen, et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Parents are reliable informants on their child's language development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lyytinen et al., 1996)</ref> and their child's involvement in peer-victimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shakoor et al., 2011)</ref>. In our study, mothers were assessing language, peer-victimization and bully-perpetration. Consequently, shared variance due to stable characteristics belonging to the mother could influence our estimates. Direct measures of language ability and supplementary measures of peer-victimization/bully-perpetration from the teacher or child would probably strengthen our results but was not available. Last, language and peer-victimization were measured somewhat differently at different ages, and measurement invariance could not be established between boys and girls. This could threaten the comparability of our variables across time and between boys and girls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our findings give robust support for the vulnerability of children with language difficulties. Language difficulties in preschool years, in particular if stable and persistent, puts children at increased risk of both peer-victimization but also engagement in perpetrating bullying. An increased vulnerability was also found for children with mild and fleeting paths of language difficulties. An important finding was girls with poor language skills showed stronger associations to bullyperpetration compared to boys. Thus, highlighting the need to be aware that although more boys have difficulties, girls with poor language skills may be more involved in negative peer-interactions. Poor language skills and peer-victimization were both found to be moderately stable over time. Parents and teachers should be aware that children with language difficulties measured in preschool and school years are more exposed to peer-victimization and more involved in bully-perpetration measured concurrently and prospectively.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Descriptive statistics for the different developmental paths of language difficulties Note.

MoBa is a prospective population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Magnus et al., 2016) (https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/). Participants were recruited from all over Norway between 1999-2008. Mothers that were invited to participate consented to participation in 41% of the pregnancies. The cohort now includes 114 500 children and 95 200 mothers. Information on health, lifestyle and child development was collected by questionnaires during pregnancy and after birth. For the present study, 22 628 children (11 500 boys and 11 128 girls) with complete questionnaires at three, five and eight years of age were included. The tenth, quality assured version of the dataset released in 2017 was used in the current study. The establishment of MoBa and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority and approval from The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics. The MoBa cohort is based on regulations from the Norwegian Health Registry Act. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has approved this study.</figDesc></figure>
