<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Adjusting for latent covariates is crucial for estimating causal effects from observational textual data. Most existing methods only account for confounding covariates that affect both treatment and outcome, potentially leading to biased causal effects. This bias arises from insufficient consideration of non-confounding covariates, which are relevant only to either the treatment or the outcome. In this work, we aim to mitigate the bias by unveiling interactions between different variables to disentangle the non-confounding covariates when estimating causal effects from text. The disentangling process ensures covariates only contribute to their respective objectives, enabling independence between variables. Additionally, we impose a constraint to balance representations from the treatment group and control group to alleviate selection bias. We conduct experiments on two different treatment factors under various scenarios, and the proposed model significantly outperforms recent strong baselines. Furthermore, our thorough analysis on earnings call transcripts demonstrates that our model can effectively disentangle the variables, and further investigations into real-world scenarios provide guidance for investors to make informed decisions 1 .</p><p>1 Our code and data are released at <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/zyxnlp/DIVA">https://github.com/ zyxnlp/DIVA</ref>.</p></div>

For example, to estimate the effect of "political risk" (treatment) faced by a company on its "stock movement" (outcome). Early research efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abadie and Imbens, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bardone-Cone and Cass, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kurth et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Murnane and Willett, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Keele, 2015)</ref> focusing on conducting randomized control trials (RCTs) to estimate causal effects from structural numeric data have made significant progress. However, these methods requires extensive effort in treatment assignment mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Halloran and Struchiner, 1995)</ref> and may suffer from ethical issues. Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers are increasingly interested in estimating causal effects from observational unstructured text. Early literature <ref type="bibr">(Choudhury et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Olteanu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pryzant et al., 2018)</ref> largely focuses on transforming texts into high-dimensional vectors using lexical features for confounding adjustment. Recent research primarily focuses on learning adequate representations through advanced NLP models. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veitch et al. (2020)</ref> fine-tuned BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> to produce contextual text representations for efficient estimation of causal effects. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pryzant et al. (2021)</ref> introduced strategies involving treatment enhancement and text adjustment to estimate the causal effects related to linguistic properties.</p><p>Despite their efficacy, such approaches operate under the assumption that text solely encompasses confounding covariates. This assumption raises a potential issue due to the possible existence of unobserved non-confounding covariates that are pertain exclusively to either the treatment or the outcome. The causal estimation may be biased if we fail to differentiate non-confounding covariates from confounding ones when learning an estimation function through effective modeling of variable interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Pearl, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wooldridge, 2016)</ref>. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, if we aim to accurately estimate the causal effects of treatment T (e.g, Political Risk) on the outcome Y (e.g., Stock Movement), we intentionally omit the consideration of the impacts originating from Z y (e.g., Expected Revenue). This mirrors our decision not to account for the influence of Z c (e.g., Geographical Location) on Y , as such inclusion could obfuscate our ability to discern the true effects originating from T .</p><p>In this paper, we propose a framework named Disentangling Interaction of VAriables (DIVA), specifically tailored for causal inference from text. We assume that the text carries sufficient information to identify the causal effects and consider the existence of non-confounding covariates. Drawing on the success of latent variable models for causal inference in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Louizos et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, we use Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014) to infer confounding and non-confounding covariates. Additionally, we design a disentanglement module to ensure that covariates only contribute to their specific objectives, enabling independence between covariates. Furthermore, we propose to impose a constraint to balance representations from the treatment group and control group, which helps to mitigate selection bias.</p><p>Our contributions are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We propose the Disentangling Interaction of VAriables (DIVA) approach, tailored to mitigate the bias issue in causal inference from text. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Causal estimation with text data Early efforts in estimating causal effects from text focused on using lexical features for confounding adjustment <ref type="bibr">(Choudhury et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Choudhury and Kıcıman, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Olteanu et al., 2017)</ref>. Later studies investigating causal effects were devoted to effectively converting text into low-dimensional representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Falavarjani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pham and Shen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pryzant et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Weld et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2021)</ref>. Another line of work focused on using causal formalisms to make NLP methods more reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wood-Doughty et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Feder et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feder et al., , 2022))</ref>. Most recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> significantly benefited causal estimation. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veitch et al. (2020)</ref> fine-tuned BERT using multi-task learning to produce contextual text representations for efficient estimation of causal effects. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pryzant et al. (2021)</ref> introduced treatment-boosting and text-adjusting strategies to estimate the causal effects of linguistic properties.</p><p>Our work differs from these works in three main aspects. First, we aim to mitigate the bias that arises from insufficient consideration of non-confounding covariates in causal inference. Second, we disentangle non-confounding covariates by encouraging independence among the variables, ensuring that each one contributes solely to its respective objective. Third, we introduce regularization to balance representations from the treatment group and control group, which helps to mitigate selection bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal inference with latent variable model</head><p>Latent variable models have demonstrated their effectiveness and gained significant popularity in causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fong and Grimmer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sridhar and Getoor, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Louizos et al. (2017)</ref> used Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kingma and Welling, 2014)</ref> to infer confounders from latent space to estimate the effect of job training on employment following the training. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rakesh et al. (2018)</ref> inferred the causation that leads to spillover effects between pairs of units by incorporating VAE to learn the latent attributes as confounders. We follow the line of decomposing latent factors for causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hassanpour and Greiner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vowels et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>. However, there are several key distinctions in our approach. Firstly, while previous studies attempted to disentangle variables for causal inference in structured numeric data, we specifically focus on estimating causal effects from textual data. The inherently high-dimensional nature of text features presents substantial challenges in disentangling various variables within the latent space, leading to biased causal estimations. Secondly, we tailor distinct constraints to effectively model interactions among diverse variables, ensuring that each variable primarily contributes to its specific objective and promotes maximal independence. Lastly, we optimize the maximum mean discrepancy loss to achieve a balanced representation of samples from both treatment and control groups.</p><p>NLP for earnings call transcripts Earnings call transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frankel et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Price et al., 2011)</ref> have gained much popularity in financial analysis using NLP tools. Early work by Wang and Hua (2014) formulated financial risk prediction as a text regression task and used handcrafted features to improve SVM performance. Later, researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Qin and Yang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sawhney et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sang and Bao, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pataci et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shah et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yang et al., 2022)</ref> focused on stock prediction by employing sophisticated neural networks with financial pragmatic features. Another line of work focused on analyzing the content of earnings call transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sawhney et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alhamzeh et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keith and Stent (2019)</ref> examined analysts' decision-making behavior as it pertains to the language content of earnings calls. More in line with our work, Hassan et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) adapted linguistic tools to investigate the extent of political risk faced by firms over time and its correlation with stocks, hiring, and investment. In contrast with this prior work, our primary focus lies on estimating causal effects between financial interests, such as the impact of political risk on stocks, rather than measuring their correlations.</p></div>

T i = 1 indicates that the ith example belongs to the treatment group (e.g., a company faced high political risk). Conversely, T i = 0 indicates that the i-th example belongs to the control group (e.g., a company faced low or no political risk). The causal effect τ i for the ith example is defined as the expected difference between its potential outcome Y i (e.g., stock volatility) of the treatment and control groups, known as the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ i = Y i (T i = 1) -Y i (T i = 0) (1)</formula><p>One of the most challenging problems in estimating causal effects from observational data is the impossibility of simultaneously observing both potential outcomes Y i (T i = 0) and Y i (T i = 1) for a given example <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rubin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Holland, 1985)</ref>. In other words, D only includes the observed outcome Y i for each example, but not the unobserved counterfactual outcome, which refers to the potential outcome for the i-th example in the alternative group.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DIVA: Disentangling Interaction of VAriables</head><p>In this section, we present the proposed Disentangling Interaction of VAriables (DIVA) framework (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) for causal inference from textual earnings call transcripts. Although previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Veitch et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pryzant et al., 2021)</ref> has explored estimating causal effects from text, one of the core contributions of our work is that we disentangle various variables to effectively model the interactions among them. This in turn enables us to learn a more accurate estimation function Q for predicting outcomes, thereby reducing the bias in the causal estimation.</p><p>Our proposed DIVA framework consists of a few steps. First, we extract the contextualized text representation from the pre-trained language model. Following that, we employ a variational auto-encoder to determine the posterior distribution for various latent variables. Once this distribution is obtained, we use the variable disentanglement module to encourage independence among the variables, ensuring that each one contributes solely to its respective objective. Next, we utilize the disentangled variables to learn the Q function via the outcome prediction task. Finally, we plug the trained Q into a pre-determined statistic to estimate the ATE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Text Encoder</head><p>Given a transcript x = [w 1 , ..., w n ] that consists of n words, we adopt the pre-trained language (PLM) model FinBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Araci, 2019)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> to obtain the contextual representation h for each transcript:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h = PLM(x)</formula><p>(5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Latent Variable Inducer</head><p>Inspired by recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Louizos et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, we use the VAE to induce latent variables. Given the contextualized representation h. We compute the approximation variational posterior q ϕ (z|h) using the inference network Φ(h; ϕ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">µ = W µ h + b µ log σ 2 = W σ h + b σ z = µ + σ ⊙ ϵ (6)</formula><p>where W µ , W σ , b µ , and b σ are parameters for two MLPs. µ and σ define a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, and ϵ ∼ N (0, I). Then, we sample from q ϕ (z|h) ≃ N (µ, σ 2 I) to generate z ∈ R l as the latent representation, where l is the dimension of the representation. Under the assumption that a transcript contains not only the confounding covariates, which affects both treatment and outcome, but also the non-confounding covariates specific to either the treatment or the outcome, we use separate inference networks Φ c (h; ϕ c ) for inferring confounding covariates z c , and Φ t (h; ϕ t ) and Φ y (h; ϕ y ) for inferring non-confounding covariates z t and z y , respectively. We use a one-layer parameterized MLP Θ(h; θ) := p θ (h|z t , z c , z y )</p><p>as the decoder to reconstruct h. The objective of the latent variable inducer is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L vae = E Φt,Φc,Φy [log Θ(h; θ)]- k KL(Φ k ||p(z k )) (7)</formula><p>where k ∈ {c, t, y}, and p(z k ) is the prior follows the Gaussian distribution N (0, I).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Latent Variable Disentanglement</head><p>Despite the successful application of decomposing variables in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, unfortunately, the high-dimensional nature of text features presents significant obstacles in disentangling different variables in a latent space, leading to biased causal estimation. As will be shown in Section 5.2 (e.g., TEDVAE v.s. CEVAE), considering only non-confounding covariates, without the ability to effectively model interactions between different variables, fails to consistently achieve better performance in textual data.</p><p>To address this issue, we tailor various distinct constraints to effectively disentangle nonconfounding covariates from confounding ones, ensuring that each variable primarily contributes to its specific objective and promotes maximal independence.</p><p>Specifically, we first minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gretton et al., 2012)</ref> loss to balance representations from the treatment group and the control group:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L mmd = k∈{c,t,y} M(z treat k ; z contl k )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where M(; ) denotes the maximum mean discrepancy metric. z treat k and z contl k are the representations in the treatment group and the control group, respectively. The nice property of this loss is that minimizing the loss essentially reduces the discrepancy between different groups, encouraging the satisfaction of the positivity assumption. Concurrently, it promotes the inference network to generalize from the factual to counterfactual domains, leading to better counterfactual inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Johansson et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Next, we introduce an orthogonal loss to maximize the independence between z t , z c , and z y as much as possible:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L ort = k,v Orth(z k ; z v )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where k, v ∈ {t, c, y; k</p><formula xml:id="formula_11"≯ = v}. Orth(z k ; z v ) = ||z k • z T v -I||,</formula><p>and I is the identity matrix. Intuitively, we expect that the prediction of the treatment label should primarily rely on z t and z c , rather than z y . To ensure this holds, we introduce the treatment loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L t = log P (t|z y ) -log P (t|z t , z c ) (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where t ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether the transcript belongs to the treatment group. Similarly, we expect the prediction of outcome should primarily rely on z y and z c , and define the outcome loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L o = O(y, Q(t, z y , z c ))<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where y ∈ Y is the potential outcome. O is an MSE loss for real-valued outcomes and a crossentropy loss for the binary outcomes.</p><p>The overall objective function of the latent variable disentanglement module is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L d = L vae + αL t + βL o + γL ort + ηL mmd (12)</formula><p>where α, β, γ, and η are hyper-parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experiments on Synthetic Data Dataset</head><p>Since ground truth causal effects ITE τ i and ATE τ , are typically inaccessible in real-world scenarios, directly training a model for causal inference is impractical. Therefore, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veitch et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pryzant et al. (2021)</ref>, using real text and metadata to generate semi-synthetic data to empirically evaluate our proposed model. We collect 115,880 transcripts from 1,438 companies across twelve different sectors, for earnings calls held between May 2001 and October 2019. Then, we construct different datasets for two distinct treatment variablespolitical risk (T pr ) and sentiment (T s ) -under two separate scenarios: stock volatility (Y vol ) and stock movement (Y mov ). To derive T pr , we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hassan et al. (2017)</ref> to calculate the political risk score<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> for each transcript. We then select the top 15,000 transcripts with the highest scores as the treatment group (T pr = 1), indicating that the company faces high political risk. Conversely, we designate the bottom 15,000 transcripts with the lowest scores as the control group (T pr = 0), suggesting these companies face lower or no political risk. To derive T s , we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Maia et al. (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Araci (2019)</ref> to calculate the sentiment score<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> for each transcripts. We select the top 15,000 transcripts with the highest scores as the treatment group (T s = 1) and select the bottom 15,000 transcripts with the lowest scores as the control group (T s = 0). Finally, we simulate the outcomes by using the treatment variable T ∈ {T pr , T s } along with observed covariates, C size and C sect , which represent the size of the company in terms of the number of full-time employees and the industrial sector that the company operates. The best results on each dataset are in bold. The second-best ones are underlined. The † marker indicates that the p-value is less than 0.05 compared to the second-best results.The parameter setting used is (α=1, β=1, γ=0.5, ϵ=1) for Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">15</ref>).</p><p>be simulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Y vol = α v T + β v1 (π(C sect ) -γ v0 ) + β v2 (π(C size ) -γ v1 ) + ϵ v<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The binary stock movement (Up or Down), Y mov can be simulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Y mov ∼ Bernoulli(σ(α m T + β m1 (π(C sect ) -γ m0 ) + β m2 (π(C size ) -γ m1 ) + ϵ m ))<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where π(C size ) and π(C sect ) are propensity socres estimated from meta data. α v and α m control treatment strength. β v1 , β v2 , β m1 , and β m1 control confound strength. γ v1 , γ v2 , γ m1 , and γ m2 are offset. σ is the sigmoid function.</p><p>We split the dataset into the training, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:6 ratio and conduct experiments in a cross-validated manner, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Egami et al. (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pryzant et al. (2021)</ref>. We conduct experiments for the two different treatment variable T pr and T s under the scenarios of stock volatility and stock movement, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Results</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, DragonNet and CFRNet generally achieve better results than TARNet, suggest-ing that additional constraints indeed benefit the outcome regression model in causal estimation. For example, DragonNet improves upon the TARNet by 0.03 in terms of δATE based on political risk in the stock volatility scenario. We also observe that Causalbert and TextCause generally achieve better results than the deep outcome regression models such as TARNet, DragonNet, and CFRNet, as well as latent variable models such as CEVAE and TEDVAE. This suggests that the inclusion of the masked language modeling task has a positive impact on causal inference from text. Our model consistently outperforms all compared baseline models across both evaluation metrics and under both scenarios. For instance, DIVA demonstrates a significant improvement (with p &lt; 0.05) over the bestperforming baseline TextCause and the CausalBert model.</p><p>Interestingly, we observe that TEDVAE struggles to consistently outperform CEVAE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent Covariates Analysis</head><p>To further investigate the influence of various covariates on model performance, we conduct an in-depth analysis of DIVA, focusing on the disentanglement of different covariates. As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, merely disentangling non-confounding covariates z t or z y from the confounding covariate z c fails to consistently achieve better results compared to considering only z c . Our model yields the best performance with the simultaneous disentanglement of z t , z c , and z y . This results underscore the necessity of comprehensive covariate disentanglement, specifically, disentangling both non-confounding covariates z t and z y from the confounding covariate z c , as opposed to a partial or singular focus.</p></div>

Result As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we observe that the causal effects of political risk on stock increases in the short term (3 days) and begin to decline over time. Conversely, the causal effect of sentiment on stock movement decreases over time.</p><p>Analysis To further investigate the effect of political risks on the stock market for different types of companies, we examine the causal effect of political risk faced by companies in different sectors on their stock prices. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows that the stock volatility of companies in Industrials Goods, Real Estate, and Energy are most significantly affected by the political risk they faced, while companies in Consumer Cyclical and Technology are affected to the smallest extent. The political risks faced by the Healthcare companies have no effect on their stock volatility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose DIVA, a novel framework designed specifically for causal inference from text. We verify its effectiveness by estimating the causal effects of treatment factor (e.g., political risk or sentiment) on a company's stock (e.g., stock volatility or movement) from the earnings conference call transcripts. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively disentangle representations with different functionalities from text features by imposing constraints and utilizing multi-task learning. Furthermore, our analysis of real-world applications highlights the causal relationship between political risks faced by a company and its stock prices, providing valuable insights for the finance and investment industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our work has a number of limitations. First, we constructed a balanced dataset in which the number of transcripts in the treatment group is equal to that in the control group. While this facilitated relatively easier causal estimation, it does not account for the selection bias that commonly exists in realworld scenarios. Consequently, causal estimation in such scenarios becomes more challenging. Second, we modeled the relation between treatment factors and stocks as a linear relation. However, in reality, this relationship is likely to be much more complex and nonlinear. A more precise modeling of this relationship would enhance the accuracy of our causal estimation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The causal diagram for our proposed model.
