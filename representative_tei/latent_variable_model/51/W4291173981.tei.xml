<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic has been raging around the globe for more than two years, which has caused waves of infections and deaths among countries. The pandemic has prompted the development of vaccines which have been clinically administrated in various countries since early 2021. Ten COVID-19 vaccines had been approved for public use by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of January 2022. Vaccine makers have provided clinical trial results on the effectiveness of their products. The vaccine effectiveness against the original SARS-Cov-2 strain from recent studies is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S1</ref>, which ranged from 50.7% to 95% for the two-dose vaccination. However, SARS-CoV-2 has undergone progressive changes. The Delta variant has caused global pandemics with a high transmission rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Planas et al., 2021)</ref>, resulting in considerable socioeconomic burden and pressure on hospital systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>There is a great need to evaluate the vaccine efficacy (VE) in the real-world situation. Clinical trials used to evaluate the VE exclude certain part of the population and are difficult to control all confounding factors that may cause infections in the population. The retrospective studies, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2021)</ref>, used the proportion of the vaccine breakthrough cases in all infected cases in specific institutions, which typically had a small sample size relative to the daily infections in a country. Moreover, most countries do not collect vaccine breakthrough statistics, which brings great challenges for evaluating vaccine effects in real-world situations. In addition, many studies have only provided data on effectiveness against symptomatic cases as including asymptomatic ones is difficult. Hence, the real-world performance against any infection is an important issue.</p><p>Compartmental models, like SIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kermack and McKendrick, 1927)</ref> and SEIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson and May, 1982)</ref> models, are widely used for modeling the transmission of infectious diseases, which divide a population into compartments and specify the transition rates among compartments by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Stochastic epidemic models (SEMs) extended from the SEIR model had been proposed to study the spread of COVID-19 before vaccines were available <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tian et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yan et al., 2021)</ref>. As asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections in the COVID-19 pandemic are not observable, the likelihood functions based on the observed data are rather complex due to having to integrate out unobserved state variables. Bayesian methods which target the joint posterior distribution of the unobserved data and the model parameters use the Markov chain Monte Carlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Auranen et al., 2000)</ref> or the sequential Monte Carlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dukic, Lopes and Polson, 2012)</ref> for parameter estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Quick, Dey and Lin (2021)</ref> built a multilevel regression model on the COVID-19 daily confirmed infection counts, polymerase chain reaction testing and serological survey data, and developed an EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters.</p><p>There are recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dashtbali and Mirzaie, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giordano et al., 2021)</ref> in evaluating COVID-19 vaccination strategies using a deterministic compartment model that assumes a portion of the vaccinated can achieve permanent and full immunity, which is quite restrictive. Moreover, deterministic models are inadequate to facilitate statistical inference on the characteristics of epidemics. Incorporating stochasticity into epidemic models is needed for real-world evaluation due to the randomness of the state variables. There has been no study using the publicly available data to estimate the real-world COVID-19 VE without the restrictive permanent and full immunity assumption and incorporating the stochastic natures of the epidemics and the unobservable asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases.</p><p>We propose a new SEM for evaluating COVID-19 vaccine efficacy based on the publicly available epidemiological and vaccination data, which allows breakthroughs in fully and partially immunized people, and infection before clinical diagnosis and being asymptomatic. The advantages of our proposal over the traditional cohort or case-control studies are in its much-reduced data collection cost and timely assessment on the real-world performance of vaccines.</p><p>The unavailability of data on breakthrough cases and infections before clinical confirmation brings challenges to estimating real-world vaccine effects. To tackle the challenges, this study proposes a decentralized estimation approach that utilizes different periods of the data series for estimating different parameters, taking advantage of long observations of the COVID-19 epidemics. Unobservable compartments are imputed by data on observed compartments based on the proposed stochastic model. A major part of the estimation is attained by minimizing certain contrast functions between the imputed and the simulation-based estimates for the infected to estimate (i) the diagnosis rate using the pre-vaccine period data, and (ii) the vaccine effect parameters using the post-vaccine period data. The final time-varying infection rate is estimated by the kernel smoothing method based on the model-implied imputation equations.</p><p>We apply the proposed model and estimation approach to analyze the data from ten countries to estimate the real-world VEs and other key parameters. It is found that the VEs of partial (one dose) vaccination ranged from 48% to 64% and 17.5% to 48% in the pre-Delta and the Delta dominated periods, respectively. The VEs of the full (usually two-dose) vaccination ranged from 68% to 95% in the pre-Delta era, which were reduced to 45% to 74% when the Delta variant dominated. The average VEs from the full vaccination were at least 22% more than those of the partial vaccination, suggesting significant extra protection offered by the full vaccination. Furthermore, the full vaccination efficacy for the 10 countries up to November 20, 2021 (before the Omicron era) was largely above the WHO recognized 50% level with all 8 brands of the vaccines, including inactivated vaccines. Our results of the mixed effectiveness of vaccines being administrated simultaneously in a country were consistent with those of published studies via clinical trials and the retrospective studies reviewed in the supplementary material (SM).</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the data used in this study and the periods with respect to vaccination and the pandemic. Section 3 presents the proposed stochastic epidemic model with vaccination compartments. The multi-step decentralized estimation and inference procedure is given in Section 4. Section 5 reports simulation results to evaluate the proposed method. Sections 6 and 7 provide the empirical analysis on the estimated vaccine effects in three periods of the pandemic, and the scenario analysis results for the no-vaccine, partial-vaccination and first-dose-priority scenarios, respectively. Section 8 concludes the paper.</p><p>2. Data. We analysed the publicly available epidemiological data from February 23, 2020 to November 20, 2021 of 10 countries listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">S3</ref> of the SM. The first date marked the start of the local transmission in these countries, while the second date represented the end of the pre-Omicron era as Omicron was first reported on November 24, 2021. The daily epidemiological statistics were obtained from "the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard" at Johns Hopkins University, and the information on the vaccine types and the cumulative numbers of people receiving one or two vaccine doses was obtained from the official statistics of the countries. In this paper, the full dose means one dose in the case of Janssen and two doses for the other brands.</p><p>Some countries (Canada, Italy, Portugal, the UK, the US) under-reported their daily recovery cases almost from the beginning of the pandemics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Yan et al., 2021)</ref> as reflected in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> of the SM. Moreover, recoveries in all the 10 countries have not been reported since August, 2021. Thus, we used 14 days as the average time of recovery, as suggested by WHO and supported clinically by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guan et al. (2020)</ref>, to impute the recovered cases for these countries. The daily data were smoothed to reduce potential measurement errors using the procedure outlined in the SM.</p><p>For each country, we studied four sequential and non-overlapping periods of the pandemic: the pre-vaccine period from the start of the epidemic till the start of vaccination, the pre-Delta period till the Delta variant was first detected in the country, the intervening period till the Delta variant became predominant and the Delta dominated period when the majority of the cases were caused by the Delta variant. India did not have the pre-Delta period as its first Delta case was reported before vaccination. The dates of the periods in the countries are provided in the SM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Epidemiological Model.</head><p>We propose a new SEM called varying coefficient susceptiblevaccinated-infected-diagnosed-removed (vSVIADR) model with ten compartments for a well-mixed population of size M . The proposed model with its compartments and key parameters is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It shows that in addition to the latent asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic compartments before diagnosis considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yan et al. (2021)</ref>, we add the partially and fully vaccine immunized compartments to model the transmission after vaccination. This allows to estimate the VE in real-world situations using daily statistics of epidemics and vaccination. As the types, supplies and distribution strategies of vaccines vary from country to country, such an estimation would better reflect the actual VE in a given population than the estimates from the experimental studies using clinical trial data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Voysey et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Polack et al., 2020)</ref> or the retrospective studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sheikh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Let V 0 (t), V 1 (t), V 2 (t)</formula><p>, V e (t) be counts at day t of four uninfected sub-populations having received no vaccine, with partial, full and expired vaccine immunity; and I a (t) and I p (t) be the counts of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, respectively, where the asymptomatic cases are never diagnosed, and the pre-symptomatic cases will be tested and confirmed in a future date, but not yet diagnosed at time t. The latter two compartments start two epidemiological pathways with that from asymptomatic I a (t) leading to the self recovered R a (t), and the symptomatic pathway from I p (t) to the diagnosed D(t), then to the recovered R r (t) and the dead R d (t).

However, as some compartments are latent, Model (1) is not enough to determine the joint distribution of the state variables. More on the in-flow and out-flow of the state variables are needed to specify the data generation.</p><p>Let ∆S - I (t), ∆V - 1,I (t) and ∆V - 2,I (t) be the numbers of daily infected people from the three compartments S, V 1 and V 2 on day t, respectively; ∆V - 1,L (t) and ∆V - 2,L (t) be the daily increments of people losing immunity from V 1 (t) and V 2 (t), respectively; and ∆I + a (t) be the number of daily new asymptomatic cases on day t, where + (-) means inflow (outflow) from a compartment. Furthermore, let N (t) = D(t) + R d (t) + R r (t) be the accumulative confirmed cases, G 1 (t) and G 2 (t) be the accumulative numbers of people who have received at least one dose of vaccine and who are fully vaccinated, respectively.</p><p>The following is the probabilistic specification of the vSVIADR model via mutually independent Poisson distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆S - I (t)|F t ∼ Poi{H(t, β t )S(t)}, ∆V - 1,I (t)|F t ∼ Poi{ϕκH(t, β t )V 1 (t)}, ∆V - 2,I (t)|F t ∼ Poi{κH(t, β t )V 2 (t)}, ∆I + a (t)|F t ∼ Binomial(∆S - I (t) + ∆V - 1,I (t) + ∆V - 2,I (t), 1 -θ) (2) ∆G 1 (t)|F t ∼ Poi{φ 1,t V 0 (t)}, ∆G 2 (t)|F t ∼ Poi{φ 2,t V 1 (t)}, ∆V - 1,L (t)|F t ∼ Poi{µ 1 V 1 (t)}, ∆V - 2,L (t)|F t ∼ Poi{µ 2 V 2 (t)}, ∆N (t)|F t ∼ Poi{αI p (t)} ∆R a (t)|F t ∼ Poi{γ r,t I a (t)}, ∆R r (t)|F t ∼ Poi{γ r,t D(t)}, ∆R d (t)|F t ∼ Poi{γ d,t D(t)}.</formula><p>The Poisson assumptions can be relaxed into other distributions to accommodate potential overdispersion as discussed in the conclusion section. Given the initial {S(1), V 1 (1), V 2 (1), I a (1), I p (1), D(1), R a (1), R r (1), R d (1)} and based on the transitional specification (2), the state variables progress according to Equation (A.3) in the SM which will be used to generate trajectories of the state variables for parameter estimation.</p><p>The infectious states in the vSVIADR model are the asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and diagnosed (I a , I p and D) with time-varying infection rates β Ia t , β Ip t and β D t , respectively. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are not diagnosed at t, and asymptomatic cases are never confirmed through the infection. Among the three infectious states, only the diagnosed is observable. Since the asymptomatic cases develop no symptom, and the diagnosed people are advised to isolate at home or hospitalized, we design a model such that the presymptomatic compartment is more contagious than the other two compartments. Specifically, we assume β Ia t = β D t = β Ip t /r for a known constant r &gt; 1, which was set as 5 following the specification in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gu et al. (2020)</ref> to avoid additional computational cost. It could be made unknown and estimated by minimizing a criterion function along with α in Section 4.2.</p><p>The full vaccination (one dose for Janssen or two does for the other brands) is assumed to reduce the infection rate by a factor κ ∈ [0, 1] relative to the unvaccinated, while the partial vaccination reduces the rate by ϕκ for a ϕ ∈ [0, 1/κ]. The VE is 1 -κ and 1 -ϕκ for the fully and partially vaccinated under the model, respectively. If the full vaccination is fully effective, then κ = 0, while κ = 1 for complete failure.</p><p>The model assumes temporary immunity via µ 1 and µ 2 as 1/µ 1 and 1/µ 2 specify the average lengths of immunity after the partial and full vaccination, respectively. As the vaccinated people with lost or expired immunity are unobservable, µ 1 and µ 2 can not be estimated from the daily epidemiological data, and their values have to be attained from clinical studies. We set µ 1 = 1/60 and µ 2 = 1/240 according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Doria-Rose et al. (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Johnson &amp; Johnson (2021)</ref>. It is noted that <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dashtbali and Mirzaie (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giordano et al. (2021)</ref> assumed µ 1 = µ 2 = 0 (permanent immunity) and a regular flow from susceptibles with full efficacy of vaccines. The time-varying vaccination rates φ 1,t and φ 2,t of the unvaccinated and uninfected, and the partially vaccine immunized and uninfected, respectively, can be estimated by the kernel smoothing on ∆G 1 (t) and ∆G 2 (t).</p><p>Under the vSVIADR model, θ ∈ (0, 1) is the daily proportion of the pre-symptomatic cases and α is the diagnostic rate from the pre-symptomatic state I p to the diagnosed state D. Implied from (2), the number of newly asymptomatic cases ∆I + a (t) given the daily new infections follows Binomial(∆S -</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I (t) + ∆V - 1,I (t) + ∆V - 2,I (t), 1 -θ).</formula><p>As the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are latent, similar as µ 1 and µ 2 , we determine the value of θ based on existing studies. The meta-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buitrago-Garcia et al. (2020)</ref> found 20% (CI: 17% -25%) of COVID-19 infections remained asymptomatic in 79 published studies, which led our setting θ = 0.8 in the analysis.</p><p>The effective reproduction number R t is a key indicator and quantifies the mean number of secondary infections generated per primary infection at t. Derivation in the SM shows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(3) R t = (1 -θ) β Ia t γ r,t + θ β Ip t α + β D t γ t S(t) + ϕκV 1 (t) + κV 2 (t) M</formula><p>under the vSVIADR model. When R t &gt; 1(&lt; 1), the epidemic is increasing (decreasing). From (3), R t is conventionally driven positively by the three infection rates {β Ia t , β Ip t , β D t }, and negatively by the diagnosis rate α, the removal rate γ t and the VEs represented by 1 -κ and 1 -ϕκ. That vaccine slowing down R t is seen by relocating ϕκV 1 (t) + κV 2 (t) from the susceptible population, as more people move from the group S(t) without vaccine immunity to the partially or fully vaccinated groups V 1 (t) and V 2 (t) with enhanced immunity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Estimation and inference. We consider the estimation of the model parameters α, β</head><p>Ip t , γ d,t , γ r,t , ϕ and κ for a country, which leads to the estimation of the effective reproduction number R t by (3) as well as the VEs. For each country, we denote its start date of the pandemic as t = 1, the start date of vaccination as T 1 , and the ending date as T . The observed data are <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yan et al. (2021)</ref> proposed a vary-coefficient compartment model for the pre-vaccine period, and a leave-one-out cross-validation criteria with a kernel smoothing procedure for estimating model parameters. The approach no longer works for the current situation with the vaccine compartments for two reasons. First, the proposed model in ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is more complex with more unobservable compartments than the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yan et al. (2021)</ref>. Second, there are more parameters to optimize in an objective function, which include the diagnosis rate α, vaccine effects ϕ and κ, and the infection rate β Ip t . New estimation method needs to be developed. The simulation-based estimation approach has been adopted to estimate parameters in deterministic ODEs from partially observed data or data with additive measurement errors. The single <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hicks and Ray, 1971)</ref> shooting method minimizes distance measures between the observed state variables and the simulated trajectories of the variables via the ODEs with respect to the parameter values. The multiple shooting method is similar except that it breaks the time domain into smaller intervals with extra initial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baake et al., 1992)</ref>. There are non-simulation-based estimation approaches for differential-equation-based models, which involve the generalized profiling estimation via B-splines expansions or the nonparametric regression estimate of model coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ramsay et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liang and Wu, 2008)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{D(t), R r (t), R d (t), G 1 (t), G 2 (t)} T t=1 .</formula><p>Our estimation faces several challenges. First of all, although the conditional means of the vSVIADR model are specified in the forms of ODEs, the estimation approaches of the ODEs with measurement errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Liang and Wu, 2008)</ref> are not applicable for the current stochastic model with much heterogeneity due to the conditional Poisson specification. Second, the unobservable compartments in the model and the complexity of the system exhibited by ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (A.3) make the maximum likelihood estimation and the EM algorithm, which involves integrating out the latent variables in the conditional distribution, difficult to be implemented, although the EM algorithm had been applied for the much simpler binomial epidemic chain model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker, 1997)</ref>. To meet these challenges, we propose a multi-step decentralized estimation procedure, which estimates the constant parameters α, ϕ and κ by minimizing certain criterion functions, and estimates the time-varying parameters by the nonparametric regression method. The decentralization implies using different periods of data to estimate different parameters as shown next.</p><p>4.1. Estimation of removal rates γ d,t and γ r,t . The estimation of the two removal parameters is the most straightforward among all the parameters, as the three compartments D(t), R r (t) and R d (t) involving the recovery process are observable largely because they are located at the end of the epidemiological process. From the Poisson increments of the daily new deaths ∆R d (t) and daily new recoveries ∆R r (t) specified in (2), we have E{∆R d (t)|D(t)} = γ d,t D(t) and E{∆R r (t)|D(t)} = γ r,t D(t). The time-varying nature of the parameters suggests the locally weighted kernel smoothing estimator of γ r,t and γ d,t by regressing ∆R r (t) and ∆R d (t) on D(t) without intercept, respectively. Specifically, the estimators are in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">γd,t = T -1 i=1 D(i)∆R d (i)B((t -i)/h d ) T -1 i=1 D(i) 2 B((t -i)/h d ) and γr,t = T -1 i=1 D(i)∆R r (i)B((t -i)/h r ) T -1 i=1 D(i) 2 B((t -i)/h r ) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where B(•) is a boundary kernel modified from a symmetric kernel, and h d and h r are the temporal smoothing bandwidths; see the SM for details. 4.2. Estimation of diagnosis rate α.

It is noted that the VE estimated in the Delta period was not against the Delta variant only, but against all strains that occurred in this period.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">2</ref> shows that the overall VEs of the full vaccination during the pre-Delta period in the 9 countries without India were 68%-95% (Average: 81%, SE: 4%) while those of the partial vaccination were 48%-64% (Average: 56%, SE: 2%), which suggested that the full vaccination would bring 12%-40% (Average:24%, SE: 4%) more VE than the partial vaccination. Hence, the full vaccination's VEs regardless of the brands and their combinations all passed the 50% threshold for being effective according to the WHO guideline (WHO, 2021), while the partial vaccination's VEs largely passed the threshold except Turkey whose was at 48%.</p><p>The full vaccination's VEs of the countries in the intervening period were 49%-87% (Average: 69%, SE 3%) and those of the partial vaccination were 23.5%-67.5% (Average: 47%, SE 4%), which were both significantly lower than those in the pre-Delta period. However, the full vaccination still offered 15%-33% (Average 22%, SE 2%) more protection than the partial one.  When the Delta variant was prevalent, the partial vaccination showed even lower VEs ranging from 17.5% to 48% (Average: 35%, SE 3%). Only the US's and Peru's partial VEs stayed above 40%. Thus, the partial vaccination was not sufficiently protective against the Delta strain in the ten countries, which was consistent with the findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2021)</ref> based on a small size retrospective study and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Planas et al. (2021)</ref> via investigating the neutralising capacity of sera from vaccine recipients. The VEs of the full vaccination during the Delta period were 45%-74% (Average: 59%, SE: 2%), with the highest being 74% (CI: 69% to 79%) in the US and the lowest 45% (CI: 40% to 50%) in Turkey. The full vaccination during the Delta period had 19.5%-36% (average 24%, SE 2%) premium beyond the partial vaccination, indicating the boosting effect of the full vaccination against the Delta variant.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">2</ref> indicates waning VEs as the Delta variant gradually became the dominant strain, whether for partial or full vaccination. Compared to the pre-Delta period, the VEs of full vaccination in the Delta dominated period for the 9 countries without India decreased by 10%-37% (average 21%, SE 3%), while those for partial vaccination decreased by 7%-30.5% (average 21%, SE 2%). Relative to the intervening period, the VEs of full vaccination in the Delta dominated period were reduced by 4%-14% (average 10%, SE 1%), and those of the partial vaccination by 1%-19.5% (average 12%, 2%). The average effectiveness of partial vaccination in the three periods was 23% (SE: 1%) less than that of the full vaccination, which was consistent with the findings in a test-negative case-control study in England <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bernal et al., 2021)</ref> and also the sera neutralising capacity study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Planas et al. (2021)</ref>.</p><p>Most of the ten countries used a mixed brand of vaccines. Our results suggested that the estimated VEs were similar among countries administrated with the same type of vaccines in a period. For example, the estimated VEs in Germany and Italy were close over the three periods for both partial and full vaccination. In addition to vaccine types, the VEs were also affected by the distribution strategy of different vaccines, and the SARS-Cov-2 variants in a country. Although we did not have access to these information, we will provide results on a distribution scenario with regards to the first dose of vaccine in the next section.</p><p>Over the three periods, the US had the highest VEs among the 10 countries, where two RNA-based vaccines Moderna and Pfizer were applied. Turkey where an inactivated vaccine was administrated had the lowest VEs in the intervening and Delta dominated period. These results were supported by two comprehensive analyses <ref type="bibr">(Cai et al., 2021a,b)</ref> on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines using the published test-negative designs and clinical trials, which found RNA-based vaccines' VE ranked first, followed by the viral vector vaccines and then the inactivated vaccines.</p><p>7. Scenario analysis. To evaluate community transmission of COVID-19 in the ten countries, we estimate the effective reproduction number R t via (3) under the vSVIADR model. The estimated R t curves are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">3 (a)</ref>, which shows a strong correlation between R t &gt; 1 and the substantial increase of the newly confirmed cases ∆N (t). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref> shows that the estimated R t was highly correlated with the estimated infection rates β Ip t , with the generally higher infection rates in the Delta dominated period as compared to the pre-Delta and intervening periods. For many countries, R t gradually dropped below 1 after vaccination in the pre-Delta period, but rose above 1 as the Delta variant became prevalent.</p></div>

Figure 3 (b)</formula><p>shows that the would-be R t curves were higher than those of the empirically observed R t defined in (3) after the start of vaccination, especially when the Delta variant was dominated. This suggests that vaccines contributed to reducing the effective reproduction number R t substantially in the Delta dominated period. The average empirically observed R t in the post-vaccine period for the 10 countries was 20% less than that of the would-be R t without vaccination.</p><p>Another way to evaluate the vaccine effects is to calculate the would-be confirmed cases and deaths under no vaccination at all and the partial vaccination only without going for the full vaccination. For each country, the two scenarios were created by dynamically generating the nine states from the proposed vSVIADR model under each scenario. Since the vaccine effects are accounted by {(ϕ i , κ i )} 3 i=1 , we used the empirically estimated diagnosis rate α, the infection rates βIp t , the recovery rates γr,t and the death rates γd,t shown in  Figures 3 (b) and S9. We set {(ϕ i , κ i )} 3 i=1 and {V 1 (t), V 2 (t), G 1 (t), G 2 (t)} T t=T1 to zero for the no-vaccination scenario, used the observed {G 1 (t)} T t=T1 and the estimates {( φi , κi )} 3 i=1 as well as making {V 2 (t), G 2 (t)} T t=T1 to zero for the partial-vaccination scenario. We also designed a first-dose-priority vaccination scenario which gave priority to the first dose, and then the second dose if there were remaining vaccines left for it. This design can be realized by using the estimates {( φi , κi )} 3 i=1 and changing the vaccination functions {G 1 (t)} T t=T1 to {min{G 1 (t) + G 2 (t), M }} T t=T1 and {G 2 (t)} T t=T1 to {max{G 1 (t) + G 2 (t) -M, 0}} T t=T1 . The simulated trajectories under the three scenarios were made based on (2) and (A.3) with the initial values { Ŝ α(T 1 ), V 1 (T 1 ), V 2 (T 1 ), Î α a (T 1 ), Î α p (T 1 ), Rα a (T 1 ), D(T 1 ), R r (T 1 ), R d (T 1 )}. And the simulations of the three scenarios were repeated 100 times for each country under each scenario.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">3</ref> provides the would-be increases in confirmed cases and deaths under the novaccine, partial-vaccine and first-dose-priority scenarios relative to the observed values. Comparing to the observations up to October 31, 2021, there would be 259 million increase in confirmed cases and 2.6 million increase in deaths for the 10 countries combined in the absence of vaccination, which would amount to 194% and 102% increase over the observed confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. Under the partial-vaccination scenario, there would be 117% and 62% increases in confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. The scenario would lead to the respective increases of 49% and 24% in the total confirmed cases and deaths, indicating it would not be a better strategy than the existing one used by the countries, although the increases in Brazil, Italy and Peru were not significant. The details on the number of the would-be increases are reported in Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> in the SM. The increase in the cases and deaths would have been particularly phenomenal for Canada, Germany and the USA, with 333-769% increases in confirmed cases and 109-376% increases in deaths under the no-vaccine scenario. In a sharp contrast, the would-be increases in both the cases and deaths in India and Peru were rather small. These were due to, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>, the much lower vaccination rates in Peru (46%) and India (23%), as compared with the other countries.</p><p>The actual and the average would-be confirmed cases and deaths generated under the three scenarios are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref> in the SM, which shows that the gaps between the would-be and the observed grew with respect to time for most countries and scenarios especially in the Delta dominated period due to the higher would-be R t in almost all countries. These are another reflection on the vaccines' effect in reducing the epidemics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion.</head><p>This paper proposes a stochastic epidemiological model and an estimation procedure to evaluate vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 infection based on publicly available data. The real-world evaluation of vaccine efficacy is operated under stochasticity, non-permanent immunity and breakthrough infections which were not considered in Dashtbali and Mirzaie (2021) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giordano et al. (2021)</ref>. The proposed decentralized estimation needs to obtain values of some model parameters based on published external studies due to some state variables are latent. However, some of these parameters may be incorporated into the proposed estimation framework, for instance, the coefficient r among the three infection rates may be estimated by enlarging the model-based simulation. Further studies are needed in this regard. It is also noted that the imputation of various compartments is based on the mean specification of Model (2).</p><p>The Poisson regression in (2) implicitly assumes the means of the daily increments are equal to their variances. If overdispersion exists in the observed data, negative binomial regression with the same mean specification can be used to replace the Poisson assumption in (2). Given the mean µ t , the variance of the negative binomial distribution is equal to µ t + µ 2 t / for an overdispersion parameter . A similar estimation procedure can be carried out to estimate the model parameters by including the additional parameter in the objective functions ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), and simulating the trajectories of the proposed model under the negative binomial distribution.</p><p>Our analyses on the 10 countries' data show significant real-world vaccine benefits in slowing down the COVID-19 infection, largely meeting the WHO standard for 50% VEs even in the Delta dominated periods, despite the VEs waning over time as the Delta variant dominated. Our results on real-world VE were largely agreeable to those of the published studies via clinical trials and retrospective studies with smaller sample size and higher costs. As demonstrated in the scenario analysis in Section 7, the proposal estimation approach can be used to simulate outcomes under various vaccination strategies, for instance doubling the vaccination rates of the first dose for a more intensive version of the first-dose-priority, in an effort to find better strategies than the one having been carried out by the countries. Our finding of higher effectiveness of the full vaccination would support efforts for the boost vaccine uptake in the population in the Omicron era.</p><p>Funding.
