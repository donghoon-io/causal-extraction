Controlling neuronal dynamics via external stimuli provides methods to suppress pathological behavior such as seizures and manipulate brain function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, it is still challenging to constitute a feedback control law for neurons since we cannot directly observe neuronal multi-dimensional state; we can only obtain a part of the entire neuronal activities. For instance, only noisy membrane potentials are observable <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Therefore, it is essential to establish a method for simultaneously estimating and controlling the nonlinear neuronal dynamics from only noisy membrane potentials.</p><p>To control the neurons, it is required to have accurate information about the state and the dynamics of the neurons. Some previous methods have been proposed to estimate the state and the dynamics of the neurons from lower dimensional observation data based on the statistic machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Some previous methods estimate the neuronal dynamics by using offline manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Other previous method estimates the neuronal dynamics by using online manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. On the other hand, some previous method has been proposed to control neurons based on the modern control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> or stochastic optimal control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, these conventional methods for controlling neuronal dynamics assume either the state or the dynamics to be known. This is unrealistic assumption in neuronal systems, since several neuron models, like the Morris-Lecar model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, have unobservable latent variables. Moreover, imaging technique provides only lower dimensional variables compared with high dimensional latent variables. Nonetheless, there is no integrated framework for simultaneously estimating and controlling neuronal dynamics.</p><p>In this study, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo based framework for simultaneously estimating and controlling the nonlinear individual neuronal state and dynamics under a realistic situation where only noisy membrane potentials can be obtained. We focus on a probabilistic framework to estimate and control neuronal dynamics, in particular, the state-space model and the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method as well as model predictive control theory. This paper is organized as follows. We derive the automatic framework to simultaneously estimate and control the single neuron state based on the sequential Monte Carlo method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, the expectation-maximization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and the SMC-based model predictive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in section 2. In the proposed method, we formulate the state-space model based on the Morris-Lecar neuron model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in a partial observation situation. Next, we derive an online algorithm for simultaneously estimating latent variables and parameters by employing the sequential Monte Carlo method and the expectation-maximization algorithm. Then, by combining the model predictive control with the sequential Monte Carlo method, we constitute the automatic feedback control law for the single neuron. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we estimate and control the neuron model under simulation environments in section 3. We show the proposed method can successfully estimate and control the neuron state. The concluding remarks are given in section 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Morris-Lecar neuron model</head><p>Here we formulate a nonlinear state-space model based on the Morris-Lecar neuron model.

Next, we consider the observation model for the state-space model. We assume we can obtain only a one-dimensional time series of noisy membrane potentials {y t } t≥0 . By introducing the additive Gaussian noise with its variance σ 2 y ∈ R, we formulate the observation model of the state-space model as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p(y t | x t ) = N (y t | g(v t ), σ 2 y ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where g(v) is arbitrary function which can be either nonlinear or linear.

By using SMC we estimate the latent variable from partial observation data, and even if the model includes nonlinearity, the latent variable can be successfully estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Here, we consider estimating the latent state x t by using predictive distribution p(x t | Y t-1 ) and the filtering distribution p(x t | Y t ). In the SMC method, both distributions are approximated by using particles, which represent the value of the latent state. The SMC method is divided into two steps: the prediction step and filtering step.</p><p>In the predictive step, we sample the particles with the system model [Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>)] as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">x(i) t ∼ p(x t | x (i) t-1 , I t-1 , θ) for i = 1, . . . , N , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where i is the index of the particle and N is the number of the particles.</p><p>x(i) t represents the predictive particles which approximate the predictive distribution of the latent variable.

(<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Then, each particle is resampled based on the likelihoods. We use the multinomial resampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> given as following procedure for each particle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">a (i) ∼ M ( w(1) t , . . . , w(N) t ) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>x</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(i) t = x(a (i) ) t ,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">w (i) t = 1 N , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">M ( w(1) t , . . . , w(N) t )</formula><p>denotes a multinomial distribution supported on {1, 2, . . . , N }.

The obtained particles {(x</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(i) t , w (i)</formula><p>t )} N i=1 also are used not only to estimate the parameters in section 2.3, but also to constitute the feedback law introduced in section 2.4.</p></div>

The original EM algorithm is an offline algorithm that updates the parameter θ iteratively with the following rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">θ k = arg max θ E [log p(Y 1:T , X 1:T | θ)] p(X 1:T |Y 1:T ,θ k-1 ) , (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>where k is an iteration number, X i:j and Y i:j respectively denote the time series of the latent variable and observations X i:j = {x i , . . . , x j }, Y i:j = {y i , . . . , y j }, and T is a terminal time index.</p><p>In our study, we consider the parameter θ k is updated at times {k × T interval } k=1,2,••• , where k represents the renewal number and T interval denotes the interval of the update time. In addition, the expectation with respect to the previous parameter θ k-1 in Eq.

The procedure is summarized as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">θk = arg max θ E [ log p(Y win(t) , X win(t) | θ) ] p(X win(t) |Y win(t) ,θ k-1 ) , (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">θ k = (1 -η k )θ k-1 + η k θk , (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where X win(t) = X t-L(t):t and η k is a number that satisfy 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">&lt; η k &lt; 1, η k → 0 as k → ∞.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Model predictive control driven by the sequential Monte Carlo method</head><p>To constitute the feedback control law under a practical situation where the state and the parameters are unknown, we combine the SMC method-based model predictive control (SMC-MPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> with our dynamics estimator. The model predictive control (MPC) in a modern control theory is a feedback control law that (1) at time t, formulates an optimal control problem in a future interval called horizon with the given model x t+1 = f (x t , I t ), (2) solves the optimal problem to obtain the optimal control input series {I * τ } τ ∈horizon in the horizon, (3) adopts the first one of the obtained optimal control input series. Here, the optimal problem is attributed to solving the Euler-Lagrange equation which includes the derivative of the model with respect to the state and control input. On the other hand, in the SMC-MPC, the optimal control problem is replaced with a filtering problem based on an extended state-space model.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the overview of the SMC-MPC. In our framework, two distinct SMC modules exist; one (SMC) is a state estimator described in the subsection 2.2 and the other (second SMC) is a solver of the optimal control problem defined below. Once the state particles</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">{ x (i) t , w (i) t } N i=1</formula><p>are obtained via SMC, we sample the control input particles</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">{ Ī(i) t } N i=1 by using the input proposal distribution p ( Īt | I t-1 )</formula><p>. With the extended particles</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">{ x (i) t , Ī(i) t , w (i) t } N i=1</formula><p>and the reference trajectory {r t , r t+1 , . . . , r t+T H }, we solve the control-filtering problem by applying the second SMC in the horizon. Finally, we adopt the actual control input I t obtained from the filtering distribution of the initial control input p( Īt | r t:t+T H ). Here, we discuss the detail of the SMC-MPC. To formulate the control-filtering problem, we define the extended state-space model in the horizon. The extended state-space model consists of the extended system model and the extended observation model as usual. To define the extended system model, we consider the control input I t is regarded as the part of the extended state ζ t = (x t , Īt , Ĩt ), where Ĩt is a dummy input to preserve the initial control input. Note that the notation xt , Īt is required in order to distinguish the prediction transition</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">{( xt , Īt ) , ( xt+1 , Īt+1 ) , . . . , ( xt+T H , Īt+T H )}</formula><p>in the horizon and the actual state time-series {x 1 , . . . , x t } and input time-series {I 1 , . . . , I t }. Hence we formulate the extended system model in the horizon as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">       xτ+1 ∼ p(x τ +1 | xτ , Īτ ; θ), xt = x t Īτ+1 ∼ p( Īτ+1 | ζ τ ), Īt ∼ p(I t | I t-1 ), Ĩτ+1 = Ĩτ , Ĩt = Īt , (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">)</formula><p>where τ ∈ {t, t + 1, . . . , t + T H } is the discrete time in the horizon and T H is a length of the horizon.</p><p>Here, the state transition p(x τ +1 | xτ , Īτ ; θ) in the horizon is defined by using the original system model p(x t+1 | x t , I t ; θ) given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>). In our study, the control input transition p( Īτ+1 | ζ τ ) and the initial distribution for the control input p( Īt | I t-1 ) are designed to ensure that the input time-series { Īt , . . . , Īt+T H } always remain within a certain range as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">Īτ+1 = clip I lim ( Īτ + Īstream τ +1 + z τ ) -Īstream τ +1 , (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_43">) Īt = clip I lim (I t-1 + Īstream t + αz t-1 ) -Īstream t , (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">)</formula><p>where z t-1 ∼ N (0, σ 2 I ), α is a scaling constant, Īstream t is a sum of external currents streaming from other neurons, 0 &lt; I lim is a limit of the total applied currents, and clip is a clamp function defined as clip a (u) = {|u + a| -|u -a|} /2. In our study, the prediction of the external currents Īstream τ is fixed at the value observed at time t, i.e. Īstream τ = I stream t for τ ∈ {t, t + 1, . . . , t + T H }. Note that the transition probability is not explicitly required to be known in the extended state-space model.</p><p>Next, we formulate the extended observation model in the horizon. We consider controlling the state towards the given reference membrane potentials {r τ } t+T H τ =t . In the SMC-MPC, we regard the reference trajectory as a realization of the Markov chain with the extended system model in the horizon. Therefore, we formulate the extended observation model (referred as a setpoint equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">r τ ∼ p(r τ | ζ τ ) = N (r τ | vτ , σ 2 r ),<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where σ 2 r is a variance which adjusts an acceptable error against the reference trajectory. By using SMC in the horizon which we call the second SMC, we can efficiently solve the filtering problem defined by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_40">20</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>  t+T H } N i=1 , we obtain the point estimation of this filtering distribution, e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">I * t = N ∑ i=1 w (i) t+T H Ĩ(i) t+T H . (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">)</formula><p>Finally, we adopt I t = I * t as the actual control input at time t. Here we briefly touch the difference between the conventional MPC and the SMC-MPC. In the SMC-MPC, it is not necessary to derive derivatives of the model. Moreover, we do not estimate the state explicitly but need only the particles. The only requirements of the SMC-MPC itself is that the model can be simulated in forward and this requirements is satisfied in typical cases. On the other hand, the conventional MPC requires derivatives of the Hamiltonian and point-estimation of the state, which leads inflexibility. Nevertheless, the control input obtained by applying the SMC-MPC is equivalent to the value obtained by using the conventional MPC under some assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>We have proposed an automatic control framework, even if the state and the dynamics are unknown. Although the conventional MPC enables us to handle even a nonlinear model, the conventional MPC requires the state and the model to be known. The SMC-MPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> resolves one side of this problem by combining the SMC method with MPC effectively. However, they assumed that the model dynamics to be known. The proposed method constitutes the feedback control law by combining the SMC-MPC with the state and the parameter estimators.</p></div>

The true neuronal dynamics is assumed to be the Morris-Lecar neuron model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Here, we assume multi-dimensional latent variables v and n, and the conductances of ion channels g L , g Ca , g K are unknown. The reference membrane potentials are generated by using the Morris-Lecar model in advance. In practice, the constant current influenced by other neurons exists. We consider that the net input current I for the neuron consists of the constant current I stream and the controllable input I in , i.e. I = I stream + I in . We assume the sum of external currents streaming from other neurons I stream t to be known.

The number of particles N is set to be N = 2000 in subsection 3.2 and N = 1000 in subsection 3.3, respectively. For the state estimation, we simply use weighted mean of the particles as a point estimation at time t i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">x est,t = ∑ N i=1 w (i) t x (i) t .</formula><p>For the online parameter estimation, we set</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">T interval = 100, n iter = 20, η k = 1 √ k+1 , Z 1 = 2</formula><p>3 , Z 2 = 3, τ win = 0.1. For SMC-MPC, the length of the horizon T H and the acceptable error variance σ 2 r is set to be T H = 10, σ 2 r = 0.1 2 , respectively. We set the variance σ 2 I = 1 and the initial scaling constant α = 10 in the input proposal.

We confirm here that our method can estimate and control the neuronal dynamics even if the parameter set is different. In this subsection, we consider the reference time-series v ref includes the transition between complex firing state and resting state. That is, the reference v ref is assumed to be a firing state for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 and 500 ≤ t ≤ 750 while resting state for 250 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 750 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and there are switches between two different states at t = 250, 500 and 750.

Moreover, we can control the neuronal membrane potentials towards the desired firing pattern by using our proposal method. Note that the control input (the upper left graph) always satisfies the norm constraint. The lower left graph of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the true channel variable n true (blue line) and the estimated value n est (orange dashed line). We also find that we can successfully estimate the latent variables, even if the neuron represents the different firing pattern. Next, we clarify whether our method can estimate and control the neuronal dynamics using feedback input current with the norm constraint. The upper left graph of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the applied input current I in (blue line), the streaming current I stream (orange dotted line), and the limit I lim (red dashdotted line).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Robustness against the observation noise</head><p>Here, we discuss the robustness of our proposed framework. In the previous subsections, we verified our proposal framework under the observation noise σ y = 0.1. Although we can obtain relatively precise membrane potentials by using recent imaging technology, it is worth considering the situation where the observation noise is large. We evaluate our proposed framework under different noise levels. Here, the true parameter is set to be the parameter for Hopf bifurcation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows how the tracking error changes as the observation noise σ y becomes larger. Here, the tracking error E tracking is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">E tracking = 1 T T ∑ t=1 {v true (t) -v ref (t)} 2<label>(25)</label></formula><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we consider several noise levels, σ y = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 5, 7.5, and 10. Note both axis in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> are log-scale. The obtained tracking errors for σ y ≤ 5 are very small, i.e., E tracking ≤ 2.0. On the other hand, the error for σ y = 10 almost reaches 10 2 .</p><p>To confirm to what extent the observation noise affects our automatic control strategy, we visualize the membrane potentials in the experiment. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the behavior of the membrane potentials for specific observation noises. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the upper graphs correspond to moderate noise levels (σ y = 1, 5) and the lower graphs strong noise levels (σ y = 7.5, 10). Concretely, the left up graph in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> corresponds to the experiment result when σ y = 1.0, the right up σ y = 5, the left down graph σ y = 7.5, and right down one σ y = 10, respectively. Each graph shows the true membrane potential v true (blue line), the estimated one v est (orange dashed line), and the reference one v ref (green dotted line) that are obtained for the corresponding noise level. We can see our proposed framework controls the spiking time precisely given by reference membrane potentials under noisy environment, i.e. σ y ≤ 7.5. On the other hand, in the right down graph (σ y = 10) in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, our proposed framework make finite errors for 150 ≤ t ≤ 300, whereas the true membrane potentials are traced precisely in the other time period (0 ≤ t ≤ 150, 300 ≤ t ≤ 900) and the dynamical membrane behavior of polarization and hyperpolarization can be traced even for 150 ≤ t ≤ 300. This error for 150 ≤ t ≤ 300 is because extremely high noise disturbs the state and dynamics estimators, which causes the controller to estimate an non-optimal control input.</p><p>With recent advances in imaging technology, we can observe neuronal membrane potentials more precisely <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In other words, the observation noise will become less and less. The experiment shows that our proposed framework can successfully estimate and control the neuronal dynamics when σ y ≤ 7.5. Hence our proposed framework is applicable in realistic situation and sufficiently robust against the observation noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a statistical machine learning based framework for estimating the neuronal state and dynamics, and simultaneously controlling the neuronal dynamics. We have shown that the proposal method not only well estimates the multi-dimensional hidden state and the parameters of the neuron, but also successfully control the membrane potentials towards the desired ones under a partial observation situation.</p><p>It should be noted that our framework can handle the nonlinearity of the model without derivatives for control thanks to SMC-MPC. Hence, our framework is applicable to general parametric statespace models, not limited for the Morris-Lecar neuronal model. While our framework is rather general for various types of state-space models described by parametric model formulation, it is essential to extend our framework into the nonparametric models formulation. In the future work, it would be important to consider the case where the internal fluctuation is non-Gaussian or chaotic noise.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
