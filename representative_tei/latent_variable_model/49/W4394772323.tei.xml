<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examines the effect of work motivation, organizational culture, and soft skills on innovative work behavior. Four hundred fifty lecturers obtained the research sample using a purposive sampling technique at six state universities in Indonesia as research respondents. Quantitative data were collected through google Forms and analyzed using the PLS-SEM method to evaluate the measurement and structural models of the latent research variables. The validity (convergent and discriminant) and reliability tests have met the measurement criteria. The variability of the innovative work behavior construct can be explained substantially at 63.4% by the three latent variables. The hypothesis test states that work motivation, organizational culture, and soft skills competence positively and significantly affect innovative work behavior. This study concludes that organizational culture acts as a catalyst for creating soft skills among university lecturers. So higher education management needs to build maximum involvement of all lecturers to continue to improve their soft skills.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The industrial revolution requires the quality of human resources that are more capable, agile, adaptive, and responsive to rapid changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie &amp; Huffman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cetrulo &amp; Nuvolari, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Xu, 2020)</ref>. The world of education is facing rapid economic, social, political, and technological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie &amp; Huffman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Black &amp; Warhurst, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mahfud et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, higher education institutions must be flexible to adapt to changing situations and contexts. Higher education and other educational institutions need an environment that continues to grow positively and is conducive to global human resource competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bøe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rogers et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, it is undeniable that universities need a synergy between lecturers and a work environment that can continuously improve innovation and performance. Innovative behavior is closely related to innovation. Innovation and innovative behavior constitute social change. The difference is only in the emphasis on the characteristics of the change <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bagheri et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nurtanto et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tsamantouridis et al., 2022)</ref>. Innovation emphasizes the characteristics of something observed as something new for individuals or society. The creative attitude emphasizes innovative behavior so that there is a process of changing attitudes from traditional to modern, or attitudes that have not been advanced to already advanced attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ryu, 2022)</ref>. Someone who has innovative behavior is a person who always thinks critically in his daily attitude and works hard so that there is always a change in his environment that is towards a change from traditional to modern or from an attitude that has not progressed to an attitude that is already advanced and strives for the change to be useful or some added value <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hosseini, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ryu, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tsameti et al., 2021)</ref>. People who behave innovatively will always try to make problem-solving efforts in different ways than usual but more effectively and efficiently. Innovative work behavior requires management commitment, involvement, and leadership in developing technical and non-technical supporting factors that can encourage innovative behavior in every job role so that it can be carried out in a structured and systematic manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bagheri et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hosseini, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Menter, 2022)</ref>. Technical factors in innovative work behavior are related to work motivation, organizational culture, and supporting infrastructure to develop workers' technical competence in carrying out work innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tsamantouridis et al., 2022)</ref>. Meanwhile, non-technical factors are related to developing workers' soft skills, which are formed based on the learning process within the social environment of the organization. Organizational culture is an important instrument in improving innovative performance behavior. Educational institutions will progress if they are supported by a strong organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jirek, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mierzwa &amp; Mierzwa, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Perry &amp; Mee, 2022)</ref>. The influence of organizational culture is positive, while others are negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Köse &amp; Korkmaz, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lewitt et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mzangwa, 2019)</ref>. Organizational culture needs to be implemented and improved so that the organization, in the long term, can provide high performance, including making the best organization, and work values that consider everyone as an individual that must be understood and respected <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nurjanah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Perry &amp; Mee, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Xie &amp; Zhang, 2022)</ref>. Work values that lead to good quality and service <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hildesheim &amp; Sonntag, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jirek, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mzangwa, 2019)</ref>. Work values that most employees must be innovators <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gaus et al., 2019)</ref>, and tolerate failure due to innovation efforts and work values that consider informality important to improve communication. Motivation is one of the most important subjects for lecturers as role models for educators who are valued and imitated by their students. Because with motivation apart from being an example for students, motivation can increase the productivity of lecturers at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hosseini &amp; Haghighi Shirazi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xie, 2022)</ref>. There are three aspects of motivation that can be identified. First, motivation describes an energy force that moves someone or causes them to behave in certain activities <ref type="bibr">(Bal et</ref>  The motivational power of lecturers as teaching staff is strongly influenced by the impulses generated from within themselves and their environment, one of which is the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kholifah et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pantzos et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vuong, 2022)</ref>. In contrast, the other aspect is the factor of maintaining the culture and values contained in the institution that can encourage high performance (work achievement). Job satisfaction is related to matching one's expectations and the rewards provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nurjanah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rogers et al., 2021)</ref>. Lecturer job satisfaction impacts work performance, discipline, and quality of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al Idrus et al., 2018)</ref>. Lecturers who are satisfied with their work will likely positively impact education quality. Vice versa, if lecturers' job satisfaction is low, it will hurt the development of the quality of education. Likewise, higher education institutions in Indonesia, such as Jakarta State University, Yogyakarta State University, Sebelas Maret University, Semarang State University, Surabaya State University, and Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University always apply organizational culture to maintain company unity to improve performance for the better. However, based on preliminary research, there are several problems with the innovative performance behavior of lecturers. Some lecturers still have not provided new ideas for the maximum progress of an institution. Then, some lecturers do not fully follow the organizational culture. Then the low commitment and work motivation of some lecturers results in a lack of responsibility at work and low job satisfaction felt by lecturers because of co-workers who have different perceptions and opinions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respondent</head><p>The sampling method used in this research is non-probability sampling using a purposive sampling technique. The analytical tool, namely the Structural Equation Model Partial Least Square (SEM PLS), has a recommended minimum sample size of 100 samples (Al-Fraihat et al., 2020; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hair et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hair et al., , 2020))</ref>. The research sample consisted of 450 lecturers at six universities, namely Jakarta State University, Yogyakarta State University, Sebelas Maret University, Semarang State University, Surabaya State University, and Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University. The determination of the sample is based on certain criteria, where the respondents are lecturers who are permanent employees at state universities in Indonesia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Instruments</head><p>The data used in this study is primary data. Primary quantitative data were obtained by distributing questionnaires directly to 450 lecturers at six universities in Indonesia online which were distributed through the Google Form application. In the questionnaire, the Likert scale is based on the respondent's level of agreement on each indicator with a Likert scale value ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The variables and indicators of the research instrument are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methods</head><p>Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a structural equation model, which is a simultaneous equation that focuses on predictions that can describe latent variables (not directly measured) and are measured indirectly based on indicators (manifest variables). The data obtained will be analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM-PLS was chosen because the research objective is predictive. SEM-PLS is appropriate if the main purpose of implementing structural modeling is to predict and explain the target construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hair et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., , 2021</ref>). This study analyzes the effect of work motivation, organizational culture, and soft skills competence on innovative work behavior. The analytical method used is Structural Equation Modeling Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). This research was shown to lecturers at several universities in Indonesia. The results of the analysis of the SEM-PLS compiled recommendations to be shown to lecturers as lecturers in universities. The model's design below describes the independent variables, dependent variables, and indicators used in the study, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyzing of Data</head><p>Evaluation of the measurement model (outer model) will test the validity and reliability of the data on each latent variable using the SmartPLS software. In assessing the measurement model (outer model, convergent and discriminant validity were evaluated. The next stage is reliability testing to prove the instrument's accuracy, consistency, and accuracy in measuring constructs. The reliability and validity of the rule-of-thumb measurement models are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Work motivation, organizational culture, soft skill competence, and innovative work behavior are some of the latent variables in this study. PLS-SEM analysis was used to determine the relationship between latent variables and construct indicators. PLS-SEM is appropriate if the main purpose of implementing structural modeling is to predict and explain the target construct. The testing phase consists of the outer model and the inner model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Measurement Model (Outer Model)</head><p>The initial stage of testing the outer model is measuring convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity consists of outer loading (factor loading &gt;0.70) and AVE (≥0.50). Meanwhile, discriminant validity consists of Fornell-Larcker (each construct has a greater correlation with other constructs) and Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio (HTMT 0.90). The next measurement is to test the model's reliability to prove the instrument's accuracy, consistency, and accuracy in measuring variables. The reliability test measured the CA, Rho_A, and composite reliability (CR) values. The evaluation of the measurement model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Based on the table above, the loading factor value on the indicator is already above 0.70. The analysis of the loading factor test shows that the loading score on each indicator that builds the variable has a higher value constructed by itself compared to the construct indicator value of the other variables. This explains that the cross-loading test has met the criteria for discriminant validity. The average extracted variance (AVE) value for each indicator is above 0.50. As for the value of CA, Rho_A and composite reliability (CR) on each indicator have a value of more than 0.70. It is known that this model has met the standard values in the outer model criteria. Furthermore, discriminant validity was evaluated by looking at the Fornell larcker value (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>) and the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>). The HTMT is a recommended alternative method to assess discriminant validity. This method uses a multitraitmultimethod matrix as the basis for measurement. The HTMT value must be less than 0.90. Based on the analysis results, the entire value of the HTMT matrix &lt;0.90. Then the HTMT test ensures that the discriminant validity between the two reflective constructs is met.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of the Structural Model (Inner Model)</head><p>The initial stage of structural model analysis is by looking at the value of VIF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>), R-square, Q-square predictive relevance, path coefficient (hypothesis testing), and goodness of fit (GoF). R-square describes the amount of variance of the construct described by the model. Q-square predictive relevance measures how well the structural model generates the observed values. The goodness of fit is used to evaluate measurement and structural models, aiming to provide a simple measure of overall model prediction and parameter estimation. T-test to test the significance of the relationships between the constructs used as the basis for testing the hypothesis. The results of the coefficient of determination test (R2) are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. The Q-square (Q 2 ) predictive relevance test aims to validate the model's predictive ability. The calculation results obtained a value of 0.374, which explains that the model of the analysis results can explain 37.40% of the phenomena studied. While the remaining 62.60% is an error from the model explained by other variables not observed in this study, the calculations can be seen in Appendix 3. However, with a Q2 value &gt; 0.350, this explains that the exogenous latent variable as the explanatory variable can predict the endogenous latent variable.</p><p>The final evaluation stage of the inner model is to calculate the overall fit index value using the goodness of fit formula (GoF index). Based on the results of the GoF calculation, a value of 0.621 is obtained, which means it is more significant than 0.26. Furthermore, the fit model obtained is SRMR = 0.071 (&lt;0.80), NFI 0.779 (&gt;50%), and rms Theta 0.149. This explains that the GoF and model fit in this study are included in the large category, meaning that the model's fit is high.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref> and<ref type="table">9</ref>. </p><note type="other">Hypothesis Testing</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Hypothesis H1, which states that work motivation has a positive and significant effect on innovative work behavior, is accepted. This means that the higher the work motivation, the higher the innovative work behavior. Maintaining performance is meant by the extent to which employees are encouraged to act aggressively, innovatively, and take risks. Furthermore, the last indicator is the pattern of communication to determine the extent to which organizational communication is limited by the formal hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ferine et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nurjanah et al., 2020)</ref>. Hypothesis H3, which states that soft skills have a positive and significant effect on innovative work behavior is accepted. This means that the higher the soft skills, the higher the innovative work behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Menter, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ryu, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tsameti et al., 2021)</ref>. Because to get good work results, the company needs to make provisions in the employee recruitment process, one of which is soft skills. The explanation that can be given from the results of this analysis is that lecturers who have soft skills (they believe that the output is based on their actions) will show better work performance than employees who do not have soft skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Asonitou, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nurtanto et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tadjer et al., 2020)</ref>. In a situation that allows greater ability in individuals, the level of employee work ability depends on the match between the soft skill structure and will have better abilities. Research Araújo &amp; Pestana (2017) defines an employee with high soft skills. His workability will tend to be good (because the direction of the correlation is Positive), supported by hard skills with long work experience. Furthermore, the results of this study are also in line with research conducted by Asonitou (2022) with a title that supports this research. The results of the partial study (t-test) show that the hard skills and soft skills variables directly affect employee performance. Hypothesis H4, which states that work motivation has a positive and significant effect on organizational culture, is accepted. It can be concluded that the higher the work motivation, the higher the organizational culture will be. Hypothesis H5, which states that soft skills have a positive and significant effect on organizational culture, is accepted. It can be concluded that the higher the soft skills, the higher the organizational culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The function of adding the role of soft skills as a predictor of innovative work behavior, universities need to provide autonomy and breadth to share knowledge with lecturers. Therefore, universities need to create organizational culture as a positive environment that spurs individual competence and engagement of lecturers in higher education institutions. Researchers continue to study knowledge as an important school resource. It can be said that skills, soft skills can significantly improve school performance. Organizational culture transforms individual knowledge into university knowledge. This study concludes that organizational culture is a catalyst for the knowledge-creation process among university lecturers. Because lecturers are supposed to prepare their students to study and work. Based on the conclusions of this study, the management of higher education institutions needs to build maximum involvement of all lecturers to improve their soft skills continuously. Lecturer training in each part of the university is necessary with a level of intensity, content, and context that is adjusted to the key performance indicators of each lecturer.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

Second, this movement directly aims at motivation with a strong goal orientation. Third, help maintain morale always (Saether, 2019; Vuong, 2022). Therefore, lecturers who have high motivation will also increase innovative work behavior. Research Nurjanah et al. (2020) explains that school organizational culture, leadership behavior, pedagogic competence, work motivation, and performance together directly or indirectly through work motivation and performance have a positive and significant effect on teacher job satisfaction. Research Gaus et al. (2019); Lewitt et al. (2019) concluded that between the leadership style variables on the job satisfaction variable and moderated work motivation is that all the regression coefficients produced are positive, meaning that the leadership style variables, work motivation, and moderating variables. Which are the result the interaction of leadership style and work motivation has a positive and positive effect on job satisfaction (Al Idrus et al., 2018; Ferine et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2021).</figDesc><table /></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This study describes indicators of work motivation that affect innovative work behavior, including basic, security, safety, social, appreciation, and self-actualization needs. This study supports the research results<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pantzos et al., 2022)</ref>, which state that fulfilling needs is the basis for work behavior. Work motivation will arise if the needs are met, as stated by Hosseini &amp; Haghighi Shirazi (2021); Saether (2019) regarding the hierarchy of individual needs, namely physiological needs. Physiological needs in general, namely the need to eat, drink, house, and sexual. This need is the most basic for humans. Furthermore, the lecturer's need must be met in working is a decent salary/wages. This study's results align with the results of research Hosseini &amp; Haghighi Shirazi (2021), which state that salary is one of the things that increase work motivation toward innovative work behavior. On the other hand, research Xie (2022) mentions improving the performance of lecturers or employees through motivation, namely the need for security, as supported by the results of this study. These needs are the need for protection from hazards and the work environment. In working, employees need health benefits, insurance, and pension funds. In addition, research<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Saether (2019)</ref>, supports this research on social needs in improving employee performance. Social needs are the needs that are accepted in the group and love each other.Research  Bal et al. (2022); Pantzos et al. (2022), explains that in this relationship, employees want to be accepted at work and have good and harmonious work interactions. Furthermore, indicators of the need for self-esteem are also needed to support work motivation. Research Kim et al. (2021) is in line with this research, namely the need for self-esteem, namely the need to be respected and appreciated by others. Employees need appreciation and recognition in this relationship and are not treated arbitrarily. The last indicator is the need for selfactualization to develop oneself and the potential recommended by research<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vuong (2022)</ref>. In this relationship, employees need opportunities to grow and develop personally. Hypothesis H2, which states that organizational culture has a positive and significant effect on innovative work behavior, is accepted. This means that the higher the organizational culture, the higher the innovative work behavior. This study reveals three important characteristics of organizational culture: organizational culture is passed on to new employees through socialization. Both organizational cultures influence individual behavior at work. Third, organizational culture operates at two different levels<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hosseini, 2020)</ref>. Research Jirek (2020);<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lewitt et al. (2019)</ref> regarding decision-making on organizational culture supports this research. Furthermore, alignment indicators to measure the extent to which lecturers identify themselves as a whole with their organization rather than with certain work groups or other areas of professional expertise are expressed in the indicators of this research. The research results on these indicators can be compared with ours. Furthermore, results-oriented and goal-oriented aims to measure the extent to which management focuses on results rather than on the techniques and processes used to achieve these results. Research</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nurjanah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Perry &amp; Mee, 2022)</ref> </p>recommends being oriented to the interests of employees to know the extent to which work activities are organized around teams, the size of which is individual satisfaction. The indicators of maintaining performance, namely the level of responsibility, freedom, and independence of the individual, are revealed by research Jirek (2020); Mierzwa &amp; Mierzwa (2020), which supports this research. In addition, tolerance for conflict is necessary for assessing work culture on innovative performance behavior.</p></note></figure>
