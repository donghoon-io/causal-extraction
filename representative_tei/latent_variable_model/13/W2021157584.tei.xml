<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTRACT. Objective:</head><p>The aim of this study was to describe older adults' 20-year alcohol-consumption and drinking-problem trajectories, identify baseline predictors of them, and determine whether older men and women differ on late-life drinking trajectory characteristics and predictors. Method: Two-group simultaneous latent growth modeling was used to describe the characteristics and baseline predictors of older community-residing men's (n = 399) and women's (n = 320) 20-year drinking trajectories. Chi-square difference tests of increment in fi t of latent growth models with and without gender invariance constraints were used to determine gender differences in drinking trajectory characteristics and predictors. Results: Unconditional quadratic growth models best described older individuals' within-individual, 20-year drinking trajectories, with alcohol consumption following an average pattern of delayed decline, and drinking problems an average pattern of decline followed by leveling off. On average, older men declined in alcohol consumption somewhat later than did older women. The best baseline predictors of more rapid decline in alcohol consumption and drinking problems were drinking variables indicative of heavier, more problematic alcohol use at late middle age. Conclusions: The course of alcohol consumption and drinking problems from late middle age onward is one of net decline, but this decline is neither swift nor invariable. Gender differences in the timing of decline in drinking suggest that ongoing monitoring of alcohol consumption may be especially important for older men. Further research is needed to identify factors known at late middle age that prospectively explain long-term change in late-life use of alcohol. <ref type="bibr">(J. Stud Alcohol Drugs, 72, 308-321, 2011)</ref> implied that alcohol consumption and drinking problems invariably decline over the course of later life and, therefore, need not be considered key factors involved in late-life health and social functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahlstrom, 2008)</ref>. However, there is scarce evidence to support this view, and it has been drawn from studies with important design and analytic limitations. Furthermore, there has been almost no research to identify predictors of late-life decline in alcohol consumption and drinking problems. From a public health perspective, it is important to identify factors known at late middle age that prospectively infl uence older adults' subsequent drinking trajectories; this might inform development of interventions aimed at promoting healthier late-life drinking practices.</p><p>This study builds on others' and our previous work in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brennan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moos et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moos et al., , 2010) )</ref> by using latent growth modeling to describe the 20-year drinking trajectories of men and women as they mature from late middle age (about age 55-65) through "later" old age (about age <ref type="bibr">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr">[85]</ref>. In addition, it extends earlier research by determining whether key demographic, health-related, coping, and social context characteristics known at late middle age predict the level and shape of older individuals' subsequent 20-year drinking trajectories. Because so little is known about older women's drinking behavior as distinct from that of older men, this study also addresses whether gender modifi es the characteristics and predictors of 20-year late-life drinking trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in alcohol consumption and drinking problems with age</head><p>Many cross-sectional studies, encompassing broad age ranges, have shown an association between older age and lower alcohol consumption and levels of drinking problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barnes, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Breslow and Smothers, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dawson et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eigenbrodt et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Johnson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Knupfer and Room, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Livingston and Room, 2009)</ref>. Longitudinal studies also have generally shown that older age predicts lower alcohol consumption as well as faster decline in alcohol use and drinking problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Glynn et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Karlamangla et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Levenson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moore et al., 2005</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kerr et al., 2004)</ref>. Most longitudinal studies confi ned to older (i.e., age ≥ 50) samples also have identifi ed a decline over time in participants' alcohol use and drinking problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fillmore et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Platt et al., 2010)</ref>. However, some have shown stability or, less frequently, an increase in older adults' alcohol consumption and problematic alcohol use <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Glynn et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gordon and Kannel, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stall, 1986a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Temple and Leino, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Although these studies have made signifi cant contributions toward better understanding late-life drinking behavior, they have design and analytic limitations that can be improved upon. First, most of these studies focus exclusively on the drinking patterns of older men. Second, most draw conclusions about late-life drinking patterns from data obtained at only two measurement points. Third, almost all of them focus on group-level, average change between measurement points in alcohol consumption and drinking problems. In this regard, our own research shows that there is group-level, moderate decline in alcohol consumption and drinking problems over 10-and 20-year intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Moos et al., 2004a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Moos et al., , 2004b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Moos et al., , 2009) )</ref> but that, early in the course of old age (from about age 60 to about age 70), within-individual alcohol consumption shows modest rates of decline and that there is signifi cant variability in this pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brennan et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictors of late-life drinking trajectories</head><p>Predictors of late-life drinking trajectories may include distal historical and social infl uences, as well as more proximal biological, psychological, and social effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Douglass et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stall, 1987)</ref>. Macro-historical contexts (e.g., Prohibition) and social demographic characteristics may place formative stamps on late-life drinking trajectories. Large longitudinal surveys encompassing a broad adult age range and comprising multiple age cohorts are required to disentangle historical period, cohort, and aging-related effects on adult drinking trajectories. These have yielded relatively consistent evidence for historical period effects-but equivocal fi ndings about age and cohort effects-on adult drinking trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Karlamangla et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kerr et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moore et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>With respect to social demographic characteristics, older age, lower income, and being female, unmarried, and non-White are generally associated with lower levels of alcohol consumption. Men and unmarried individuals experience steeper declines in alcohol consumption over time than do women and married individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Moore et al., 2005</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johnstone et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Karlamangla et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Few studies have examined biological, psychological, and social factors proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Douglass et al. (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stall (1987)</ref> to infl uence late-life drinking trajectories. With regard to biological infl uences, older men identify health problems as a key reason that they cut down on or quit drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stall, 1986b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Walton et al., 2000)</ref>. Consistent with this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Glass et al. (1995)</ref> showed that signifi cant negative health events predicted decline in older adults' alcohol consumption over a 3-year interval. Other longitudinal studies have shown that individuals who engage in potentially risky health behaviors, such as heavier drinking and smoking, subsequently decrease their alcohol consumption more quickly than do lighter drinkers and nonsmokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kerr et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moore et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to psychological factors, coping strategies may help explain late-life drinking trajectories. Use of substances to reduce tension, including "drinking to cope," is associated with slower decline in alcohol consumption during early adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Trim et al., 2008)</ref>. Heavier reliance on avoidance coping predicts poorer drinking outcomes, and this effect may be stronger for men than for women <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brennan and Moos, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cooper et al., 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cooper et al., , 1992;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Timko et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Proximal social infl uences may also affect the course of late-life drinking. Because frequent socializing affords more drinking opportunities, socially engaged individuals may maintain higher levels of alcohol consumption and drinking problems than do less socially engaged individuals. Friends' attitudes about and use of alcohol infl uence younger adults' drinking patterns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Poelen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Trim et al., 2008)</ref> and may continue to do so well into later life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alexander and Duff, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Douglass et al.'s (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stall's (1987)</ref> suppositions, we showed in previous research an association between overall health burden and lower alcohol consumption, and fewer drinking problems, at 10-and 20-year follow-ups <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Moos et al., 2009)</ref>. We showed also that baseline drinking beyond recommended guidelines, smoking, and heavier reliance on avoidance coping foreshadow within-individual decline in alcohol consumption during "early" late life (i.e., from about age 60 to about age 70; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brennan et al., 2010)</ref>. Here, we consider whether these baseline characteristics also have signifi cant effects on 20-year drinking trajectories of individuals aging into very late life (i.e., age 75-85).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Data for this study were drawn from a longitudinal investigation of late-life drinking behavior among community residents ages 55-65 at initial assessment. Participants in this research provided informed consent. The project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University.</p><p>The overall baseline sample (n = 1,884) excluded lifelong nondrinkers and was comparable to community samples of similar age with regard to health characteristics. Participants were followed 1, 4, 10, and 20 years after baseline, with follow-up rates of 94%, 94%, 93%, and 86%, respectively. (For further details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brennan and Moos, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Moos et al., 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moos et al., , 2009.) .)</ref> This study focuses on the surviving 719 participants who completed the 20-year follow-up. This sample comprised 55.5% (n = 399) men and 44.5% (n = 320) women. Baseline mean age in the sample was 60.8 (SD = 3.20). At baseline, 74% of participants were married, 93% were White, and average family income was about $44,000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortality and attrition resulting from nonparticipation</head><p>Between baseline assessment and the 20-year follow-up, 1,045 individuals were unable to participate in the study because of death (n = 969) or incapacitating illness (n = 76). Death and incapacitating illness were reported by family members or care providers. Almost all (90%) mortality cases were confi rmed by death certifi cate, the remainder by another offi cial source (e.g., the Social Security Death Index).</p><p>At baseline, nonsurviving participants were less likely than surviving participants to be female (30% vs. 45%), married (66% vs. 74%), and White (89% vs. 93%); they also had lower annual family income ($32,000 vs. $44,000). There was no difference between nonsurvivors and survivors on baseline amount of alcohol consumed, but nonsurvivors had slightly more (1.8 vs. 1.1) drinking problems.</p><p>Between baseline and the 20-year follow-up, 120 individuals survived but declined to participate further in the study or could not be located for follow-up. At baseline, these surviving nonparticipants were more likely than surviving participants to be female (54% vs. 45%) but were less likely to be married (64% vs. 74%) and White (86% vs. 93%) and had lower annual family income ($35,000 vs. $44,000). The surviving nonparticipants consumed slightly less alcohol (0.97 vs. 1.1 drinks per day) than did surviving participants, but there was no difference between these groups in baseline drinking problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Drinking behavior ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION: Alcohol consumption was calculated with items from the Health and Daily Living form <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Moos et al., 1992)</ref>, which assess typical frequency and quantity of consumption of wine, beer, and hard liquor in the past month. Separately for each beverage type, we multiplied participants' weekly frequency of consuming that beverage type (ranging from "less than once a week" to "every day") by the quantity (number of drinks) of that beverage when it was consumed. We obtained the sum of these three frequency-by-quantity products and divided it by 7, to calculate the total number of drinks per day consumed by participants.</p><p>DRINKING PROBLEMS: Number of drinking problems was assessed with the Drinking Problem Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Finney et al., 1991)</ref>, a 17-item survey tapping negative physical, psychological, and social consequences of alcohol consumption. The Drinking Problem Index has high internal consistency and good construct validity, sensitivity, and specifi city <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bamberger et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brennan and Moos, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Finney et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kopera-Frye et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Baseline predictors of drinking trajectories. In addition to demographic data, these included health problems, a count of the number of 13 medical conditions (e.g., cancer, diabe-tes) and 13 serious physical ailments (e.g., trouble breathing, back pain) that began more than 1 year ago, assessed with items from the Life Stressors and Resources Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Moos, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Moos and Moos, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Health risk behaviors were assessed with Health and Daily Living items and included smoker (0 = no; 1 = yes) and drinking beyond recommended alcohol-consumption guidelines (&gt;2 drinks per day; 0 = no; 1 = yes). The &gt;2 cutpoint was based on alcohol-consumption guidelines of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref>), as well as the National Institute on Alcohol <ref type="bibr">Abuse and Alcoholism (1995)</ref>.</p><p>Individuals who endorsed smoking, alcohol consumption, or tranquilizer use as a way of reducing tension were classifi ed as using substances for tension reduction (0 = no; 1 = yes). The Coping Responses Inventory (CRI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moos, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">2004)</ref> was used to assess participants' avoidance and approach coping. To calculate percentage use of avoidance coping, we summed participants' scores on the CRI avoidance coping subscales, then divided them by summed responses to the CRI avoidance and CRI approach coping subscales.</p><p>Two Drinking Problem Index items assessed friends' and family members' negative reactions to participants' drinking during the past year.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of analyses</head><p>We used Mplus statistical software (Version 5.12; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Muthén and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muthén, 1998-2007)</ref> to analyze the data. First, to summarize overall group-level change in alcohol consumption and drinking problems, we calculated means, standard deviations, and cross-wave correlations among these drinking variables separately for men and women.</p><p>Next, we conducted two-group simultaneous latent growth modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Muthén and Khoo, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Muthén and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muthén 1998-2007)</ref> to describe participants' 20-year drinking trajectories, identify effects of key baseline variables on trajectory growth characteristics, and determine differences between men and women on the trajectory characteristics and their predictors. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> summarizes the latent growth model examined in this study. Participants' drinking trajectories comprised measured information about their drinking behavior at fi ve assessment points (DB0-DB20). This information was linked to latent growth parameters I, S, and Q using the time metric of years since baseline assessment (0, 1, 4, 10, and 20 years), controlling for baseline chronological age. Latent growth characteristic I represents "intercept," the estimated average initial level of drinking behavior; S represents "slope," its estimated average linear growth rate; and Q represents "quadratic," the estimated quadratic growth rate, interpretable as acceleration or deceleration of growth, in drinking behavior. Variance in each of the I, S, and Q growth parameters is also important but, for simplicity, not shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Measured variable X represents baseline variables hypothesized to infl uence the level and shape of participants' 20-year drinking trajectories.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Muthén and Khoo (1998)</ref>, we fi rst simultaneously modeled men's and women's unconditional mean, linear, and quadratic growth models to determine which of these had best overall fi t to participants' longitudinal alcohol-consumption and drinking-problem data.

Baseline chronological age was statistically controlled in each predictive model. To determine whether gender had statistically signifi cant moderating effects on trajectory growth characteristics and on effects of their predictors, we conducted chi-square difference tests to ascertain increment in fi t of latent growth models with and without gender invariance constraints placed on parameter estimates in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Muthén and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muthén, 1998-2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Preacher et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>

Complete abstinence from alcohol was not characteristic of these men and women, at any assessment point. For example, at baseline, only about 14% of the men and 9% of the women had abstained from consuming alcohol in the last month; 20 years later, this was the case for about 22% of the men and 23% of the women. Thus, the means on drinks per day shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1a</ref> indicate that, on average, participants drank lightly at baseline and continued to do so over each of the four subsequent assessments.</p><p>Compared with women, men drank somewhat more and showed more variability in number of drinks per day at each assessment point. Over the four assessment points covering baseline to 10 years, men reduced, then very slightly increased their average drinks per day, but, by the 20-year assessment, had declined markedly in alcohol consumption. On average, women continued to drink lightly across the four initial assessments covering baseline to 10 years, and were drinking signifi cantly less than one drink per day by the 20-year assessment. Men consistently experienced more drinking problems, and more variance in levels of drinking problems, than did women.

Drinking problems were also fairly stable for both women (rs range from .42 to .74) and men (rs range from .24 to .79).</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows unconditional 20-year growth models, simultaneously fi t on men's and women's alcohol consumption. As indicated by fi t indices, an unconditional linear growth model described the data better than did an unconditional mean model (i.e., CFI and SRMR for the unconditional linear model were .94 and .07, compared with .86 and .10 for the unconditional mean model). However, an unconditional quadratic growth model fi t the data better still, with a CFI of .99 and SRMR of .03. A chi-square difference test confi rmed that the improved fi t of   the quadratic over the linear growth model was statistically signifi cant. Consistent with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the estimated quadratic growth model in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that men and women were drinking lightly at baseline, about 1.43 drinks for men and 1.07 for women, but that there was variability around this average level of drinking (1.85 for men, 1.20 for women). On average, both men and women remained relatively stable or slightly increased their alcohol consumption over the fi rst several years of the study, as indicated by the linear growth rate of 0.67 for men and 0.19 for women. However, among men there was an accelerated decline in alcohol consumption from the 10-to the 20-year follow-up (quadratic growth term = -0.42). A less pronounced accelerated decline from the 10-to 20-year assessments (quadratic growth term = -0.18) was characteristic of women's alcohol consumption.</p><p>Chi-square difference tests showed statistically signifi cant differences between men and women on initial level of alcohol consumption, χ 2 Δ(1) = 11.7, p &lt; .01; linear growth rate, χ 2 Δ(1) = 7.8, p &lt; .01; and quadratic growth rate, χ 2 Δ(1) = 9.8, p &lt; .01. This confi rmed the gender differences implied in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, wherein, compared with men, women initially and consistently consumed less alcohol, were less likely to slow in linear rate of decline, and had a slower acceleration of alcohol-consumption reduction from the 10-to the 20year assessment.</p><p>Drinking problems. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> also shows unconditional growth models of drinking problems, simultaneously fi t for men and women. The unconditional mean model provided poor fi t to the data (i.e., CFI = .66; SRMR = .30); this was improved on by an unconditional linear growth model (CFI = .95; SRMR = .06), but improved most by an unconditional quadratic growth model, in which CFI = .97 and SRMR = .04. The increment in improved fi t of the quadratic over the linear growth model was statistically signifi cant, as indicated by chi-square difference test.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, on average, men and women had few drinking problems at baseline (initial status means of 1.35 for men and 0.70 for women), but there was considerable variance in initial levels of drinking problems (variance of initial status was 4.96 for men and 2.24 for women). Both men and women experienced a signifi cant decline over time in drinking problems (linear growth rate = -0.64 for men; -0.61 for women), then showed decelerated decline (quadratic growth rate = 0.12 for men; 0.20 for women) from the 10-year to the 20-year assessments. Chi-square difference tests indicated statistically signifi cant differences between men and women on the initial status growth factor, χ 2 Δ(1) = 18.4, p &lt; .01, and its variance, χ 2 Δ(1) = 38.5, p &lt; .01. </p></div>

The overall fi t of the multivariate predictive model of 20-year alcohol consumption was good, with a CFI of .95, RMSEA of .10, and SRMR of .03 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Several baseline variables independently predicted the level and shape of participants' 20-year alcohol-consumption trajectories. At baseline, men with more health problems tended to drink somewhat less than did men with fewer health problems.

Friends' approval of drinking was associated with more drinking problems at baseline for both men and women and, for women, a faster rate of decline in drinking problems. However, effects of friends' approval of drinking did not signifi cantly differ for men and women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Older men's and older women's late-life drinking trajectories</head><p>Group-level descriptive statistics and within-individual latent growth modeling showed that, over a 20-year interval, there was overall net decline in level of alcohol consumption and number of drinking problems in this community sample of older adults. This is consistent with earlier cross-sectional studies and longitudinal group-level analyses of older adults' drinking patterns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fillmore et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moos et al., 2004a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Moos et al., , 2004b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moos et al., , 2009))</ref>. However, the growth characteristics and variability of these individuals' 20-year drinking trajectories also show that as individuals in this sample progressed from earlier to later old age, decline in alcohol consumption and drinking problems was neither swift nor invariable.</p><p>Best-fi tting latent growth models of this sample's 20-year alcohol consumption showed an overall pattern of delayed decline. That is, the linear growth parameters indicated that during the "earlier" part of late life (i.e., from about age 60 to about age 70) many individuals maintained relatively stable levels of alcohol consumption, and some even slightly increased their drinking, counter to the group-level net trend toward less alcohol consumption by the 20-year follow-up. The signifi cant negative quadratic growth parameters of these models suggest that decline in alcohol consumption was most pronounced during the "later" part of late life (i.e., from about age 70 onward). However, there was signifi cant variability, especially for women, in the latent growth factor means, highlighting the fact that that these 20-year alcohol- Signifi cant gender differences in initial status growth parameters were consistent with the well-documented lifespan pattern of men generally drinking more-and more often-than women do. However, the average within-person trajectories of alcohol consumption differed for men and women. Specifi cally, men's decline in alcohol consumption appeared to occur somewhat later, but then to decline more rapidly, than did women's reduced alcohol consumption. However, the variability in mean growth factors cautions against concluding that this difference refl ects consistent differences between men's and women's drinking patterns. Future studies should consider whether older women as a group consistently differ from older men in timing and rate of decline in late-life alcohol consumption.</p><p>The shape of 20-year drinking-problem trajectories differed from that of 20-year alcohol-consumption trajectories. Both men and women showed decline in drinking problems, especially during the fi rst 10 years of the study, followed by a pattern of leveling-off between 10 and 20 years. Apart from that for initial status, there were no statistically significant gender differences in drinking-problem growth parameters. Thus, although men consistently had higher levels of drinking problems over the course of 20 years, the average shape of their 20-year drinking-problem trajectories did not differ from that of women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline predictors of late-life alcohol-consumption trajectories</head><p>Having fewer health problems, drinking beyond recommended guidelines, using substances to reduce tension, having friends who approved more of drinking, and more drinking-related complaints of family and friends at baseline were all independently associated with higher initial levels of alcohol consumption, but only two of these baseline predictors were independent harbingers of subsequent withinindividual linear change in alcohol consumption. Drinking beyond guidelines and negative reactions to drinking by friends and family predicted an overall faster rate of decline in alcohol use. Drinking beyond guidelines at baseline also reduced the likelihood that this decline in alcohol consumption was accelerated downward during the later part of the 20-year follow-up. Overall, baseline use of alcohol itselfspecifi cally, exceeding drinking guidelines, and drinking in ways problematic enough to elicit complaints from signifi cant others-was the single best independent predictor of intraindividual change in older adults' 20-year alcohol consumption.</p><p>Further work is needed to specify the predictors of the long-term course of alcohol consumption among older adults. Baseline beyond-guideline drinking may foreshadow more rapid decline in 20-year alcohol use because it is a proxy for specifi c negative physiological and psychological experiences (e.g., unpleasant physical and emotional effects of alcohol use) that work to suppress heavier, more frequent alcohol consumption by older adults. Also, drinking behavior at late middle age may be a prime predictor of subsequent alcohol consumption because it is preamble to mediating processes that eventuate in less use of alcohol. For example, changes in health or in signifi cant others' tolerance for alcohol misuse may intervene between beyond-guideline alcohol consumption at baseline in midlife and subsequent decline in drinking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline predictors of late-life drinking-problem trajectories</head><p>Several baseline variables (younger age, beyond-guideline drinking, use of substances to reduce tension, more friends' approval of drinking and [among men only] being unmarried) were signifi cantly associated with more initial drinking problems. In addition, having more baseline health problems, drinking beyond guidelines, using substances to reduce tension, and having more friends who approved of drinking were all independently predictive of more linear decline in negative consequences of drinking over the next 20 years. As indicated by their effects on the quadratic growth factors in our model, baseline drinking beyond guidelines appeared to support a later-life leveling off in drinking problems, whereas more baseline reliance on avoidance coping appeared to detract from it. Overall, these fi ndings suggest that individuals who likely needed at late middle age to curtail their problematic or risky drinking subsequently did so. To enhance understanding and prediction of drinking-problem decline in later life, it would be useful to learn more about self-regulatory health processes, as well as changes in family and friends' reactions to drinking, that mediate between problematic or risky drinking at late middle age and subsequent decline in negative consequences of alcohol use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and implications</head><p>These fi ndings should be interpreted with suitable caution. The drinking trajectories described here have limited generalizability. Our baseline sample was not representative of all older adults with respect to drinking behavior and demographic characteristics, and 20-year mortality removed from the baseline sample more male than female participants as well as participants who had somewhat more drinking problems and fewer social and fi nancial resources. Furthermore, the drinking trajectories described here may be specifi c to the cohort to which our sample belongs. Further research is needed to determine the generalizability of our fi ndings to more representative samples of older adults and to multiwave assessments of late-life drinking behavior that differ from ours in overall duration and spacing of as-sessment intervals. In addition, longitudinal assessments of drinking behavior, using research designs that incorporate multiple same-age cohorts, are needed to determine the generalizability of our fi ndings to drinking behavior of other cohorts of adults as they progress from late-middle to later old age.</p><p>In addition, recent efforts to classify adults' cross-sectional and longitudinal drinking patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jacob et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sacco et al., 2009)</ref> raise the question of whether our sample is homogeneous with regard to 20-year drinking trajectories or might instead comprise multiple classes of individuals who share distinctive 20-year drinking patterns. Future research, using latent growth mixture modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Muthén, 2004)</ref>, should address this question. In this same vein, future research on the longitudinal course and predictors of drinking behaviors that occur with relative infrequency among older adults (e.g., drinking problems, episodic heavy drinking) might profi t by application of two-part growth modeling approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Petras et al., 2010)</ref>, because these potentially can provide unique information about the binary part (whether individuals engage in a drinking behavior) as well as the continuous part (amount of the behavior among those who engage in it) of longitudinal drinking behavior. Future research also should consider time-varying as well as baseline predictors of late-life drinking trajectories in an effort to identify those personal and contextual characteristics most relevant for promoting improved post-midlife drinking behavior and health.</p><p>Notwithstanding these concerns, our findings have potential research and clinical implications. Our fi nding that gender moderates the level and shape of older adults' 20-year alcohol consumption trajectories may help explain earlier, mixed fi ndings about the degree and rate of change in alcohol use in later life. Studies comprised only or mainly of men, those with shorter follow-ups, and investigations spanning only "early" late life may be more likely to show stability or increase in alcohol consumption than are longer longitudinal studies that include older women. Older men's somewhat delayed reduction in alcohol consumption relative to that of older women highlights the importance of health care providers continuing to monitor men's alcohol consumption even well into old age. It implies that, for men, the period spanning late-middle to early old age may be more challenging than formerly thought for reducing alcohol consumption. Health care providers might consider this and adjust accordingly the methods they use to encourage men in this life stage to cut down on alcohol consumption. More broadly, our fi ndings counter the widespread assumption that alcohol consumption and drinking problems invariably and rapidly decline past late middle age and thus have limited relevance as late-life health issues. For many individuals, use of alcohol remains a consistent and important aspect of health status and social functioning even as they advance into later old age. Further work is needed to determine the course and outcomes of late-life alcohol use patterns and whether we can successfully predict and intervene to change long-term drinking patterns that deviate from healthy use of alcohol in later life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Notes:</head><label></label><figDesc>DPDAY0 = drinks per day at baseline; DPDAY1 = drinks per day at Year 1; DPDAY4 = drinks per day at Year 4; DPDAY10 = drinks per day at Year 10; DPDAY20 = drinks per day at Year 20; DRKPRB0 = drinking problems at baseline; DRKPRB1 = drinking problems at Year 1; DRKPRB4 = drinking problems at Year 4; DRKPRB10 = drinking problems at Year 10; DRKPRB20 = drinking problems at Year 20. a Correlations for men are in the lower left of the diagonal (in Roman text) and correlations for women are in the upper right of the diagonal (in italics).</figDesc></figure>
