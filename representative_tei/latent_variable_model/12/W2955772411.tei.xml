			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Metabolomics has emerged as a promising technique to understand relationships between environmental factors and health status. Through comprehensive profiling of small molecules in biological samples, metabolomics generates high-dimensional data objectively, reflecting exposures, endogenous responses, and health effects, thereby providing further insights into exposure-disease associations. However, the multivariate nature of metabolomics data contributes to high complexity in analysis and interpretation. Efficient visualization techniques of multivariate data that allow direct interpretation of combined exposures, metabolome, and disease risk, are currently lacking. We have therefore developed the 'triplot' tool, a novel algorithm that simultaneously integrates and displays metabolites through latent variable modeling (e.g., principal component analysis, partial least squares regression, or factor analysis), their correlations with exposures, and their associations with disease risk estimates or intermediate risk factors. This paper illustrates the framework of the 'triplot' using two synthetic datasets that explore associations between dietary intake, plasma metabolome, and incident type 2 diabetes or BMI, an intermediate risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases. Our results demonstrate advantages of triplot over conventional visualization methods in facilitating interpretation in multivariate risk modeling with high-dimensional data. Algorithms, synthetic data, and tutorials are open source and available in the R package 'triplot'.</p></div>

The role of lifestyle factors in development and progression of NCDs has often been studied in prospective cohorts or case-controlled studies, where associations of specific exposures with health outcomes or intermediate risk markers of NCDs (e.g., blood pressure, lipid profiles, and body weight) are assessed. Several challenges exist in the research on exposure-health relationships, Using metabolomics data to investigate the relationship between exposures and disease risk. In a standard approach, latent variable (LV) modeling (a) is used to achieve a reduced rank approximation of the metabolomics data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Algorithm Description</head><p>The 'triplot' is a novel tool that simultaneously integrates three levels of information, effectively providing interpretable visualization of multivariate associations between exposures, metabolome, and disease risk by superimposing LVs from multivariate modeling of, e.g., metabolomics data with correlations of exposures (or other correlations) and associations with disease risk or intermediate risk markers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). An overview of the functions and workflow of the triplot package is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In the first layer of the triplot, LV modeling is performed on a high-dimensional dataset, generated from, e.g., metabolomics, proteomics or other omics, to reduce the data dimensionality, and to aggregate correlated variables into LVs. The choice of LV modeling method depends on the preference of the user, the data, and the analytical question. The triplot algorithm accepts input from any LV modeling that conforms to reporting observation scores and variable loadings. Frequently used LV algorithms include unsupervised PCA and FA as well as supervised PLS analyses. PCA and FA are used to describe the total variability among the observed (metabolomics) variables using a lower number of LVs called principal components or factors, respectively. PLS is conceptually similar but identifies components that are instead optimized for covariation between the observed (independent) variables and an outcome (dependent) variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>There are several methods to determine the number of LVs to retain in unsupervised LV modeling, i.e., PCA and FA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Among them, a scree plot, which shows how much variation each factor or principal component captures from the data, and very simple structure analysis are commonly used <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For supervised modeling like PLS, the number of LVs should be optimized by cross validation. Out of several cross-validation approaches, repeated double cross validation has shown advantages in estimation of the optimum number of PLS components and estimations of prediction errors over several other commonly used validation approaches, such as k-fold and leave-n-out <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>. A second layer presents correlations between LV observation scores and single or multiple exposures, such as self-reported dietary intakes. Correlation coefficients can be obtained by any correlation methodology that is suitable for the data structure, such as the Pearson method for linear correlations, the Spearman method for non-linear (rank) correlations, or polychoric/polyserial correlation methods for ordinal variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">HealthyNordicDiet</head><p>The original study was set up to explore plasma metabolites that could objectively reflect healthy Nordic dietary patterns in a matched case-controlled study and to assess associations between such patterns and later development of T2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The processing pipeline for the generation and visualization of the original data is described in Supplementary Materials Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>. A global overview of intercorrelations between plasma metabolites related to the healthy Nordic diet, dietary intake variables, as well as T2D risk is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> (Tutorial-Example 1). PC1 constituted a metabolite profile, which directly reflected the healthy Nordic dietary indices and individual food components of the indices and was not associated with T2D risk after adjustment for lifestyle-related factors. PC2 instead, while it was negatively correlated with the healthy Nordic dietary indices, it was predominantly correlated with foods not part of the indices, e.g., margarine, sausages, and poultry, and also more strongly associated with risk of developing T2D, even after adjustment for BMI and lifestyle-related factors (smoking status, education, physical activity, and total energy intake).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">CAMP</head><p>Obesity has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality from NCDs, and high BMI has also been associated with the intake of unhealthy food, i.e., fast food and red/processed meat <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The cross-sectional study of Carbohydrate Alternatives and Metabolic Phenotypes in Chinese young adults was therefore designed to assess relationships between diet, metabolic profiles, and risk factors of metabolic diseases, using both traditional epidemiological approaches and metabolomics techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Intercorrelations between BMI-related plasma metabolites, dietary intakes, and metabolic traits are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> (Tutorial-Example 3). The PCA-based triplot shows that the metabolite profile predicting BMI was strongly associated with liver enzyme activity, i.e., gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>), and also with several other health-related metabolic traits, including fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, as well as high-(HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (data not shown), in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

We also found that a high intake of fruits correlated with BMI-related metabolites and other metabolic traits (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Fruit consumption is widely considered an important part of a healthy diet, which may provide a host of beneficial nutrients, i.e., vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber, and polyphenols, and aid in the reduction of energy intake and body weight. However, conflicting results exist regarding associations between fruit intake and risk factors of NCDs, including BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, as supported by the present investigation. Moreover, PC2 contained high negative loadings of, e.g., phosphatidylcholines containing the marine polyunsaturated fatty acid (C22:6), which in turn correlated positively with seafood intake. From the direct associations of PC2 with liver enzyme activity we then may speculate that the results support the benefits of seafood intake, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on human health <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Of note, the triplot can also be easily constructed based on components derived from supervised modeling of multivariate data (Tutorial-Example 4). To illustrate the wide applicability of the triplot, we performed PLS modeling on the BMI-related metabolites and assessed associations between PLS-derived metabolite components with dietary intakes and metabolic traits, which resulted in similar results as the PCA analysis (Supplementary Materials, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>). The overall direction of the associations obtained using synthetic data was comparable to the results that were obtained from authentic data, although the association between PC1 and high intake of meat was not significant in either synthetic or authentic data (Supplementary Materials, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>). Correlations between PCA components and dietary intakes estimated from food frequency questionnaires were calculated using the partial Spearman method.

Moreover, our results demonstrate how the triplot could provide advantages over conventional methods in terms of visualization and interpretation of modeling results and thus has the potential to assist in extracting biological meaning from complex data.</p></div>

Risk associations were calculated similarly using unconditional logistic regression (OR_AU and OR_U, respectively). Correlations between PCA components and dietary intakes were calculated using partial Pearson method, adjusted for case-controlled status, gender, age, BMI, and lifestyle-related confounders (smoking status, education, and physical activity).
