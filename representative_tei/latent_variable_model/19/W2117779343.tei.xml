The recent availability of high-resolution, multi-band imagery from the ASTER (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer) sensor has enabled us to estimate surface fluxes to bridge the gap between local scale flux measurements using micrometeorological instruments and regional scale land-atmosphere exchanges of water and heat fluxes that are fundamental for the understanding of the water cycle in the Asian monsoon system. A parameterization method based on ASTER data and field observations has been proposed and tested for deriving surface albedo, surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), vegetation coverage, Leaf Area Index (LAI), net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux over heterogeneous land surface in this paper. As a case study, the methodology was applied to the experimental area of the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) Asia-Australia Monsoon Project (CAMP) on the Tibetan Plateau (CAMP/Tibet), located at the north Tibetan Plateau.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The energy and water cycles play an important role in the Asian Monsoon system over the Tibetan Plateau. The Tibetan Plateau contains the world's highest elevation with average elevation about 4000 m relief features. It represents an extensive mass extending from subtropical to middle latitudes and is spanning over 25 degrees of longitude. Because of its topographic character, the plateau surface absorbs a large amount of solar radiation energy (much of which is redistributed by cryospheric processes), and undergoes dramatic seasonal changes of surface heat and water fluxes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ye and Gao, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ye, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yanai et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ye and Wu, Weiqiang Ma et al.:</ref> Estimating surface fluxes 1998; <ref type="bibr">Ma et al., 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ma et al., , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ma and Tsukamoto, 2002)</ref>. The study on the energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere was also of paramount importance for the CAMP/Tibet <ref type="bibr">(Ma et al., 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ma et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ma et al., , 2006))</ref>. Some interesting detailed studies concerning the land surface heat fluxes have been reported (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Yang et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Yang et al., , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yang et al., , 2004;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ma et al., 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Choi et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zuo et al., 2005)</ref>. These researches were, however, on point-level or a local-patch-level. Since the information of land-surface atmosphere interaction is required in this area, the aggregation of the individual results into a regional scale is necessary.</p><p>Remote sensing offers the possibility to derive regional distribution of land surface heat fluxes over heterogeneous land surface in combination with sparse field experimental stations. Remote sensing data provided by satellites are a means of obtaining consistent and frequent observations of spectral albedo and emittance of radiation at elements in a patch landscape and on a global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sellers et al., 1990)</ref>. The land surface variables and vegetation variables, such as surface temperature T sfc , surface hemispherical albedo r 0 , NDVI, MSAVI, LAI and surface thermal emissivity ε can be derived directly from satellite observations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Susskind et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Che'din et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tucker, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wan and Dozier, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Menenti et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Becker and</ref><ref type="bibr">Li, 1990, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Watson et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baret and Guyot, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Price, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kahle and Alley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li and Becker,1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Qi et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Norman et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schmugge et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kustas and Norman, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sobrino and Raissouni, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Su, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ma et al., 2003a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Oku and Ishikawa, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kato, 2005)</ref>. The regional heat fluxes can be determined indirectly with the aid of these land surface variables and vegetation variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Pinker, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Studies have explored several approaches to estimate the regional distribution of surface heat fluxes in recent years. These methods require specification of the vertical temperature difference between the surface temperature and the air temperature and an exchange resistance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kustas et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kustas, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wang et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Menenti et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Menenti and Choudhury, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bastiaanssen, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kustas and Norman, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Su, 2002)</ref>. However, these remote sensing retrieval methods have been performed in homogeneous moist or semiarid regions, and investigations in heterogeneous landscape of high altitudes (e.g. the Tibetan Plateau area) are rare.</p><p>NOAA/AVHRR, GMS and Landsat-7 ETM data were used to determine regional land surface heat fluxes over heterogeneous landscape of the Tibetan Plateau <ref type="bibr">(Ma et al., 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Ma et al., , b, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ma et al., , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Oku et al., 2007)</ref>. However, the resolution of the NOAA/AVHRR and GMS data is about 1 km×1 km and sub-pixel heterogeneity has been omitted. So does Landsat-7 ETM data. The aim of this research is to upscale in-situ point observations of land surface variables and land surface heat fluxes to the regional scale using highresolution (15 m×15 m) ASTER Data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data</head><p>The intensive observation period (IOP) and long-term observation of the CAMP/Tibet have been done successfully in the past seven years. A large amount of data has been collected, which is the best data set so far for the study of energy and water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau. The experimental region, about 150×250 km 2 , includes a variety of land surfaces such as a large area of grassy marshland, some desertification grassland areas, many small rivers and several lakes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The recent availability of high-resolution, multi-band imagery from the ASTER sensor has enabled us to estimate surface fluxes. ASTER covers a wide spectral region with 14 bands from the visible to the thermal infrared with high spatial, spectral and radiometric resolution. The spatial resolution varies with wavelength: 15 m in the visible and nearinfrared (VNIR, 0.52-0.86 µm), 30 m in the short wave infrared (SWIR, 1.6-2.43 µm), and 90 m in the thermal infrared (TIR, 8.1-11.6 µm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Yamaguchi, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The most relevant data, collected at the CAMP/Tibet surface stations (sites) to support the parameterization of land surface heat fluxes and analysis of ASTER images in this paper, consist of surface radiation budget components, surface radiation temperature, surface albedo, vertical profiles of air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction measured at the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) towers, Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs), radio sonde, turbulent fluxes measured by eddy correlation technique, soil heat flux, soil temperature profiles, soil moisture profiles, and the vegetation state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Theory and scheme</head><p>The general concept of the methodology is shown in a diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The surface albedo for shortwave radiation (r 0 ) is retrieved from narrowband-broadband conversion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Liang (2001)</ref>. ASTER has nine bands. It is expected that so many bands should enable us to convert narrowband to broadband albedos effectively. Liang found that the conversions are quite linear. The land surface temperature (T sfc ) is derived using a method developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hook (1992)</ref> from multispectral thermal infrared data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hook (1992)</ref> also evaluated a technique to extract emissivity information from multispectral thermal infrared data. The techniques are the assumed Channel 5 emittance model (reference channel model). They permit emissivity information to be derived from all five ASTER channels. The assumed Channel 5 emittance model only permits emissivity values to be derived from four of the five ASTER channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hook, 1992)</ref>. The radiative transfer model MODTRAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berk et al., 1989)</ref> computes the downward shortwave and longwave radiation at the surface. With these results the surface net radiation flux (R n ) is determined. On the basis of the field observations, the soil heat flux (G 0 )   is estimated from R n . The sensible heat flux (H ) is estimated from T sf c , and regional latent heat flux (λE) is derived as the residual of the energy budget theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liou, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ma, 2006)</ref> for land surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Net radiation</head><p>The regional net radiation flux is derived from</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R n (x, y) = K ↓ (x, y) -K ↑ (x, y) + L ↓ (x, y) -L ↑ (x, y) = (1 -r 0 (x, y)) • K ↓ (x, y) + L ↓ (x, y) -ε 0 (x, y)σ T 4 sf c (x, y)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ε 0 (x, y) is surface emissivity, K ↓ (W m -2 ) represents the shortwave (0.3-3 µm) and L ↓ (W m -2 ) is the longwave (3-100 µm) radiation components, respectively.

The model atmosphere used in MODTRAN is midlatitude summer with slant atmospheric path. The model of execution is thermal radiance. The other, such as temperature, pressure, wator vapor, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, other gases, altitude profile, are set to midlatitude summer. Aerosols model used is rural VIS=23 km. Ground altitude above sea level is 4.5 km. Surface temperature T sfc (x,y) (K) in Eq.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>     and land surface heat fluxes (net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux) derived from satellite data were compared with the field measurements at BJ site (The BJ site is named after the nearby village BJ, which derived its name from the village chief who is called BUJIAO).</p><p>The measured surface soil heat fluxes were calculated from soil heat flux measured at -10 cm and the soil temperature measured at surface and -10 cm.

The derived surface variables (land surface albedo and surface temperature) and surface heat fluxes (net radiation flux R n , soil heat flux G 0 , sensible heat flux H and latent heat flux λE) in three different months over the study area are in good accordance with the land surface status. The experimental area includes variety of land surfaces such as a large area of grassy marshland, some desertification grassland areas, many small rivers and several lakes; therefore these derived parameters show a wide range due to the strong contrast of surface features. Surface albedo is from 0.01 to 0.34 in July and from 0. 2. The derived pixel value (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>) and average value (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6</ref>) of surface temperature, net radiation flux, soil heat flux and latent heat flux in July are higher than that in March and November. It means that there is much more evaporation in summer than in winter in the north Tibetan Plateau area. It is also pointed out that the heating density (H +λE=Rn-G 0 ) in summer is much higher than that in winter in the central Tibetan Plateau area. This is caused by the high solar radiation and lower albedo in the summer and conversely the lower solar radiation and higher albedo in the winter.    Most of the land surface is covered by green grass in summer and it is covered by snow and ice during winter on the experimental area.</p><p>3. The derived net radiation flux over the study area is very close to the field measurement with APD less than 3.1% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). It is the result of the improvement on surface albedo and surface temperature.</p><p>4. The regional soil heat flux derived from the relationship between soil heat flux and net radiation flux is suitable for heterogeneous land surface of the CAMP/Tibet area, and the APD is less than 9.8% at the validation sites (Table 2), because the relationship itself was derived from the same area <ref type="bibr">(Ma et al., 2002b)</ref>.</p><p>5. The derived regional sensible heat flux and latent heat flux with APD less than 9.8% at the validation sites in the CAMP/Tibet area is in good agreement with field measurements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). This is due to the fact that atmospheric boundary layer processes have been considered in more detail in our methodology and the proposed parameterization for sensible heat flux and latent heat flux can be used over the north Tibetan Plateau area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Concluding remarks</head><p>In this study, the regional distributions of land surface variables (surface albedo and surface temperature) and land surface heat fluxes (net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux) over the heterogeneous north Tibetan Plateau area were derived with the aid of ASTER data and field observations. Reasonable results of land surface variables, vegetation variables and land surface fluxes were gained in this study. The retrieval of regional land surface heat fluxes over heterogeneous landscape is not an easy task. The parameteri-zation method presented in this study is still in developing stage:</p><p>1. Only three ASTER images are used in this study. To obtain more accurate regional land surface fluxes (daily to seasonal variations) over a larger area (the Tibetan Plateau), more field observations (ABL tower and radiation measurement system, radiosonde system, turbulent fluxes measured by eddy correlation technique, soil moisture and soil temperature measurement system etc.) and other satellite sensors such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) with more frequent temporal coverage have to be used. It is also worth trying SEBI (Surface Energy Balance Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Menenti and Choudhury, 1993)</ref>) method and SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Su, 2002)</ref>).</p><p>2. This study implies the parameterization method is only applicable to clear-sky days (to apply MODTRAN and derive surface temperature). In order to extend its applicability to cloudy skies, we should consider using microwave remote sensing to derive surface temperature and other land surface variables.</p><p>Vegetation variables cannot be validated in this study because there were no such measurements during the field experiments. More attention should be paid to the measurements of vegetation variables in the coming experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Surface temperature ranged from 0 • C to 51.65 • C in July and from -10.3 • C to 36.8 • C in March and November. Net radiation flux changed from 570 W m -2 to 830 W m -2 in July and from 80 W m -2 to 655 W m -2 in March and November. Soil heat flux varied from 100 W m -2 to 220 W m -2 in July and from 0 W m -2 to 180 W m -2 in March and November. Sensible heat flux is from 0 W m -2 to 540 W m -2 in July and from 0 W m -2 to 520 W m -2 in March and November, and latent heat flux varied from 0 W m -2 to 736 W m -2 in July and 0 W m -2 to 288 W m -2 in March and November (see Figs.3 and 5). Surface albedo, surface temperature and sensible heat flux around the lake in the distribution maps are much higher in July, and at the same time, net radiation flux, soil heat flux and latent heat flux are lower in the area. The reason is that the predominant land cover around the lake is composed by desertificated grass which was dry at the time of the measurement.</figDesc></figure>
