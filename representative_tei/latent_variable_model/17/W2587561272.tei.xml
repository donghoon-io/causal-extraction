<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA) is a recently developed Bayesian ideal observer method for task-specific dimensionality reduction. Given a training set of proximal stimuli (e.g. retinal images), a response noise model, and a cost function, AMA returns the filters (i.e. receptive fields) that extract the most useful stimulus features for estimating a userspecified latent variable from those stimuli. Here, we first contribute two technical advances that significantly reduce AMA's compute time: we derive gradients of cost functions for which two popular estimators are appropriate, and we implement a stochastic gradient descent (AMA-SGD) routine for filter learning. Next, we show how the method can be used to simultaneously probe the impact on neural encoding of natural stimulus variability, the prior over the latent variable, noise power, and the choice of cost function. Then, we examine the geometry of AMA's unique combination of properties that distinguish it from betterknown statistical methods. Using binocular disparity estimation as a concrete test case, we develop insights that have general implications for understanding neural encoding and decoding in a broad class of fundamental sensory-perceptual tasks connected to the energy model. Specifically, we find that non-orthogonal (partially redundant) filters with scaled additive noise tend to outperform orthogonal filters with constant additive noise; non-orthogonal filters and scaled additive noise can interact to sculpt noise-induced stimulus encoding uncertainty to match task-irrelevant stimulus variability. Thus, we show that some properties of neural response thought to be biophysical nuisances can confer coding advantages to neural systems. Finally, we speculate that, if repurposed for the problem of neural systems identification, AMA may be able to overcome a fundamental limitation of standard subunit model estimation. As natural stimuli become more widely used in the study of psychophysical and neurophysiological performance, we expect that task-specific methods for feature learning like AMA will become increasingly important.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Perception science seeks to determine how perceiving organisms estimate behaviorally relevant properties of the environment based on proximal stimuli captured by the senses. Understanding the details of the sensory-perceptual processing that support these abilities with natural stimuli is a primary focus of research. It is widely appreciated that some stimulus features are more useful for some tasks than others, more likely to increase a given neuron's response rate than others, and more likely to excite neurons in one brain area than another. This specificity suggests that perceptual and neural performance in particular tasks is driven by sets of features that are of much lower dimensionality than the proximal stimuli themselves. As a consequence, methods for reducing stimulus dimensionality are in widespread use in perception and neuroscience research.</p><p>Models of information encoding with natural stimuli are often developed without regard to what information will be decoded from the encoded signals. Efficient coding, and many statistical methods for data characterization (e.g. PCA, ICA), are designed to capture statistical properties of proximal (observable) stimuli without explicit consideration of the sensory-perceptual or behavioral goals for which the encoded information will be used <ref type="bibr">[1,2] [3-9]</ref>. The efficient coding hypothesis has been remarkably influential. However, as Simoncelli &amp; Olshausen (2001) point out, the hypothesis "states only that information must be represented efficiently; it does not say anything about what information should be represented" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Empirical studies in psychophysics and systems neuroscience often focus on the behavioral limits and neurophysiological underpinnings of performance in specific tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Thus, there is a partial disconnect between popular task-independent theories of encoding (e.g. efficient coding) and the methodological practices often followed by psychophysics and sensory and systems neuroscience.</p><p>Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA) provides a principled, data-driven approach to finding the stimulus features that are most useful for specific tasks (e.g. estimation of a variable latent in the stimulus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. AMA thus addresses a need that is not directly addressed by standard efficient encoding frameworks. In conjunction with carefully calibrated natural image databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, AMA has provided predictions for the encoding filters (receptive fields) that support optimal performance in several fundamental tasks in early vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. These receptive fields have, in turn, aided the development of ideal observers for the estimation of figure-ground, defocus blur, binocular disparity, retinal speed, and motion-in-depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The predictions of these ideal observers are biologically plausible, dovetail with available neurophysiological data, and can tightly predict human performance with natural and artificial stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. These results may represent the beginnings of an important step forward in our ability, as a science, to develop ideal observer theories of mid-level visual tasks that act directly on natural retinal images.</p><p>AMA does not come without a set of constraints and disadvantages. The most important constraint is that the stimuli must be contrast normalized before processing. This constraint is appropriate for many perceptual tasks for which the task-relevant information is contained in the pattern of contrast over space and time, but it renders the method ill-suited for tasks in which the primary source of information is contained in the magnitude (intensity) of a stimulus. Second, the AMA cost landscape is non-convex, so guarantees cannot be made that local minima found by the method represent the global minimum; standard techniques for protecting against non-global local minima must be used (e.g. random starts). However, for the set of problems for which AMA is well-suited, its most glaring disadvantage is its computational cost: compute time is quadratic in the number of elements in the training set. Without specialized computing resources, the computational cost renders the method impractical for use on large-scale problems.</p><p>The aims of this paper are four-fold. First, to set our contribution in context, we re-derive the original equations for AMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, developing intuitions along the way. Second, we derive the gradient of the cost (objective function) for two popular cost functions-0,1 cost (L0 norm) and squared error cost (L2 norm)-and implement a stochastic gradient descent procedure for filter learning, which we call AMA-SGD. (source code at: <ref type="url" target="http://www.github.com/BurgeLab/AMA">http://www.github.com/BurgeLab/AMA</ref>). These advances significantly reduce the method's compute time, thereby rendering it a more practical tool for research on problems of wide spread interest in vision re-search and sensory and systems neuroscience. Third, we show that AMA can be used to examine the relative impact on optimal coding of stimulus variability and priors over the latent variable. Fourth, we show how scaled additive encoding noise (i.e. additive noise with response variance proportional to the response mean) and correlated (i.e. non-orthogonal) filters can interact to confer coding advantages in certain tasks. We believe that the work presented here may help establish a general normative framework for understanding the diversity of tuning and response properties exhibited by neurophysiological receptive fields in cortex, and how they may contribute to task-specific processing of sensory stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>In this section, we first review the derivation of the main equations for Accuracy Maximization Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, explaining the logic and geometric intuitions behind the method. This review is meant to provide context for the current paper and a tutorial on the original method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and Setup</head><p>Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA) provides a closed-form expression for the optimal (nonlinear) decoding rule given five factors: i) a well-defined task (i.e. a latent variable to estimate from high-dimensional stimuli), ii) a labeled training set of stimuli, iii) a particular set of filters (receptive fields), iv) a noisy filter response model, and v) a cost function <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1A)</ref>. Given these factors, the problem of finding the encoding filters that are optimal for a particular task reduces to searching for the filters that minimize the cost (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). The Background and Setup section is ordered to follow the block diagram in Fig 1A . 
Specifying the task with a labeled training set. Accuracy Maximization Analysis requires a training set. Each stimulus in the training set is labeled by a value of the latent variable to be estimated. The task is implicitly defined by the labeling of the training set. If the training set is too small, or if the stimuli contained within the training set are not representative, results obtained via AMA may generalize poorly. The task-specific filters learned via AMA are therefore only as solid as the training set itself. Thus, the first (and often quite difficult) step in the fruitful use of AMA is to obtain labeled training sets that are accurate, and are sufficiently large to be representative of the general case.</p><p>The training set and the latent variable labels define the task and specify the joint probability distribution p(X,s) between the latent variable and the stimuli (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Thus, the training set implicitly defines the prior probability distribution over the latent variable, which can be obtained by marginalizing out the stimuli from the joint distribution: pðXÞ ¼ X s pðX; sÞ. If AMA is being used to make normative prescriptions for the design of biological and/or The logic of Accuracy Maximization Analysis. A Factors that determine the optimal non-linear decoder, g(Á). For any particular filter set, the optimal decoder provides a closed form expression for the cost by i) computing the posterior probability over the latent variable p(X|R), and ii) reading out the optimal estimate b X opt from the posterior that minimizes the cost. B AMA begins with a labeled training set. Each individual stimulus in the training set, s ij , must be labeled with a particular value of the latent variable of interest, X i . The labeling of the training set implicitly defines the task. Subsequent steps to finding optimal task-specific filters via AMA are: i) select a particular stimulus s kl from the labeled training set; ii) obtain a noisy filter response R kl from a given (possibly non-optimal) set of initial filters; iii) use the optimal non-linear decoder to obtain the optimal estimate and its expected cost; iv) repeat for each stimulus in the training set and compute the average cost across the training set; v) update the filters to reduce the cost; vi) repeat until the average cost across the training set is minimized. The filters that minimize the cost are the optimal task-specific filters. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005281.g001 machine vision systems, it is of potential interest to examine the influence of the prior on the encoding functions, and on eventual performance in the task. The experimenter has at least two options in this regard.</p><p>First, the experimenter can attempt to match the prior probability distribution in the training set to the prior probability of occurrence in natural viewing conditions. Unfortunately, accurate measurements of prior probability distributions relevant to particular perceptual tasks have proved notoriously difficult to obtain, especially if the latent variable of interest is i) a property of the distal environment (e.g. depth, object motion, surface reflectance), or ii) a property of the relationship between the environment and the vision system (e.g. distance, focus error, binocular disparity, retinal image motion). Progress has been made in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, but with this approach comes significant technical challenges.</p><p>Second, the experimenter can manipulate the prior probability distribution over the latent variable by varying the number of stimuli per latent variable value in the training set. This approach is simple (in comparison to the first approach) and provides the experimenter a useful tool for examining the influence of the prior on the properties of the optimal filters Fig 2 ). If the optimal filters are brittle-that is, if they are very sensitive to modest variations in the shape of the prior-then the effort required by the first approach may be justified. On the other hand, if the optimal filters are insensitive to reasonable variations in the prior, then the prior can be safely ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In general, the better the information in the proximal stimuli about the latent variable (the more reliable the measurements), the less important will become the prior.</p><p>Filter response model. The response model specifies how a particular filter f responds to an arbitrary stimulus s, thereby providing the conditional probability p(R|s) of a noisy filter response R to an arbitrary proximal stimulus s (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Given that our specific interest is to understand task-specific information processing in sensory-perceptual tasks, it is advantageous for the encoding model to be consistent with the properties of biological encoders (i.e. receptive fields). Here, we consider a Gaussian response model with scaled additive (i.e. Poisson-like) noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We chose this response model for two reasons. First, its Gaussian form is mathematically convenient. Second, and more importantly, scaled additive noise is a widely accepted simple model of neural noise in early visual cortex. However, the filter response model can in principle be modified to be consistent with other noise models (e.g. Poisson, Bernoulli). For a given encoding filter f t from set of filters f = [f 1 f 2 Á Á Á f q ], its mean response r t , noisy response R t , noise samples η, and response noise variance s 2 t to stimulus j having latent variable level i are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r ij;t ¼ f T t s ij<label>ð1aÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">R ij;t ¼ r ij;t þ Z<label>ð1bÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Z $ Nð0; s 2 ij;t Þ<label>ð1cÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">s 2 ij;t ¼ ajr ij;t j þ s 2 0<label>ð1dÞ</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s ij ¼ x ij À x ij kx ij À x ij k</formula><p>is a mean-subtracted, contrast normalized (ksk = 1.0) version of a (possibly noisy) intensity stimulus x ij , f t is a vector of encoding weights constrained to have a magnitude of 1.0 (kf t k = 1.0), η is a sample of zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance s 2 ij . In the general case, the noise variance is given by a linear function of the mean response with fano-factor α and baseline variance s 2 0 . When the fano-factor equals 0.0, the noise model is additive and the response variance is a constant, regardless of the mean response. When the fano-factor is nonzero, response noise variance increases approximately in proportion to the mean response. For the results presented in the paper, we set the fano-factor equal to 1.36 and the baseline variance equal to 0.23 (spk/sec) 2 , values that are consistent with neural response properties in early visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. If N q filters are considered simultaneously, the variables in Eqs 1a-1d become vectors-mean response vector r = [r 1 r 2 Á Á Á r q ], noisy response vector R = [R 1 R 2 Á Á Á R q ], and response covariance matrix ∑ with on-diagonal elements diagðSÞ ¼ ðs 2  1 ; s 2 2 ; Á Á Á ; s 2 q Þ-and the filter response distribution p(R|s ij ) becomes N q dimensional. In this manuscript, we consider independent response noise (diagonal covariance matrix), but the impact of correlated response noise could also be examined.</p><p>Bayes Optimal Decoder: Posterior Probability Distribution and Cost of Optimal Estimator. The optimal decoder provides a closed form expression for the cost for any particular filter set given the training stimuli. The decoder determines the cost by first computing the posterior probability over the latent variable p(X|R), and then reading out the optimal estimate b X opt from the posterior that minimizes the cost. Here, following Geisler et al (2009), we present the derivation of the posterior probability of the latent variable X in a labeled training set given the responses of a noisy set of encoders (i.e. filters) to a given stimulus s kl with latent variable value</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X k p X k jR k; l ð Þ ð Þ ¼ pðRðk; lÞjX k ÞpðX k Þ X N jvj i¼1 pðRðk; lÞjX i ÞpðX i Þ<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>The conditional probability of the encoder response given can be expressed as pðRjX i Þ ¼</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">X N i i¼1 pðRjs ij Þpðs ij jX i Þ where p(R|s) is defined by Eqs 1a-1d.

Specifically, the prior probability of each latent variable value p(X i ) is the number of stimuli having that label over the total number of stimuli in the training set N i /N. The probability of each stimulus, conditioned on its latent variable value X i is 1/N i where N i is the number of stimuli with that label in the training set. Substituting</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p X k jR k; l ð Þ ð Þ ¼ X N k m¼1 p R k; l ð Þjs km ð Þ 1 N k " # N k N X N jvj i¼1 X N i j¼1 p R k; l ð Þjs ij 1 N i " # N i N<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Canceling terms yields the relatively simple expression for the posterior probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p X k jR k; l ð Þ ð Þ ¼ X N k m¼1 pðRðk; lÞjs km Þ X N jvj i¼1 X N i j¼1 pðRðk; lÞjs ij Þ<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>Eq 5 indicates that the posterior probability is given by the sum of the within-level stimulus likelihoods, normalized by the sum of all stimulus likelihoods. Fig 3A provides a graphical representation of AMA posterior, for a simple hypothetical case in which there is one filter and two latent variable values, each with two stimuli (i.e. four stimuli total). Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> shows response distributions for the same hypothetical stimuli, in the slightly more complicated case in which there are two filters.</p><p>With the expression for the posterior probability distribution, the next step is to define a cost function. The cost function specifies the penalty assigned to different types of error. For certain cost functions, the optimal estimator associated with that cost function can be determined analytically (see Supporting Information). Here, we remain agnostic about the particular cost function to be used. Later, we derive the cost (and the gradient of the cost) associated with two popular cost functions for which the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and minimum measured squared error estimators (MMSE) are the optimal estimators.</p><p>The cost associated with the noisy response to an individual stimulus is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C kl ¼ X N lvl u¼1 gð b X opt ; X u ÞpðX u jRðk; lÞÞ<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where gð b X opt ; X k Þ is the cost associated with the difference between the estimate and the true latent variable value X k when the estimate is the optimal estimate b X opt for the cost function. The overall cost for a given set of filters applied to the training set data is given by the expected cost across for each stimulus averaged over all stimuli</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C ¼ 1 N X N k;l E Rðk;lÞ C kl ½ ¼ 1 N X N k;l C kl<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where C kl ¼ E Rðk;lÞ ½C kl is the expected cost associated with the kl th stimulus. The goal of the accuracy maximization analysis is to obtain the filters f that minimize the overall cost. Namely, where the optimal filters f opt are the filters that minimize the expected cost across the training set. We use numerical methods to determine the optimal filters because there exists no closed form solution.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f opt ¼ arg min f C<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>A schematic of the filter learning process via gradient descent is shown in Fig 4 . It shows how the filter response distributions, the corresponding posterior probability distribution over the latent variable, and the cost evolves as the filters improve. As the filters improve, response distributions to stimuli having the same level of the latent variable become more similar, while response distributions to stimuli with different latent variable values become more dissimilar. This increases the likelihood of within-level stimulus confusions, and decreases the likelihood of between-level stimulus confusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMA Cost Function: Derivation of Gradients</head><p>Gradient descent routines require the gradient of the cost function. The gradient must be determined numerically (e.g. finite differences) if an analytic expression is not known. The computational cost of numerically evaluating the gradient is proportional to the number of dimensions required to define the gradient itself. Methods for numerical evaluation typically proceed by taking a small step of size ε in each of N d directions. In our case, N d is the number of dimensions that define each filter (i.e. receptive field). For example, a filter that processes a 15x15 pixel image is defined by 225 dimensions, one dimension for each pixel. Thus, the gradient of the cost with respect to the filter is 225 dimensional. An analytical expression for the gradient can be expected to yield computational savings equal to a factor N d less the time required to evaluate the gradient. This improvement in speed can be substantial for problems in which the stimuli and filters are relatively high dimensional.</p><p>Here, we derive the gradient of the cost for two popular cost functions: the 0,1 cost function (i.e. L0 norm) and the squared error cost function (i.e. L2 norm). These two cost functions are commonly used in the fields of vision research, visual neuroscience, statistics, and machine learning. They also represent opposite extremes of commonly used cost functions. The 0,1 cost function penalizes all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude. The squared error cost function penalizes small errors minimally and large errors severely. We reason that if the behavior of the algorithm is understood for these two cost functions, reasonable inferences can be made about algorithm's behavior for intermediate cost functions (e.g. L1 norm).</p><p>The optimal estimator for the L0 norm cost function is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator (see S4 Text). In the present case, the expected L0 cost across all stimuli is closely related to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the observed posterior and an idealized posterior with all its mass at the correct level of the latent variable (S5 Text); for both statistics, the expected cost is a function only of the probability mass at the correct level of the latent variable. Thus, the appropriate estimator for both measures is the posterior maximum (i.e. the MAP estimator). The optimal estimator for the L2 norm cost function is the mean of the posterior probability distribution, or the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator (see S6 Text).</p><p>Gradient of 0,1 (L0 norm) cost function. This expression for the 0,1 cost is closely related to the average KL-divergence between the posterior probability distribution and a hypothetical posterior probability distribution that has all its mass at the correct latent variable level (S5 Text). The KL-divergence cost for a noisy response to a particular stimulus is given by the negative log-posterior probability at the correct level <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> C kl ¼ À log pðX k jRðk; lÞÞ ð9Þ</p><p>The expected cost across all stimuli depends on the expected cost for each individual stimulus (Eq 7). We use the approximation log p(X k |r(k,l)) ffi E R(k,l) [log p(X k |R(k,l))] to calculate the expected cost for each stimulus (see Appendix, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Note that AMA-SGD can learn filters with noisy responses and without the approximation, but results are robust to this choice, so we use the approximation for convenience.</p><p>By defining Y k (k,l) and Z(k,l) as the numerator and denominator of the posterior probability distribution given a noisy response R(k,l) to stimulus s kl (see Eq 5), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C kl ¼ À ½logY k ðk; lÞ À logZðk; lÞ<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>Taking the gradient of the cost with respect to the receptive fields f and dropping the index (k,l) for notational simplicity yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">r f q C kl ¼ À r f q Y k Y k À r f q Z Z !<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>Finally, plugging Eq 11 into Eq 7, and yields the expression for the expected cost over the entire training set</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">r f q C ¼ À 1 N X N kl r f q Y k Y k À r f q Z Z !<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>Thus, finding the gradient of the KL-divergence cost reduces to finding the gradient of the log posterior probability, which further reduces to finding the gradient of the numerator and the gradient of the denominator of the posterior probability distribution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMA-SGD (Accuracy Maximization Analysis with Stochastic Gradient Descent)</head><p>Motivation: reducing computational run-time. The primary drawback of AMA is its computational expense. The compute time associated with the evaluation of the posterior probability distribution for all stimuli in the dataset requires N 2 N lvl operations, where N is the total number of samples in the training set and N lvl is the number of levels (i.e. values) of the latent variable represented in the training set. For example, a training set with 10,000 stimuli and 20 categories requires 2 billion operations per evaluation of the posterior probability distribution. The required compute time is significant enough as to render the method impractical for use on large-scale problems.</p><p>There are at least two methods for achieving significant computational savings in optimization problems: employing stochastic gradient descent routines, and employing models with strong distributional or parametric assumptions. Each has its drawbacks. Stochastic gradient descent routines are noisy and may not converge to the optimum value when the problem is non-convex. Models with strong parametric assumptions will, in general, only be appropriate for a restricted set of cases for which the assumptions approximately hold. Both approaches, however, offer the potential benefit of drastic improvements in the speed of convergence. In this paper, we focus on stochastic gradient descent; future work will explore models with stronger parametric assumptions.</p><p>Stochastic gradient descent has the potential to significantly reduce compute-time when the time to evaluate the objective function increases super-linearly with the number of elements in the training set <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which is the case here. The expected reduction in compute-time depends on the size of the batch relative to the size of the full training set. On each iteration, a batch of stimuli of size N bch is selected randomly from the total number of stimuli in the training set. Let k = N/N bch be the ratio between the size of the training set and the size of each batch. Evaluating the N bch posterior probability distributions associated with each batch requires N 2 k 2 N lvl operations. On each pass through the dataset, k batches must be evaluated so that the full training set is used during filter learning. All other things equal, evaluating the cost for each pass through the full dataset is therefore of order N bch N lvl N, a factor of k faster than AMA. Thus, AMA-SGD has the potential to reduce the time required to learn filters from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the training set.</p><p>Updating the filters. The problem under consideration is a constrained optimization problem because the filters must have a vector magnitude (L2 norm) of 1.0. The geometric interpretation of this constraint is that the filters lie on a hyper-sphere of unit radius that is centered at the origin. Therefore, the direction of steepest descent that satisfies the constraint lies on the tangent plane of the hyper-sphere at the point specified by the current filter values f.</p><p>To determine this direction, the gradient of the cost function in the unconstrained space is first obtained, f euclid (Eqs 12 and 18). Next, the gradient in the unconstrained space is projected onto the tangent plane of the hypersphere (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The gradient in the unconstrained space can be expressed as a vector sum of its component in the tangent plane and its component in a direction perpendicular to the tangent plane at the point f. On a hyper-sphere, the direction perpendicular to the tangent plane at f is the vector f itself. Hence, the projection of the gradient in this direction is (f T f euclid )f. Therefore, from vector addition, the projection of the gradient on the tangent plane of the sphere at f is</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">f grd ¼ f euclid À ðf T f euclid Þf<label>ð19Þ</label></formula><p>The unit vector f grd /kf grd k therefore represents the direction satisfying the constraints in which the cost function is changing most rapidly.</p><p>Taking a step. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm is iterative. After each iteration, the filter values are updated by taking a step in the direction of steepest descent that satisfies the constraints. We take a step from the current (old) value of the receptive fields f (old) to the new value of the receptive fields f (new) in the direction of steepest descent that satisfies the constraint. In particular, the updated receptive fields are given by f ðnewÞ ¼ f ðoldÞ À ε</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">f ðoldÞ grd f ðoldÞ grd</formula><p>where ε is the step size. A step in the direction of steepest descent generally updates the filter values such that cost decreases. However, because batch stochastic gradient descent randomly selects random batches of training stimuli on each iteration, stimuli in some batches may be 'easy' while stimuli in other batches may be 'hard'. Thus, some batches may produce lower costs irrespective of the properties of the filters. Therefore, on each iteration, the updated filter values are preserved for the next iteration only if the value of the cost function for the current batch decreases after the update. By randomly choosing the batches over a large number of iterations, the algorithm, in expectation, converges to the optimum.</p><p>Choosing a step size. The problem of choosing an appropriate step size in a gradient descent algorithm has received a good deal of attention in the statistics and machine learning literature. Various methods have been proposed for how to choose step sizes that optimize the rate of convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Many of these methods adapt the step size to the structure of the cost function, and have demonstrated desirable convergence properties. A formal investigation Using projection to satisfy the filter constraint. A To enforce the constraint that the filters have unit vector magnitude (i.e. kfk = 1.0), the filters are projected onto the tangent plane of the unit hypersphere. The vector difference between the gradient in the unconstrained space f euclid , and the projection of that gradient onto a unit vector perpendicular to the tangent plane of the hypersphere at f (which is identically equal to f) gives the gradient of the cost in the tangent plane of the hypersphere f grd . Changing the value of the filters by taking a small step in the direction of f grd ensures that the step will be in the direction that reduces the cost the fastest while still satisfying the constraint that the vector magnitude (i.e. L2 norm) of the filter remain 1.0. of how best to choose the step size is beyond the scope of this paper. We followed three basic principles. First, the step size should not be too big; otherwise the algorithm may never converge to the optimum value. Second, the step size should not be too small; otherwise, the algorithm may require a very large number of iterations to achieve convergence. Third, the step size should decrease as the number of iterations increases. We obtained good performance by programming our routine to decrease step size 1.0% on each iteration and to quit after a certain limiting number of iterations. There is clearly room for improvement in this procedure. The results presented here thus represent a lower bound on performance.</p><p>Choosing a batch size. The AMA-SGD method developed here uses stochastic batch gradient descent. On each iteration of a batch gradient descent method, a batch of stimuli of a certain size is chosen at random from the training set, the cost and gradient is computed from the batch, and then a step is taken in the direction of the gradient. The choice of batch size is left to the user. It is tempting to choose the smallest possible batch size because the smaller the batches, the more significant the improvement in speed (see above). However, if batch size is too small, filters learned via AMA-SGD will not converge to the filters learned with AMA (see Results). Choosing a batch size is therefore a trade-off between computational speed and accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To demonstrate the value of AMA-SGD, we use the task of estimating binocular disparity from natural stereo-images <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> as a concrete test case. In the context of this task, we show that AMA-SGD converges, dramatically improves the speed of filter learning, and returns the same filters as AMA given sufficiently large batch sizes. Then, we demonstrate that the optimal filters are highly robust to changes in the prior probability distribution, overall noise power, and cost function. We note that these results are not unique to the task of disparity estimation; similar convergence and filter robustness results are obtained for several other tasks. (Labeled training sets for the related tasks of estimating binocular disparity and retinal speed from natural stimuli are available at <ref type="url" target="http://www.github.com/burgelab/AMA">http://www.github.com/burgelab/AMA</ref>). Finally, in the discussion section, we examine the general implications of the these results for understanding neural coding with biologically realistic noise models (i.e. noise variance that increases with the mean).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binocular Disparity Estimation</head><p>Binocular disparities are the local differences between the left and right eye retinal images due to the different vantage point each eye has on the world. Binocular disparities are used for fixating the eyes and for computing the depth structure of scenes (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6A</ref>). But the disparities themselves must be estimated before they can be used for depth perception.</p><p>The estimation of binocular disparity is a classic problem in vision science, and is often referred to as the stereo-correspondence problem. The behavioral limits and neural mechanisms of disparity estimation have been extensively investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. However, until recently there was no ideal observer for estimating disparity in natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To develop this ideal observer, Burge &amp; Geisler (2014) first obtained a labeled training set of randomly selected 1 deg binocular retinal images of natural scenes with disparities ranging between -15 to 15 arcmin (400 binocular stimuli x 19 disparity levels = 7600 total). Physiological optics, and the wavelength sensitivity and spatial sampling of the foveal photoreceptors were accurately modeled. AMA was then used to find the small population (n = 8) of binocular filters that extract the most useful information in natural images for the task. Additional filters yielded little improvement, suggesting that eight binocular filters capture most of the available task-relevant information. The properties of the filters mimic the receptive fields of disparity sensitive neurons in cortex, and optimal disparity decoding predicts many aspects of human disparity estimation and discrimination performance. Please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Burge &amp; Geisler (2014)</ref> for extensive details on the training set, the ideal observer for disparity estimation, and the role AMA played in its development.</p><p>The As the responses get farther from the origin, the posterior probability distributions have more of their mass at the correct level of the latent variable.</p><p>The filter response distributions in Fig 6C , and the manner in which they change with the value of the latent variable, are similar to the response distributions obtained for other tasks/ coding problems that have been modeled with 'energy-like' computations (e.g. disparityenergy, motion-energy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>: the information about the latent variable is carried primarily by the covariance of the filter responses. This characteristic pattern of filter response will inform subsequent analyses of how interactions between filter correlation, response noise, and stimulus distributions impact encoding fidelity (see Discussion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMA-SGD Performance</head><p>Convergence &amp; run-time improvements. In this section, we demonstrate AMA-SGD's convergence properties. The disparity filters (c.f. Fig 6 ) were learned with the original AMA model and therefore constitute a benchmark for AMA-SGD. Here, we examine the effect of batch size on the convergence properties, run-time improvements, and the validity of AMA-SGD filters. Stochastic gradient descent is a noisy process by design. Thus, it is important to verify that AMA-SGD converges. Descent of the cost function should be noisier with small batches and   Batch size effects. The faster convergence times obtained with AMA-SGD are advantageous only if the resulting filters are the same as those obtained by AMA. The previous section showed that the most dramatic reductions in run-time occur with the smallest batches. It is therefore tempting to use very small batches when learning filters. However, there is a tradeoff between computational gains and accuracy of the filters. AMA-SGD only returns filters identical to those returned by AMA if the batch size is sufficiently large.</p><p>To understand why the filters critically depend on batch size, consider the case in which the batch size is so small that there is only one stimulus per level in the average batch. In this case, the probability of response conditioned on a particular value of the latent variable is identical to the probability of the response conditioned on the stimulus having that level: p(R|X i ) = p(R| s ij ). Thus, the posterior probability of the latent variable is identical to the posterior probability of the stimulus, and the filters that best identify the latent variable are identical to the filters that best identify each stimulus. Therefore, as the number of stimuli per level decreases to one, the distinction between identifying the latent variable and identifying a particular stimulus ceases to exist. Hence, a primary distinction vanishes between AMA and other more widely known methods for dimensionality reduction. Under these conditions, one should obtain AMA-SGD filters that are similar to PCA filters.</p><p>To illustrate this point, we learned filters multiple times using AMA-SGD where the only difference between each run was the batch size (Fig <ref type="figure">9</ref>). Indeed, we find that when the batch has only one stimulus per level (~19 stimuli/batch), the resultant AMA-SGD filters are highly correlated with PCA filters. When the batch has 30 or more stimuli per level (~570 stimuli/batch), the resultant AMA-SGD filters are highly correlated with the AMA filters that were learned using AMA (Fig 9A <ref type="figure">-9C</ref>). Costs associated with AMA and AMA-SGD filters become identical as well (Fig <ref type="figure">9D</ref>). Thus, users should be wary of using small batch sizes when learning filters via AMA-SGD. (See S3 Fig for more on the distinction between AMA, PCA, and ICA).</p><p>We have not fully explored how many stimuli per level are required in a batch for AMA-SGD to converge to the filters returned by AMA. It most likely depends on the use case. However, for the tasks we have examined, a good rule of thumb is to start with batches having approximately 30 stimuli per latent variable level and to systematically increase the batch size until the learned filters are stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Filter Robustness</head><p>In this section, we examine the robustness of the optimal filters to changes in the prior probability distribution, overall noise power, and cost function. We find that the optimal filters are remarkably stable, suggesting that natural stimulus properties are the primary determinants of the optimal filter shapes.</p><p>The effect of the prior. In a closed system, the prior probability distribution can be experimentally manipulated, and its effects can be empirically determined. Here, we examine how the prior impacts the optimal AMA filters for the task of estimating binocular disparity with natural stimuli. The effects of seven different prior distributions are examined. The first is the flat prior probability distribution in the training set used throughout the paper: 400 natural stimuli at each of nineteen disparity levels from -15 to 15 arcmin <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Of the remaining six priors, three had excess probability mass at zero (zero-disparity priors; Fig 10A ), and three had excess mass at large non-zero disparities(Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10B</ref>). These priors are enforced by randomly culling stimuli in appropriate numbers from each level of the latent variable in the training set (Fig 10A <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10B</ref>).</p><p>In general, the filter shapes are largely robust to substantial variation in the prior probability distribution. The correlations between the filters in F (flat prior) and the filters in C-I are 0.96, 0.98, 0.98, 1.00, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.96, respectively. The priors do have some effect, however. Zero-disparity priors (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10A</ref>) cause the optimal filters to select for somewhat higher spatial frequencies and smaller phase shifts than a flat prior. Priors with excess mass at large non-zero disparities (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10B</ref>) cause the optimal filters to select for somewhat lower spatial frequencies and larger phase shifts. These trends are as expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, the optimal filters in the disparity estimation task are largely robust to the variations in the prior examined here. These results suggest, consistent with intuition, that the task-relevant features of natural (proximal) stimuli are the primary determinants of the optimal stimulus encoders. This result should not come as a surprise. In Bayesian signal detection theory, for example, the primary effect of a prior is to shift the decision boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>This general approach-manipulation of the prior in a closed system-may prove useful for investigations of optimal information processing in other sensory-perceptual tasks. It may also prove useful in evaluating claims in the literature about the constraints priors place on the design of neural systems and the subsequent limits of sensory-perceptual processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> in the presence of natural stimulus variation.</p><p>The effect of noise power. Here, we examine the effect of the overall level of encoding noise power on the optimal receptive field shapes. We considered five noise variances over a range spanning two orders of magnitude. The low noise condition contained 1/10th the original noise variance (α = 0.136; s 2 0 ¼ 0:023), and the high noise variance condition contained 10x the original noise variance ((α = 13.6; s 2 0 ¼ 2:30). To isolate the effect of cut noise variance, the training set and all other parameters were held constant across the conditions.</p><p>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> shows that the optimal filters are largely robust to substantial changes in response noise variance. Specifically, the correlations between the filters in C (original noise variance) and the filters in A-E are 0.99, 0.99, 1.00, 0.98, and 0.90, respectively. The filters are nearly unchanged for a 30-fold change in noise (Fig 11A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">-11D</ref>). Increasing noise variance by a factor of 10, however, starts to break things down (α = 13.6 and s 2 0 ¼ 2:30; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11E</ref>). This result should cut not come as a surprise. From classic ideal observer theory on target detection and discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, a proportional increase in noise will lower overall performance, but in general it will not change the optimal receptive field shapes. Thus, if the filters are learned with noise parameters that are 'in the ballpark' of the noise characteristics of neurons in cortex, the estimated filters should be near optimal for neurons in cortex even if the estimated noise parameters are off by some amount.</p><p>The effect of the cost function. Here, we examine the effect of changing the cost function that is used to learn the optimal receptive fields. To isolate the effect of the cost function, the training set and all other model parameters were identical to those used for the main results in the paper. The only change was to use an L2 norm (squared error) cost function.</p><p>Changing the cost function has a minimal effect on the optimal encoding filters in this task (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>), just as changing the prior and noise power have minimal effects on the optimal encoding filters. The L2 norm cost function yields filters that are most similar (ρ = 0.95) to the L0 norm filters learned with a prior having excess mass at non-zero values. Again, this result should perhaps not be a surprise. Just as changing the cost function from L0 to L2 norm increases the penalty assigned to large errors, increasing the prior probability mass at non-zero values increases the importance of making fewer errors at those latent variable levels.</p><p>It is advantageous that the filters are generally robust to the different factors considered here (i.e. the prior, response noise power, and cost function). It suggests that for biologically plausible noise parameters, natural stimulus properties and the task of interest are the primary determinants of the filters that optimize performance in the task. This result is sensible: the properties of the stimulus should primarily determine the most useful receptive field shapes for extracting task relevant information from the stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA) is a method for task-specific dimensionality reduction that has contributed to the development of ideal observers for particular sensory-perceptual tasks in early-and mid-level vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It returns the encoding filters (receptive fields) that select the most useful information in proximal stimuli for estimating the value of a latent variable relevant for the task. In conjunction with psychophysical experimental techniques and carefully collected databases of natural images and scenes, the method has helped shed light on the fundamental computations that might be performed by the visual system in the service of particular tasks. Unfortunately, the method has a computational cost high enough as to render the method impractical for many purposes. ). These priors correspond to the most extreme prior with a peak at zero, the flat prior, and the most extreme prior with a nadir at zero. B Optimal filters learned with the L2 norm (squared error) cost function and a flat prior. The L2 norm cost function has a subtle but systematic effect on the optimal filters. that is similar to the effect of a prior with excess mass at non-zero values. To improve the compute time, we derived the gradient for AMA and developed a batch stochastic gradient descent routine to increase the rate at which optimal task-specific filters can be learned. This method, AMA-SGD, finds the optimal filters in compute time that is linear, rather than quadratic, in the number of elements in the training set. In the process, we recognized that filters learned with batches with very few stimuli per level of the latent variable tend to be non-representative. AMA-SGD must therefore be used with caution. However, as our empirical demonstrations make clear, the benefits associated with AMA-SGD greatly outweigh its minor drawbacks, and make AMA a more practical tool for research in perception science.</p><p>In what follows, we contrast AMA and AMA-SGD with other methods for dimensionality reduction and neural characterization that provide encodings that are unique only up to a subspace spanned by a set of encoding filters. AMA has the potential to return not only the subspace, but the particular basis elements defining the subspace. This feature of the method is due to the interacting effects of filter correlation and response noise. Scaled additive (e.g. Poisson-like) response noise and non-orthogonal (correlated) receptive fields are widely documented features of neural systems. Many methods for dimensionality reduction and neural characterization are constrained to consider orthogonal filters only <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> [53], and/or have response models that assume encodings that are noiseless or are corrupted by constant additive noise only <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>We find that scaled additive response noise tends to provide an encoding advantage over orthogonal filters with constant additive noise. We conclude by proposing a novel use for AMA. Specifically, we speculate that, if repurposed for the task of obtaining a descriptive model of the feature space driving a neuron's response, AMA may be able to overcome a fundamental limitation of standard subunit models for neural characterization that prevents links from being established between model components and their biophysical analogs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Encoding Fidelity and Uniqueness within a Subspace</head><p>Standard forms of the most popular methods for dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) and statistical characterization (e.g. ICA) do not include a specific model of encoding noise. In such models, any set of receptive fields (i.e. basis elements) spanning the same subspace encode an arbitrary stimulus with equivalent fidelity. In other words, the encoding provided by a given pair of filters within their spanned subspace is not unique. This fact is due to an assumption common to a large class of popular methods for dimensionality reduction: namely, that the filters encode stimuli noiselessly.</p><p>Encoding noise corrupts measurements by real biological or machine vision systems. AMA incorporates an explicit noise model at the level of the encoding filters (Eqs 1a-1d), as do probabilistic extensions to PCA and ICA <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. Encoding noise (i.e. the filter response model) can make the stimulus encoding unique within the subspace that the encoding filters define. Figs S1, 13 and 14 are designed to help develop a geometric intuition for why filter response noise can make the encoding of particular filters within a subspace unique. After building intuition, we discuss the implications of this fact for our understanding of neural coding. We consider three classes of encoding filter response: i) a noiseless response model (α = 0 and s 2 0 ¼ 0, see Eq 1d; S1 Fig) <ref type="figure">ii</ref>) an constant additive response model (α = 0 and s 2 0 &gt; 0; <ref type="bibr">Fig 13)</ref>, and iii) a scaled additive response noise model (α &gt; 0 and s 2 0 &gt; 0); <ref type="bibr">Fig 14)</ref>. We also consider the impact of having orthogonal (i.e. uncorrelated) encoding filters vs. non-orthogonal (i.e. correlated or anti-correlated) encoding filters. We will see that the type of noise (constant additive or scaled additive), filter correlation (i.e. redundancy), and filter orientation in the subspace can interact non-trivially to confer coding advantages.</p><p>Consider two stimuli that are projected into a standard basis spanned by an arbitrary pair of filters f; let this subspace be represented by orthonormal basis e (Figs S1, 13 and 14) If noiseless encoding is assumed (which is of course biologically unrealistic), the stimuli are encoded with equal fidelity no matter the filter correlation (redundancy) or rotation, so long as the filters lie in the same subspace. Specifically, filters F1 and F2 encode the stimulus identically well, regardless of whether the encoding filters are positively correlated, orthogonal, or anti-correlated. Rotating the encoding filters in the subspace also has no impact on coding fidelity. Thus, with no encoding noise, every set of filters spanning the same subspace provides an equivalent stimulus encoding (S1 Fig).</p><p>With constant additive response noise the situation changes. Now, filters F1 and F2 encode the stimulus with different fidelity when they are correlated vs. when they are orthogonal; note the differences in the uncertainty ellipses (Fig 13A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">-13C</ref>). When the filters are orthogonal (Fig 13B <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13E</ref>), the uncertainty ellipses are circular, and stimulus encoding remains invariant to rotation (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13E</ref>). Stimulus encoding by correlated filters, however, is no longer invariant to filter rotation (Fig 13A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">, 13D, 13C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13F</ref>).</p><p>With scaled additive response noise, the situation changes still further. Filters F1 and F2 now provide a unique encoding of the stimulus, regardless of whether they are correlated or uncorrelated, and regardless of whether the filters are rotated or not (Fig 14A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">-14F</ref>). The fact that the fidelity of stimulus encoding changes as a function of filter correlation and rotation within a subspace suggests that encoding cost (i.e. the value of AMA objective function) may depend on the particular filters within a given subspace. To examine this issue quantitatively, we rotated the optimal receptive field pair within their spanned subspace and computed the cost for each rotation angle θ. (see S8 Text). Recall that the optimal filters in the current task are somewhat anti-correlated (r ¼ f T 1 f 2 ¼ À 0:22). We also examined the cost of forcing the filters to be orthogonal. To do so, we performed Gram Schmidt orthogonalization, rotated the orthogonalized filters, and computed the cost for each rotation angle θ.</p><p>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref> shows that some filter pairs within the subspace yield lower cost than others (Fig 15A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">-15C</ref>). Example filter pairs that have been rotated by different amounts are depicted in Fig 15D . With scaled additive response noise (the noise model with which the filters were learned), cost is lowest for the optimal filters. For all non-zero rotation angles cost increases, except for 180˚(Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15A</ref>). (A 180˚rotation angle corresponds to contrast reversal of both receptive fields, which by assumption (Eqs 1a-1d), gives identical performance to the original filters). If the filters are orthogonalized, cost increases on average. More importantly, the minimum cost of the best pair of orthgonalized filters is higher than the minimum cost of the original somewhat anti-correlated filters. This result shows that correlated filters can provide a coding advantage over orthogonal filters in the AMA framework. Next, we examined constant additive response noise models. With constant additive (instead of scaled additive) response noise, cost is also modulated by the rotation angle within the subspace, but only if the filters are non-orthogonal. If the filters are orthogonal, all filter rotations within the subspace provide an identical encoding (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15A</ref>). These results are consistent with the intuitions developed in Fig 13 . To make a quantitative comparison between the encoding costs associated with the two noise models, we matched the noise power between the two models. Specifically, we set the constant additive noise variance equal to the average variance of the scaled additive noise</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">s 2 constant ¼ 1 N X kl s 2 scaled</formula><p>where N is the total number of stimuli in the training set. Encoding filters having this constant additive noise never achieve costs as low as the scaled additve noise model (Fig 15A <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15C</ref>). So long as noise power is matched, this result holds whether the filters are learned with scaled additive or constant additive noise. Therefore, for the task considered here (disparity estimation), scaled additive noise provides a coding advantage. This same result holds for several other fundamental tasks in early vision with natural images (retinal speed estimation, motion-in-depth estimation). These tasks have all been successfully modeled with energy-like computations (disparity energy model, motion energy model, etc.). We conclude that scaled additive noise provides a coding advantage over constant additive noise in an important class of estimation tasks in early-and mid-level vision for which energy-like computations are appropriate.</p><p>There are several take-away points. First, in AMA, all encoding filters, even those spanning the same subspace, do not provide equivalent encodings. Second, correlated filters can yield lower cost encodings than orthogonal filters. Third, scaled additive response noise can yield lower cost encodings than constant additive response noise when the noise power (i.e. average noise variance) is matched. These results have implications for how to think about the pros and cons of the constraints imposed on many methods for dimensionality reduction. A secondary effect is that the height and/or width of the response noise ellipses decrease as the corresponding mean filter response approaches zero. Note, however, that the noise ellipses always remain aligned with the cardinal axes. In other words, the noise ellipses have diagonal covariance matrices, consistent with the assumption of independent response noise. In filter response space, the algorithm's aim is to position the filters such that the conditional response distributions p(R|X i ) are as discriminable from each other as possible.</p><p>With a constant additive noise model, in the standard basis, all uncertainty ellipses have the same orientation (c.f. Fig 13B ); in the filter basis, all noise ellipses are circular (i.e. equal In general, cost is minimized when encoding uncertainty is maximized within, and minimized between, latent-variable-conditioned stimulus distributions. That is, when uncertainty due to noise maximally overlaps the uncertainty due to 'nuisance' stimulus variation, coding of the latent variable is improved. A related claim about the potential utility of noise correlations has recently been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. Additionally, scaled additive noise yields lower response variance for stimuli near the origin than stimuli far from the origin of the response space, thereby reducing the relative cost of 'hard' stimuli and increasing the relative cost of 'easy' stimuli. Each stimulus therefore contributes more evenly to the cost. In the tasks considered, this property causes the algorithm to make better use of the information provided by each stimulus. If the expressions underlying AMA were reformulated as a learning rule, we suspect that scaled additive noise would enable the system to learn more efficiently. Most importantly, we have shown that scaled additive noise and non-orthogonal filters can confer significant benefits to neural encoding. These benefits are obtained when uncertainty due to noise is shaped to match within-level stimulus variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>The AMA cost landscape is non-convex, so there is no guarantee that the filters found by the algorithm indeed represent the global minimum. However, there are several reasons to suspect that the filters for disparity estimation presented here indeed found a global minimum. First, the recovered filters occupy the minimum of the cost landscape within the subspace that they span (Fig 15A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">-15C</ref>). Second, somewhat surprisingly, correlated (non-orthogonal) filters with scaled additive noise tend yield lower cost landscapes with deeper minima (Fig 15B <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15C</ref>) than orthogonal filters with constant additive noise. Third, the work presented here and in previous publications has found that different random initializations tend to yield equivalent filters.</p><p>The response model used here allows both positive and negative encoding filter responses whereas real neurons give only positive responses. Future work will examine the pros and cons of incorporating half-rectification into the response model (Eqs 1a-1d). One drawback of incorporating half-rectification is that more filters will be required to cover the same response space, thereby increasing the dimensionality of the search space, perhaps leading to less stable performance. However, incorporating half-rectification will increase biological realism, allow for differential sensitivity to ON/OFF contrast changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, and increase the flexibility of the system to match stimulus encoding uncertainty to task-irrelevant stimulus variation (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMA for Neural Systems Identification</head><p>Interest in neural systems identification has surged in recent years. The field has generated a slew of models with ever increasing sophistication and descriptive power. Many of these models are known as 'subunit models'. Subunit models seek to provide a computational level description of a neuron's processing that can predict a neuron's response to arbitrary stimuli.</p><p>The spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance (STC) analysis are early examples of subunit models <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. The generalized linear model (GLM) and generalized quadratic model (GQM) are examples of more recently developed subunit models that are more flexible and powerful <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. (All of these methods have been adapted to handle nonspiking, real-valued data (e.g. response rates or intracellular voltages <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>). These methods have been widely adopted by the neuroscience community because of their success in providing compact, interpretable characterizations of the input-output relationship between stimuli and neural response. In general, subunit models describe neural response with a low-dimensional set of stimulus features (i.e. subunit receptive fields), a nonlinear pooling rule, a static output non-linearity, and noise function that generates output noise. As these models have increased in descriptive power and mathematical elegance, interest has increased in whether the computational components can be mapped back to specific biophysical components. For example, in a subunit model description of a complex cell, one may ask whether presynaptic simple cells are the biophysical analogs of the model subunits.</p><p>A limitation of this class of subunit models is that although they can recover the subspace spanned by a set of receptive fields, the models cannot recover the subunit receptive fields themselves. In traditional subunit models, any set of receptive fields spanning the same subspace encodes a given stimulus with equal fidelity. This property of subunit models is due to the fact that they implicitly assume noiseless encoding. AMA, on the other hand, has an explicit model of response noise for each filter (i.e. subunit receptive field). As discussed above, response yields encodings that are unique within the subspace defined by the filters (Figs 15, 16 and S1). By adapting AMA as a method for neural system's identification, we speculate that it may be possible to identify both the subspace spanned by the subunit receptive fields, and the individual subunit receptive fields themselves. As neural datasets come online having simultaneous recordings between 'target cells' and their presynaptic inputs (e.g. connected V1 and LGN units), these possibilities can be tested explicitly.</p><p>Explicitly modeling noise at the level of the subunit receptive field responses does not come without its own set of drawbacks. The GLM and GQM have cost landscapes that are convex; the local minimum is guaranteed to be the global minimum under the model. The cost landscape in AMA is non-convex, so guarantees cannot be made that the minima found via AMA are global minima. However, in the cases we have examined (see above), AMA results tend to be stable. Future work must determine whether this research direction is viable, but the ingredients are there to justify searching for a productive way forward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This manuscript presents technical improvements to and conceptual insights about Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA), a recently developed Bayesian method for task-specific dimensionality reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The manuscript has four primary aims. First, it provides a thorough and intuitive review of AMA, explaining the logic behind method's setup and its solutions. Second, it contributes two technical advances-the gradient of the cost function and a stochastic gradient descent routine-that markedly decrease compute time, thereby making it a more practical tool for research in sensation and perception. Third, it shows that the effects of the prior over the latent variable, internal noise, and the cost function can be examined relative to the effect of stimulus variability. Fourth, it examines several non-standard features of the method-its ability to model scaled additive noise and learn correlated filters-that make it more flexible than other more widely known methods. This flexibility confers a coding advantage, and renders the method capable of identifying particular filters (receptive fields) within the subspace that they span. This capability is due primarily to the explicit modeling of noise at the level of the encoding filter responses, which all biological systems suffer from. Perceptual psychology and visual neuroscience are relatively young fields, but they are advancing rapidly, and cross-pollination between the sub-disciplines is increasingly common. As research with natural stimuli becomes increasingly common, widespread application of this method may help speed progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1. The logic of Accuracy Maximization Analysis. AFactors that determine the optimal non-linear decoder, g(Á). For any particular filter set, the optimal decoder provides a closed form expression for the cost by i) computing the posterior probability over the latent variable p(X|R), and ii) reading out the optimal estimate b X opt from the posterior that minimizes the cost. B AMA begins with a labeled training set. Each individual stimulus in the training set, s ij , must be labeled with a particular value of the latent variable of interest, X i . The labeling of the training set implicitly defines the task. Subsequent steps to finding optimal task-specific filters via AMA are: i) select a particular stimulus s kl from the labeled training set; ii) obtain a noisy filter response R kl from a given (possibly non-optimal) set of initial filters; iii) use the optimal non-linear decoder to obtain the optimal estimate and its expected cost; iv) repeat for each stimulus in the training set and compute the average cost across the training set; v) update the filters to reduce the cost; vi) repeat until the average cost across the training set is minimized. The filters that minimize the cost are the optimal task-specific filters.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,44.16,78.01,531.78,267.76" type="bitmap" /></figure>

A Hypothetical one-dimensional conditional response distributions from a single filter (receptive field). Each distribution represents noisy filter responses to each stimulus in the training set. Blue distributions represent the filter response distributions for the two stimuli having the first latent variable value. Red distributions respresent the response distributions to the two stimuli having the second (i.e. incorrect) value. The striped blue distribution corresponds to the distribution of responses to the current stimulus s kl which, in this case, has the first value of the latent variable. The solid blue circle represents the likelihood that a random observed response R 1 (k,l) was elicited by stimulus s kl the stimulus that actually elicited the response. The open blue circle represents the likelihood that the same response was elicited by stimulus s km , the other stimulus having latent value X k . The sum of these stimulus likelihoods represents the likelihood that the observed response was elicited by a stimulus having latent variable value, X k . The open red circles represent the likelihoods that the observed response resulted from the two stimuli having value X i 6 ¼ k (i.e. from stimuli with the incorrect latent variable value). The posterior probability (Eq 5) of the correct latent variable value (i.e. the latent variable value X k corresponding to stimulus s kl ) is given by the sum of the likelihoods for within-level stimuli normalized by the sum of all likelihoods; the posterior probability distribution for this hypothetical case is shown in the next figure. Confusions between stimuli with the correct latent variable value increase the posterior probability of the correct level by contributing to the numerator (blue-boxed entries in the equation above figure panel). Confusions between correct and incorrect levels decrease the posterior probability of the correct level by contributing to the denominator (red-boxed entries in equation above figure panel).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scaled Additive Neural Noise and Filter Correlation</head><p>In this section, we examine why scaled additive response noise can provide an advantage over constant additive response noise. In early visual areas, neural response variance increases approximately linearly with the mean response <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Much attention has been paid to this property of neural response, especially as it relates psychophysical performance in target detection, a paradigmatic task in the spatial vision literature. When response variance is proportional to the mean response, a single neuron's signal-to-noise ratio for detection of a particular target is proportional to the square-root of the mean response, SNR / ffiffi r p . On the other hand, if neural response variance is independent of the mean response (i.e. constant), the signal to noise ratio is proportional to the mean response, SNR / r. Thus, it has been sensibly argued that, all other things equal, scaled additive noise must have deleterious effects on neural coding compared to constant additive noise.</p><p>However, in the case considered above, scaled additive noise (response noise variance proportional to mean response) outperforms constant additive noise with matched noise powers. Many (most?) visual tasks are performed at super threshold contrasts and involve estimating the value of a variable that is latent in the proximal stimulus. In latent variable estimation and discrimination tasks, scaled additive noise can benefit, rather than deteriorate the quality of neural encoding. This is true in the current task of disparity estimation (Figs 6 and 14-16). It is also true of other related tasks in early vision (e.g. speed estimation and motion-in-depth estimation). This result raises the possibility that a ubiquitous neural response property that hurts performance in contrast detection tasks may actually benefit performance in tasks that are somewhat 'higher-level' (e.g. disparity estimation).</p><p>Why, in latent variable estimation and discrimination, can a vision system with scaled additive noise outperform a vision system with matched constant additive noise? Some development is necessary to answer this question because the answer depends on a set of interlocking dependencies between the noise model, filter correlations, and the latent-variable-conditioned stimulus distributions p(s|X i ). When the task is to discriminate one latent variable value from another (as opposed to detecting a well-defined contrast pattern-a signal-known-exactly task), it is less clear what constitutes 'signal' and what constitutes 'noise'. We have found it useful to approach the problem with standard techniques in the pattern classification literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Consider a hypothetical case that illustrates the relevant principles. Fig 16A <ref type="figure">-16C</ref> shows three simulated stimulus distributions projected into the subspace spanned by a pair of filters. (These simulated distributions are superficially similar to the disparity conditioned stimulus distributions shown in Fig 6C .) These same exact stimuli are encoded by three pairs of filters that are differently correlated, but that have the same scaled additive noise and that span the same subspace (Eqs 1a-1c). This subspace is represented by the orthonormal basis e that spans the same subspace as the filters f. The upper and lower rows of Fig 16A <ref type="figure">-16C</ref> represent the same information in different forms. In the upper row, three latent-variable-conditioned stimulus distributions are projected into the subspace defined by a pair of filters p(e T s|X i ); the dots represent the stimulus projections in the standard basis and the ellipses represent encoding uncertainty. In the lower row, the exact same stimulus projections are represented by the mean responses that they elicit from each filter pair, p(f T s|X i ); the dots represent the stimulus projections onto the filters and the ellipses represent filter response noise. We refer to the lower row as the filter basis. Consistent with the assumption that the filter response noise is independent (Eqs 1c and 1d), all the noise ellipses in the filter basis (lower row) are aligned with the axes of the space (i.e. the noise covariance matrix is diagonal). The linear mappings from the filter basis to the standard basis and back are derived in S8 Text. The oblique </p></div>			</div>
