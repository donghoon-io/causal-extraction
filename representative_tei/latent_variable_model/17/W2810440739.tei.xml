<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>While factorial surveys have been widely used in sociological research since decades (see Wallander 2009 for an overview) other multifactorial survey designs such as stated choice and conjoint experiments are still novel for most sociologists (but see <ref type="bibr">Auspurg and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hinz 2014, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Beyer and Liebe 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Liebe et al. 2016)</ref>. In stated choice experiments respondents are asked to choose from an array of behavioral alternatives, which vary in a number of attributes, the alternative they favor most. This design allows researchers to estimate the effect of each attribute on respondents' stated choices. Stated choice experiments (SCEs) originated in marketing and transportation economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Louviere et al. 2000)</ref> and became popular in many subfields of economics including transportation, health and environmental economics because they provide a means of measuring preferences for product attributes even if the good in question is hypothetical. It is important to stress that SCE are not identical with or a special case of conjoint experiments. The main difference is the theoretical foundation of SCE which is based on random utility theory (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Auspurg and Hinz 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Louviere et al. 2010</ref> for a detailed discussion). This theoretical foundationa rational-choice frameworkis in-principle in line with many sociological action theories assuming that individuals choose from behavioral alternatives the one that gives the highest level of satisfaction or utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kroneberg and Kalter 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bruch and Feinberg 2017)</ref>. Applications of SCE in sociology include studies on the social embeddedness in trust situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Buskens and Weesie 2000)</ref>, ethical consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andorfer and Liebe 2013)</ref> and discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Beyer and Liebe 2015)</ref>. Both, SCE and conjoint experiments are also used in political science research for example regarding the admission of immigrants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hainmueller and Hopkins 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bansak et al. 2016)</ref>, climate agreements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bechtel and Scheve 2013)</ref> and ethnic voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Carlson 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Most studies using SCEs focus on the main effects of choice attributes. However, more recently the relationship between those attributes and further explanatory variables like socio-demographics and attitudinal concepts became a major concern since it is more realistic and theoretically meaningful to assume preference heterogeneity within a given population.</p><p>Theoretically derived explanatory variables like attitudes can be expected to considerably increase the explanatory power of choice models. In principle these variables can be directly included in a choice model. Yet, some authors have questioned this approach because the integration of attitudinal questions as error free explanatory variables in a choice model biases model results <ref type="bibr">(Ben-Akiva et al. 2002a,b)</ref>. These authors argue that it is crucial to account for the fact that attitude measures must be understood as latent indicators of an unobserved "true" (psychic) state. To add attitude measures directly to the models could potentially lead to an endogeneity bias and misrepresentation of causality. Endogeneity bias means that errors of the structural equation of indicators for attitudes might be correlated with the error of the choice model <ref type="bibr">("[...]</ref> unobserved effects that influence both a respondent's choice and his/her responses to indicator questions," <ref type="bibr">Daly et al. 2012: 269)</ref>. Misrepresentation of causality refers to the argument that responses to indicator questions do not necessarily have a causal relationship with behavioral choices.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that, based on an action-theoretic framework, hybrid choice models can be a useful tool to model preference heterogeneity and modification in a population and hence to overcome potential endogeneity bias and causal misrepresentation regarding attitudinal effects. Hybrid choice models extend the specification of the traditional random utility model by incorporating additional decision protocols and enrich the underlying behavioral characterizations. These extensions comprise, among others, flexible disturbances (e.g., factor analytic) to mimic more complex error structures and to allow for the explicit modeling of latent psychological factors such as attitudes. However, the term "hybrid choice model" is an umbrella concept for different choice modeling techniques. In the following we focus on latent class structures to uncover preference heterogeneity and segmentation as well as latent variable approaches to integrate attitudinal effects and to investigate preference modification. We demonstrate that this type of hybrid choice model, an integrated choice and latent variable model, is especially valuable for sociological and other social science research.</p><p>In our empirical application we investigate the relationship between attitudes and choice behavior in a SCE study of ethical and political consumption that was carried out in Germany in 2012 and investigates the preferences for so-called "Peace products"goods that are jointly produced by Israeli and Palestinian producers. Ethical and political consumption research deals with consumer behavior that takes not only a product's quality and price into account, but also the political, social, and environmental effects of its production and marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Stolle et al. 2005, Andorfer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Liebe 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Friedman (1996)</ref> distinguishes between "boycotts", or negative buying behavior, and "buycotts", or positive buying behavior. Boycotting denotes refusal to buy products and services that are associated with negative political, social, and environmental (i.e. external) effects. Buycotting refers to the deliberate purchase of products that are perceived to reduce negative or generate positive external effects. Organic production is another ethical product characteristic considered in our study; organic crops are grown without pesticides and herbicides and are therefore associated with environmental and human health benefits compared with conventionally produced crops.</p><p>In our study respondents had to evaluate different types of olive oils which varied regarding production method (organic, non-organic), origin (Italy, Israel, Palestinian Territories, and jointly produced by Israeli and Palestinian producers, so called "Peace Products") and price.</p><p>Theoretical determinants explaining the purchase of products with ethical attributes include pure altruism, impure altruism or warm glow giving, social and personal norms, trust, and object related attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Stolle et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Liebe 2014</ref>). In our case we concentrate specifically on relevant discriminatory attitudes towards Jews, Arabs as well as attitudes towards the Israel-Palestinian conflict, all of them can be expected to affect stated preferences for products from Israel, Palestinian territories and Peace products.</p><p>In the following we discuss how the hybrid choice modeling framework relates to economic and sociological theory. This is followed by a presentation of our stated choice experiment, a description of the results and a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid choice modeling as a method to uncover processes of decision making which are closely linked to action theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Interplay of Attitudes, Preferences and Choice Behavior</head><p>We discuss the relationship between attitudes, preferences and choice behavior (decision making) within the hybrid choice modeling framework as pictured in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The standard explanatory chain in social science research holds that attitudes affect preferences which in turn affect behavior. However, what makes behavioral research difficult is the fact that attitudes and preferences are theoretical, latent constructs that cannot be directly observed by researchers. This has consequences for the adequate modeling of decision and action theories in sociology and other social sciences. We therefore first introduce the basic theoretical idea behind the SCE method as it was developed in economic research. Second, we discuss one specific approach for capturing preference heterogeneity in a population (i.e. not all individuals have the same "tastes"), an assumption that is very plausible in most behavioral studies. Third, we specify how attitudes can be linked to preferences and choice behavior by taking into account that they are latent variables. It has to be stressed that in what follows, theory and statistical modeling are discussed hand in hand because the statistical models are used to represent the theoretical arguments. This is one strength of choice modeling compared to other modeling approaches for testing theories in social science research such as including theory-oriented variables in a regression model without taking the underlying behavior model or assumptions into account. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory-guided Mapping of Preferences</head><p>Many theoretical explanations of sociological phenomena rest on the idea that behavioral choices are associated with outcomes that can be expressed in terms of utility or satisfaction for the decision maker <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Voss and Abraham 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kroneberg and Kalter 2012)</ref>. For example, occupational choice is related to monetary characteristics such as income and non-monetary characteristics such as flexible hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Boskin 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bender et al. 2005)</ref>. Explicitly or implicitly, many researchers assume that choosing an occupation depends on a (linear) combination of these relevant characteristics and that individuals choose the behavioral alternative with the highest utility or level of satisfaction (or employ another decision rule). Such theory building (also Opp 1999) can be found with regard to political participation, migration, environmental behavior, deviant behavior etc. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hechter and Kanazawa 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kroneberg and Kalter 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wittek et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tutić and Liebe 2017)</ref>. In empirical studies researchers try to disentangle the effects/importance (e.g., utility weights) of each of these characteristics. While these sociological theories are often not defined well in a formal manner within (sociological) rational choice theory (i.e. wide variants of RCT, Opp 1999; Tutić and Liebe 2017 for a critical discussion), they are fairly close to ideas developed in economic choice theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McFadden 1986</ref>) that underlies the stated-choice-experiment (SCE) method. The starting point is " <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> the economists' standard model of the choice process, a theory of rational choice in which individuals collect information on alternatives, use the rules of probability to convert this information into perceived attributes, and then go through a cognitive process that can be represented as aggregating the perceived attribute levels into a stable one-dimensional utility index which is then maximized" <ref type="bibr">(McFadden 2001: 336)</ref>.</p><p>SCEs are motivated by the consideration that the effects of the characteristics or attributes of a good can be separated <ref type="bibr">(Louviere et al. 2000: 2)</ref>, an idea, which was explicitly developed for example in <ref type="bibr">Lancaster's (1966: 133)</ref> characteristics theory of value: "The chief technical novelty lies in breaking away from the traditional approach that goods are the direct objects of utility and, instead, supposing that it is the properties or characteristics of the goods from which utility is derived." Assuming a decision rule, most often utility maximizing behavior, SCE can be used to map preferences and hence to investigate the relevance and importance weights that individuals place on the characteristics of a good or behavioral alternative. SCEs thereby can be used to test parts of sociological action theories, for example regarding the relevance of theoretical variables for behavioral outcomes and models of rational choice. In principle, other decision rules including loss aversion and elimination by aspects can also be tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chorus 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Originally, in the standard model of the choice process sociological and social-psychological behavioral determinants such as beliefs, attitudes and perceived social norms were typically not considered. This led to the formulation of the random utility maximization model (RUM) which followed a basic idea that <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Thurstone (1927)</ref> had introduced in a paper on comparative judgment, now accounting for "errors in perception" <ref type="bibr">(McFadden 1986: 279;</ref><ref type="bibr">2001)</ref>. Among others, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McFadden (1974)</ref> developed models to introduce randomness in the utility maximization model in order to being able to consider "psychophysical" phenomena such as attitudes. His multinomial/conditional logit model is the baseline for analyzing stated choice/preference data in line with (economic) choice theory and is described by a set of structural equations, represented by the utilities of alternative 𝑗 for respondent 𝑛 in the choice occasion 𝑡 as: The baseline theory and corresponding model is represented by the box with dashed lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The decision process itself is a black box or theoretical/latent variable for researchers (ovals in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) but preferences for behavioral attributes and choice behavior can be observed in the field or in experiments such as stated preference experiments. Other non-observable characteristics of decision making are attributed to the error term (the "randomness" part).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑈 𝑛𝑗𝑡 = 𝑉 𝑛𝑗𝑡 + 𝜀 𝑛𝑗𝑡 = 𝐴𝑆𝐶 𝑗 + 𝛽 ′ 𝑥 𝑛𝑗𝑡 + 𝜀 𝑛𝑗𝑡 ,<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory-guided Mapping of Preference Segmentation</head><p>The baseline theory and model rely on the assumption that a population can be represented by one preference parameter for each choice attribute considered in the analysis. The analysis does not take into account that individuals might differ in their preferences. However, this is often unrealistic. In the following we modify the standard theoretical model by including latent segmentation (latent classes) in a population. This is especially useful in sociological applications where researchers often expect distinct groups in society to differ in their preferences and characteristics (occupational preferences, ethnic preferences, political preferences, etc.). While the latent segmentation approach seems rather exploratory at first sight, it can also be used to capture groups of individuals and model their characteristics as theoretically derived determinants of class membership. Another benefit of the approach lies in its ability to estimate group sizes. This gives an idea about how large groups with different behavioral preferences in a population are. .</p><p>(3)</p><p>The class allocation probabilities 𝜋 𝑛,𝑐 𝑠 are usually modelled by using a logit structure, where the utility of a class is a function of a constant and socio-demographic variables. .</p><p>(4)</p><p>For one of the classes, the parameters for the constant 𝜇 0,𝑠 and socio-demographic variables (𝜑 1𝑠 ,𝜑 2𝑠 , … , 𝜑 𝑚𝑠 ) are fixed to zero for the purpose of normalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linking Attitudes and Preference Segmentation/Modification</head><p>To integrate attitudinal measures in SCE for capturing preference modification and for testing assumptions in sociological and social-psychological theories such as the attitude-behavior relationship (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bohner and Dickel 2011)</ref>, the most obvious thing to do might be the inclusion of interaction terms between attitudinal items and choice attributes in the standard model or, for example, in the membership function of a LCCM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ojea and Loureiro, 2007)</ref>. However, from a theoretical point of view this is problematic because sociological and psychological concepts such as attitudes are latent constructs and thus comprised of an observable and unobservable part. Endogeneity bias and misrepresentation of causality are the two main reasons discussed in the literature for using a latent variable approach to capture attitudinal effects <ref type="bibr">(Ben-Akiva et al. 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vij and Walker 2016</ref> for a discussion).</p><p>Endogeneity bias refers to correlations between indicators for attitudes and the error of the choice model. .</p><p>(5)</p><p>For one of the classes, the parameters for the constant 𝜇 0,𝑠 , the latent variables (𝜆 1𝑠 , 𝜆 2𝑠 ), and the socio-demographic variables (𝜑 1𝑠 , 𝜑 2𝑠 , … , 𝜑 𝑚𝑠 ) are fixed to zero for the purpose of normalization.</p><p>The next part of such a hybrid model is formed by measurement equations relating the ordinal responses to the attitudinal items to the latent variables. The ℓ th indicator of all 𝐿 𝑞 indicators for respondent 𝑛 is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝐼 𝑞ℓ𝑛 = 𝑚(𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 , 𝜁 𝑞 ) + 𝑣 𝑞𝑛 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the indicator 𝐼 𝑞ℓ𝑛 is a function of latent variables 𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 and a vector of parameters 𝜁 𝑞 . The specification of 𝑣 𝑞𝑛 determines the behavior of the measurement model and depends on the nature of the indicator. In some studies the distribution of the indicator was approximated by a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Glerum, Atasoy and Bierlaire, 2014)</ref> and therefore the error 𝑣 𝑞𝑛 was assumed to be normal. In other studies, as also in the present one, the discrete nature of the indicator leads to the use of models for ordinal outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Daly et al. 2012)</ref>. Given an ordinal response scale, the measurement equations base on threshold functions. For a discrete indicator with 5 levels 𝑖 1 , 𝑖 2 , … , 𝑖 5 such that 𝑖 1 &lt; 𝑖 2 &lt; ⋯ &lt; 𝑖 5 the measurement equation for individual</p><p>𝑛 is modelled as an ordered logit model for the latent variable as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐼 𝑞ℓ𝑛 = { 𝑖 1 𝑖𝑓 -∞ &lt; 𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 ≤ 𝜏 𝑞ℓ1 𝑖 2 𝑖𝑓 𝜏 𝑞ℓ1 &lt; 𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 ≤ 𝜏 𝑞ℓ2 ⋮ 𝑖 5 𝑖𝑓 𝜏 𝑞ℓ4 &lt; 𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 &lt; ∞ . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where 𝜏 𝑞ℓ𝑘 are thresholds that need to be estimated.</p><p>The last part of our hybrid model is formed by the second set of structural equations relating the latent variables to the individual characteristics. That is for the 𝑞-th latent variable of total 𝑄 defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 = 𝛾 𝑞1 𝑍 1𝑛 + 𝛾 𝑞2 𝑍 2𝑛 + ⋯ + 𝛾 𝑞𝑚 𝑍 𝑚𝑛 + 𝜔 𝑞𝑛 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where 𝑍 1𝑛 , 𝑍 2𝑛 , … , 𝑍 𝑚𝑛 are socio-demographic variables and 𝜔 𝑞𝑛 are random disturbances that are assumed to be normally distributed with a zero mean and standard deviation 𝜎 𝑞𝜔 .</p><p>The model is estimated by maximum simulated likelihood. The estimation involves maximizing the joint likelihood of the observed sequence of choices (𝑃 𝑛 ) defined in (3) and the observed answers to the attitudinal questions 𝐿 𝐼 𝑞ℓ𝑛 , where 𝐿 𝐼 𝑞ℓ𝑛 corresponds to the usual loglikelihood function of an ordered logit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Long 1997)</ref>. The two components are conditional on the given realization of the latent variable 𝐿𝑉 𝑞𝑛 . Accordingly, the log-likelihood function of the model is given by integration over 𝜔 𝑞𝑛 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝐿𝐿(𝛽, 𝜇, 𝛾, 𝜁, 𝜏) = ∑ 𝑙𝑛 𝑁 𝑛=1 ∫ (𝑃 𝑛 ∏ ∏ 𝐿 𝐼 𝑞ℓ𝑛 𝑄 𝑞=1 ) 𝐿 𝑞 ℓ=1 𝜔 𝑔(𝜔)𝑑.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Thus, the joint likelihood function ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>) depends on parameters of the utility functions defined in</p><p>(3), the parameters used in the allocation probabilities (5), the parameters for the sociodemographic interactions in the latent variable specification defined in (8), and the parameters for the measurement equations defined in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">7</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Daly et al. (2012)</ref> describe different identification procedures. In this application, we follow the Bolduc normalization by setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ ω = 1.</formula><p>To summarize, our application of a hybrid choice model is not only in line with economic or consumer theoryimplying e.g. common price and income effectsbut can also accommodate sociologically relevant concepts such as beliefs, subjective norms, and attitudes, the latter being usually explicitly modeled based on a latent variable model. In other words: hybrid choice models account for the finding that "demographic, economic, and social variables can modify preferences" <ref type="bibr">(McFadden 1987: 278)</ref>. In this respect it is also a powerful tool for sociological and other social science research because in line with many action-theoretic models in sociology and other social sciences stated choice experiments combined with the random utility model and latent class and latent variable modelling can uncover the relevance of behavioral characteristics as well as theoretical determinants of preference modification such as beliefs and attitudes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental design</head><p>In our stated choice experiment (SCE) study respondents were shown choice sets with three different extra virgin olive oil alternatives and were asked to state which one of these olive oils they would buy. There was also a "none of those" option. The latter was included to map a realistic shopping situation in a supermarket as closely as possible. Each olive oil was characterized by a combination of attribute levels referring to organic production (yes, no), origin (Israel, Palestinian Territories, Peace Product, Italy), and price (3, 6,10,15 Euro).</p><p>Respondents were told that all of the olive oils are extra virgin (the highest quality) and packaged in ½-litre bottles. The Peace products were explained in the survey by means of the following text: "The examples of food products that you will see below vary in price, production methods and country of origin. A special characteristic is that some of these examples are of so-called Peace Products, which are the result of joint projects that are designed to foster cooperation between farmers from Israel and from the Palestinian Territories. The Palestinian and the Israeli partners in these projects benefit equally from the sales of these Peace Products.</p><p>The income generated from the sale of these products is used to promote joint Israeli-Palestinian social projects."</p><p>Since the full factorial of all attribute-level combinations (three alternatives with three attributes of two, four, and four levels, respectively) is very large, we worked with a fractional factorial design. Specifically, using the software Ngene (2018), we employed an optimal orthogonal in the differences (OOD) design (see <ref type="bibr">Burgess and Street 2005)</ref>. Orthogonality ensures that the influence of a single attribute can be determined independently from the influences of the others. Besides orthogonality, the choice design was constructed to minimize the overlap between attribute levels across alternatives in a choice set, thus forcing respondents to make trade-offs between the single attributes. We obtained 20 choice sets which were blocked into four groups of five sets each, and each respondent answered one such group. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> gives an example of the choice sets employed in the survey. Each respondent was asked to picture him/herself in front of a supermarket shelf to select the product that he/she would choose. The experimental design also included a test of context effects; respondents were randomly assigned to one of two groups in the web survey. The first group had to answer questions measuring anti-Arabic and anti-Semitic attitudes before the CE. In the second group these questions were posed after the CE. Apart from this variation, all other aspects of the CE and the attitudinal items were identical in both groups. In this study we focus on the theory-guided modeling of the relationship between attitudes, preference and choice behavior and not the order effect (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Liebe et al. 2016</ref> for a more detailed analysis of the order effect present in this data and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S2</ref> in the supplementary material for a HLCCM taken the order effect and attitudes as latent variables into account; the findings on preference modification are largely similar to the ones presented below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data and variables</head><p>The data were collected via a web-survey in Germany which was carried out by a survey organization in 2012 (quota-controlled sample regarding gender and age). All respondents were members of the organization's access panel which is based on self-selection. Respondents received a small reimbursement from the survey organization for participating. 3,876 panel members were invited to take part in the survey. Of those invited, 652 finished the survey. This amounts to a response rate of 17%, taking all types of dropouts including "closed quota" into account. We obtained 440 usable interviews containing no missing values on the variables that are important for this study. In the sample, 53% are women. Mean age is 42 years (SD = 13.26, Min = 18, Max = 77) and 43% of the respondents have higher education (at least upper secondary education).</p><p>The questionnaire contained several statements, which were answered on a five-point response scale, to measure anti-Semitic and anti-Arab attitudes that were assumed to have a major impact on respondents' decisions to buy products from the Middle East. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> gives an overview of the items we used to measure those concepts. The underlying approach of attitudes refers to <ref type="bibr">Eagly and Chaiken's (1993, 1)</ref> notion of a "psychological tendency" that is expressed by the evaluations of an object, in this case the devaluating of persons perceived as "Jewish" and "Arab," respectively. Anti-Semitic and anti-Arab attitudes refer to ethnical essentialistic devaluations of what is perceived to be a homogenous group, that of "Jews" or "Arabs." In order to control for acquiescence effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lentz 1938;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Peabody 1966)</ref>, that is, the tendency to agree with survey statements in situations of uncertainty, each construct was operationalized using two benevolent and two hostile items. For anti-Semitism the two hostile statements refer to classical stereotypes, namely deceitfulness (item 2) and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories (item 3). In contrast, items 1 and 4 entail favorable statements of Jews, the rejection of which is assumed to indicate prejudiced beliefs. Analogous to anti-Semitism, attitudes towards the group of "Arabs" are measured using two items with hostile (items 1 and 3) and two items with benevolent phrasing (items 2 and 4). The answers to these items and corresponding additive indices of anti-Semitism and anti-Arabism are very similar between treatments.</p><p>Anti-Semitism can be considered to be one of the most socially undesirable topics in Germany.</p><p>In such an environment, where norms of anti-anti-Semitism are perceived to be publicly enforced, we observe the tendency to "camouflage" (see Holz 2001) direct anti-Semitism and use ways of "detour communication" <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann and</ref><ref type="bibr">Erb 1986, 1991)</ref>, the most important one being "Israel-related anti-Semitism" (or: "anti-Zionism"; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Klug 2003)</ref>.

The items reflect previous findings (see <ref type="bibr">Judaken 2007)</ref> showing that Israel-related anti-Semitism on the one hand tries to justify negative attitudes towards Jews by blaming Israel's politics (item 5) and on the other hand denies Israel its right to defend itself (item 6). Finally, it compares Israel's politics to those of the Third Reich by using vocabulary like "extermination" (item 7). Palestine-related anti-Arabism Israel-related anti-Semitism 5.

Disagreement (disagree, strongly disagree) with positively connoted items ranges between 7% and 31% and agreement (agree, strongly agree) with negatively connoted items between 7% and 29%.</p><p>To a lesser degree, but still, anti-Arabic attitudes are affected by anti-discrimination norms as well. Consequently and in line with the approach we applied for the measure of anti-Semitism, we used three items to collect data on "Palestine-related anti-Arabism" (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>). The basic idea again is that statements articulating an outright denial of the rights of Palestinians as well as a stereotypical characterization of Palestinians as being generally violent are used as a more legitimate way to articulate direct anti-Arabism.</p><p>In the following, using a step-by-step approach, we first present the baseline model assuming no preference heterogeneity in the data.

We also see that the price effect varies across classes. With respect to preference segmentation related to ethical and political consumption, the three latent classes can be described as follows:</p><p>Class 1 (no ethical consumption): Respondents who are assigned with the highest probability to this class value products from Israel and the Palestinian territories as well as the Peace product significantly more negatively than products from Italy. They do not value organic products significantly differently compared to non-organic products. Overall, this class tends to have no taste for ethical consumption. The estimated class size is 18%.</p><p>Class 2 (weak ethical consumption): Respondents who are likely to be members of this class with an estimated size of 45% significantly and slightly disvalue products from Israel compared to products from Italy. They neither show statistically significant differences in the valuation of products from Palestinian territories and products from Italy nor regarding the Peace product and products from Italy.

Higher educated individuals are more likely to be assigned to the class with strong ethical preferences compared to the class with no ethical preferences. The education and age effects are in line with studies on ethical and political consumption (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Roessel and Schenk 2017)</ref>, although some studies found only mixed evidence regarding the age of (political) consumers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Starr 2009</ref>).</p><p>Compared with the three class model, we obtain the same substantial results in a four class model where we find another class with no taste for ethical consumption and additionally no significant price sensitivity (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S1</ref>, suppl. material). Higher educated individuals are more likely to be a member of this fourth class compared with the first class with no ethical</p><p>preferences. Yet, this reference class reveals much stronger negative preferences for products from Israel and the Palestinian territories and as well as for the Peace product. Therefore, the overall conclusion derived from the three class model is consistent with the findings of the fourclass model: higher educated individuals are more likely to be members of the "ethical consumption" classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference Segmentation Taking Attitudinal Effects into Account</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> shows Basically, this model shows the same results as the LCCM on preference segmentation presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>. There is a class with no ethical consumption (estimated size of 11%), one with weak ethical consumption (size of 25%) and another with a strong ethical consumption pattern (size of 64%). Also, age and education have the same effects in terms of direction and statistical significance as the model without attitudes.</p><p>In order to test the attitude-behavior relationship we have to focus now especially on class differences regarding the origin of the products. Class 1 (no ethical consumption) seems very peculiar in this regard since individuals belonging to this group generally disvalue products from the Middle East including the Peace product. We now assume that this preference structure is based on respective attitudes, that is, anti-Semitic and anti-Arab prejudices. Thus, there should be a positive effect of the respective attitudinal indices. What we see in This is in line with the literature of the filed. The topic of boycotting Israeli products has made it into the news recently with the case of the BDS movement (BDS standing for "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions") which has been controversially discussed as being potentially anti-Semitic because it demands a general boycott of Israeli goods and even citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Nelson and Brahm 2014)</ref>. Our research now shows that indeed, as some scholars already demonstrated using qualitative data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hirsh 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wistrich 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Herf 2013)</ref>, the boycott of Israeli goods and even of Peace products can be related to anti-Semitic motives.</p><p>There are no studies yet on anti-Arab boycotts and, even more surprisingly, only a small amount of literature that deals with the relationship of Xenophobia and political consumption. But the few studies that exist indicate that prejudiced attitudes can indeed become the basis of consumption preferences and respective behavior (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Harun and Shah 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Shah and Ibrahim 2016)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berndt et al., 1974)</ref> as described in <ref type="bibr">Bierlaire (2009: 65)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key findings on LVs and sociodemographic variables</head><p>Compared with Class 1 (strong discrimination / no ethical consumption) higher values on the latent variable anti-Semitism statistically significantly decrease the likelihood to be allocated to Class 2 (weak discrimination / weak ethical consumption). Therefore, the latent variable "anti-Semitic attitudes" suggests that individuals with negative attitudes towards Jews and Israel are more likely to be members of the class with the lower probability to choose products from Israel (i.e. Class 1). The latent variable anti-Arabism does not affect the allocation probability of Class 2. Further, compared with Class 1 higher values on both LVs (anti-Semitic attitudes and anti-Arab attitudes) significantly decrease the likelihood to be allocated to Class 3 (no discrimination / strong ethical consumption), the class which compared to Class 1 shows smaller effects of the variables "Israel" and "Palestine."</p><p>Thus, there emerges the general pattern that higher values on the latent variables correspond with stronger negative preferences for products from Israel and Palestinian territories as well as the Peace product. As already indicated before and now backed up by a correctly specified statistical model, negative attitudes and respective stated behavioral preferences show a robust correlation.</p><p>Regarding socio-demographics we found similar to the LCCM that women are less likely to be members of Class 2 (weak discrimination / weak ethical consumption) and Class 3 (no discrimination / strong ethical consumption), higher educated respondents are more likely to be assigned to Class 3 and older respondents are less likely to be assigned to both Class 2 and Class 3. The corresponding effects are (weakly) statistically significant. The negative effect for women might be present because the purchase of Peace Products as a type of political consumption is strongly related to political conflicts and previous research found a tendency that women, on average, seem to show lower rates of political interest than men (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Verba et al. 1997</ref>) and that women are less active regarding political participation than men (see Roessel and Schenk 2017: 5). Yet, there is no comparable research specifically concerning the Peace product as an ethical product because this is a novel aspect of our study. Studies on other topics such as the purchase of Fair Trade products, however, show that women, on average, have stronger preferences for political consumption than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Roessel and Schenk 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Another way of quantifying and presenting differences in preferences is to calculate marginal rates of substitution between choice attributes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Holmes et al. 2017)</ref>    Stated choice experiments (SCEs) have already been applied in various areas of the social sciences. While we think that they are a promising approach that should be used more often, it is crucial to correctly specify the models especially if preference heterogeneity can be assumed. SCEs, based on a theoretical framework and behavioral assumptions such as utility maximization, can single out the effect of specific behavioral attributes such as the importance of a product's characteristics that are related to ethical considerations (i.e. the mode and origin of its manufacturing). However, individuals typically differ regarding their preferences. Hence, often a modeling framework fitting all individuals with just a single parameter is based on unrealistic assumptions. Fortunately, it is one of the benefits of SCEs that they are able to capture preference heterogeneity by integrating explanatory measures, especially attitudinal ones. It is common in sociology and social psychology to assume at least a substantial correlation between attitudes and behavioral preferences. In our case, for example, we tried to answer the question if individuals with prejudices (i.e. negative attitudes) are indeed more likely to "boycott" products from respective countries. SCEs offer an opportunity to study such attitude effects on preference formation/modification.</p><p>However, as has been shown in this study, modeling attitude-preference-behavior relationships in a theoretically appropriate way is a rather complex task because attitudes are latent variables. This is the main motivation for using hybrid choice models which can take into account the latent variable nature of attitudes and other concepts such as normative beliefs. In a step-bystep approach and theory-guided manner we have shown how, based on SCE data, preferences can be mapped, preference segmentation can be studied and explained, and how attitudinal effects on preference modification can be captured. In doing so we assumed (random) utility maximizing behavior which is a widespread implicit or explicit assumption, also in sociological applications of Rational Choice Theory (even if the assumption is criticized, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hechter and Kanazawa 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Voss and Abraham 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kroneberg and Kalter 2012</ref>).</p><p>Yet, hybrid choice models are a flexible tool to model different decision rules including random utility maximization, random regret minimization, elimination-by-aspects as well as combinations of decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chorus 2014</ref> for an overview). This opens up the possibility of systematically studying and comparing decision making processes in a controlled experimental environment. This great potential for sociological research should be explored in future studies.</p><p>Our study has exemplified how decision-making processes and assumption of behavioral theories in the social sciences can be modeled more directly using SCE. Therefore, the method complements other methods such as "standard" survey research and insights from laboratory and field experiments regarding individual decision making. Potential areas of applications of SCE are manifold and include educational decision making, migrating, voting, discrimination, and bureaucracy.</p><p>Taking results from the vast number of SCE studies from transportation research, health economics, environmental economics and marketing into account, it seems obvious that also research in sociology and other social sciences has to deal with questions of preference heterogeneity and modification. However, given the high estimation costs of hybrid latent class choice modelsin our case the model included 112 parametersit seems reasonable to ask whether it is really worth the effort. The answer to this question given in the literature is not straightforward <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Mariel and Meyerhoff 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vij and Walker 2016)</ref>. For example, it is shown and argued (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vij and Walker 2016</ref>) that under certain conditions a LCCM without latent variables can capture non-biased estimates and is in line with assumptions about causality.</p><p>Further, sociological concepts such as values, general attitudes, and social norms, which, depending on the context, can be assumed to be very stable over time, create less need for a complex modeling approach because endogeneity bias should be rather low or non-existent.</p><p>Also, if in applied research the interest is to investigate whether there is a "significant relationship" between general attitudes and (choice) behavior, a model without latent variables might be sufficient, even if it is biased to some extent. This is demonstrated in our study with the LCCM including attitudes as explanatory variables in the membership function. Both, the model with and without latent variables show that there is a systematic and statistically significant relationship between discriminatory attitudes and behavior. Yet, the estimated class sizes differ remarkable between the models and it can be assumed that, in our case, the more complex model (HLCCM) represents the population better than the less complex model (LCCM). Further, especially if specific attitudes are of interest, it has to be kept in mind that reverse causality is possible. This has been shown in the context of stated choice experiments, for example, in a study on travel mode choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kroesen et al. 2017)</ref> where there is evidence that behavior influences attitudes more than vice versa. But reverse causality is better captured in a more comprehensive modeling framework taking the causal structure explicitly into account.</p><p>Again, SCEs provide an experimental environment to study such effects of reverse causality which might also be relevant in sociological and other social science applications.</p><p>Despite valuable reasons for employing less complex models to test theoretical relationships in SCE data, there will always remain a clear advantage of the complex model: "Unlike simpler choice models, ICLV [Integrated Choice and Latent Variables] models provide a mathematical framework for testing and applying complex theories of behavior, and lend structure and meaning to underlying sources of heterogeneity" <ref type="bibr">(Vij and Walker 2016: 212)</ref>. Since the theoretically guided explanations of heterogeneity in attitudes, preferences and behavioral choices are at the core of social research in sociology, political science and other social sciences, we think that the approach presented in this paper is a useful complement to the researcher's toolbox.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Hybrid Choice Model of Decision Making (simplified, adapted from Walker and Ben-Akiva 2001; Ben-Akiva et al. 2002a)</figDesc></figure>

If one of the choice attributes includes costs, i.e. a price, marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) values can be calculated by dividing the coefficient value of the non-monetary attribute by the coefficient value of the monetary attribute and multiplying this quotient by minus one [e.g. for the Peace We use this approach to compare preferences across latent classes. Table7presents simulated MWTP values based on results of the HLCCM (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mariel et al. 2015</ref> for details on how to calculate these values). We find, for example, for Class 1 (strong discrimination / no ethical consumption) a MWTP of -8.63 Euro for the Peace product compared to a product from Italy and -1.05 Euro for organic products compared to non-organic</figDesc><table><row><cell>product -1 × (𝛽 𝑃𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑐 𝑠</cell><cell>/𝛽 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐 𝑠</cell><cell>)].</cell></row></table><note><p>products. These values amount to 2.90 Euro and 2.33 Euro, respectively, for Class 3 (no discrimination / strong ethical consumption). Accordingly, due to a positive likelihood to be a member of Class 3, higher educated individuals are more likely to have a positive willingness to pay for Peace products and organic products than less educated individuals.</p></note></figure>
