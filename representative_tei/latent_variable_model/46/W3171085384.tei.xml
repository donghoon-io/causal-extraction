<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When clustering the nodes of a graph, a unique partition of the nodes is usually built, either the graph is undirected or directed. While this choice is pertinent for undirected graphs, it should be discussed for directed graphs because it implies that no difference is made between the clusters of source and target nodes. We examine this question in the context of probabilistic models with latent variables and compare the use of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and of the Latent Block Model (LBM).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Graphs are powerful tools to model complex phenomena arising with structured network data as they take into account the interactions between individuals or entities: the network is defined as a graph whose nodes (or vertices) are the individuals and edges represent the links between the individuals. The origin of graph theory dates back to Euler's solution of the Königsberg's bridges in 1736 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Euler, 1741)</ref>. Graphs have been continuously studied since <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bollobás, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bollobás, , 2013) )</ref> as well as their use in applications arising in many fields such as social science (detection of social or scientific communities), biology (protein-protein interactions, genes networks), ecology (pollination network, food webs), telecommunication (cell phone calls networks) or transport (rental bike sharing stations network).</p><p>Graphs can be regular such as lattices, but with data coming from the real life, a natural way is to model the presence of an edge according to a random process, leading to random graphs. The archetype of random graph was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Erdős and Rényi (1960)</ref> where the probability of having an edge between a pair of vertices is equal for all possible pairs. The availability of large network data drives the development of models and algorithms to handle random graphs, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kolaczyk (2009)</ref> for an introduction to graph tools, modelling and inference.</p><p>Clustering is of major importance in unsupervised learning as it aims to group observations or individuals that are similar inside a group and dissimilar between groups. The stochastic behaviour of nodes in a network is usually heterogeneous, and clustering a graph, i.e. partitioning its nodes into classes sharing the same connection behaviours, is of great interest to describe the graph heterogeneity, as it sums up the network through groups with different behaviours. For example in community detection, one wants to find groups of people that are highly connected between them, and less connected to people from other groups, such as for internet web communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Flake et al., 2002)</ref>. There are many other applications in molecular biology (to study protein coregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Airoldi et al., 2005)</ref> and gene co-expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vasseur, 2017)</ref>), ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Girvan and Newman, 2002)</ref> or transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Etienne and Latifa, 2014)</ref>. This field is very active, as can be seen from the flourishing number of surveys to provide updated overviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fortunato, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goldenberg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Matias and Robin, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abbe, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Leger et al. (2014)</ref> introduces the difference between community detection where nodes are highly connected inside the clusters and less connected between clusters from structurally homogeneous subsets detection, where nodes of a cluster share a similar interaction profile. This latter definition is more general and includes the case of community detection.</p><p>Graphs can also connect two different sets of nodes that can be very different: for example, interactions between customers and products to study the purchase relationship. The objective is to segment the clients simultaneously with the products, helping to set up an efficient recommendation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Reddy et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bennett and Lanning, 2007)</ref>. Such graphs are called bipartite, and the simultaneous clustering of the two sets is called co-clustering. Note that it is sometimes named biclustering, although this denomination can also refer to the search of a subset of nodes having a common behavior, rather than a partition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Madeira and Oliveira, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brault and Lomet, 2015)</ref>. Bipartite graph coclustering is used in many other applications such as text mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dhillon, 2001)</ref>, ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vacher et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Thébault and Fontaine, 2010)</ref> or marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shan and Banerjee, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>A graph is directed when the direction of the interaction between two nodes matters, i.e. when the edges i → j and j → i between nodes i and j are different, undirected otherwise. The clustering of directed graphs is adapted from the clustering of undirected graphs to take into account the direction of the connection and provide a partition of the nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mariadassou et al., 2010)</ref>. However, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Celeux and Vasseur (2018)</ref>, nodes of a directed graph intrinsically own different roles (source or emitter nodes in one hand, target or receiver nodes in another hand) and an interesting question is whether source and target nodes should be similarly clustered.</p><p>For example, the corpus of emails exchanged by employees within a corporation, such as in the Enron email dataset 1 , defines a directed graph on the employees. Its clustering provides a unique partition of the employees according to their connection profiles. However, as the direction of the sending matters, one could find more appropriate to define two partitions, one to reflect the emission behavior, the other to reflect the reception behavior: hence, to perform a co-clustering of the bipartite graph where each employee belongs to two distinct sets, that of emitters and that of receivers, instead of a simple node clustering, thus giving a higher level dual insight.</p><p>Outline Our main goal is to address the general question of clustering versus co-clustering the nodes of an oriented graph in the context of blocks models, a family of probabilistic models for simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a data matrix. Section 2 introduces the main concepts and methods. Section 3 defines the framework of probabilistic block models LBM and SBM, presents their estimation and discusses model selection criteria. Section 4 is devoted to the comparison of both models on simulated data and section 5 on two real data sets. A discussion ends the article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Concepts and methods</head><p>Let us deeper enlighten the general problematic and introduce oriented graphs and their clustering.</p><p>Graphs A graph G is defined by a couple of two sets G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices, also called nodes, representing the individuals or entities, and E is a set of edges, pairs of vertices representing the connections between these vertices. A graph is characterized by its binary adjacency matrix A where A i j = 1 if there is an edge between the nodes i and j, and 0 otherwise.</p><p>The edges may be directed (or oriented) or not. The edges are said to be directed if edge (i, j) and edge ( j, i) (with i, j ∈ V , i = j ) are different, and the considered graph is called a directed graph. If the edges are not directed, (i, j) and ( j, i) represent the same edge and the graph is called undirected. For example, in case of mail exchanges, considering an oriented graph between people allows not only to model the range of the relationship, but also to take into account which is the sender and which is the receiver. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> gives an example of an undirected graph of five nodes A, B,C, D and E while Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts an oriented graph on these nodes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A • C • B • D • E • Figure 1: Undirected graph. A • C • B • D • E • Figure 2: Directed graph.</formula><p>The adjacency matrix is symmetric for an undirected graph and is in general non symmetric for a directed graph, see for example the adjacency matrix A u (resp. A d ) for the undirected (resp. directed) graph of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (resp. 2):</p><p>Graph clustering Clustering the nodes of a graph aims to find groups of nodes having a similar profile of connection, different from the connection profile of the nodes of the other groups. In case of the directed graph on Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, nodes C and D have a similar sending behavior (similar rows), while B and C have a similar receiving behavior (similar columns).</p><p>Imposing a unique clustering as it is usually done <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Girvan and Newman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goldenberg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Matias and Robin, 2014)</ref>   Bipartite graph It is interesting to note that Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> (d) can be seen as the result of a coclustering of a so called bipartite graph. Bipartite graphs are undirected graphs containing two subsets of nodes, say sets S and T . Nodes in S may be linked to nodes in T , but links between two nodes of the same set are not considered (cf. for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Holme et al. (2003)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wyse et al. (2018)</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> (a) gives a very simple example with the two sets S = {(A, B), (C, D)} and T = {(a, b, c), (d, e)}, and its adjacency matrix is: Notice that a bipartite graph can also have a representation as a particular undirected graph, considering the set of nodes V = S ∪ T :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A 4×5 d =        0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1        . A • B • C • D • a • b • c • d • e • Set S Set T (a) A • B • C • D • E • A • B • C • D • E • Set S Set T (b)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">A b = S T   0 A d t A d 0   }S }T with A d =     0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1     .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In fact, when the graph is a priori known to be bipartite, the submatrix A d is sufficient to define it, the full adjacency matrix A b is not used and only being displayed here to see the link between both.</p><p>As seen in the introduction, there are many real life networks that can be naturally viewed in this way, often used with different sets (set of customers and products for example). Our goal is to study whether it is worth considering a directed graph as a bipartite graph: in this case, the sets S and T are the same but the role of a node is different according it is regarded as a node in S or a node in T . Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 (d</ref>) and 4 (b) express the same situation: (i) The graph is not symmetric: node C in T is linked to node A in T but the node C in S is not linked to node A in T ; (ii) the clustering of the nodes S = {(A, B), (C, D, E)} viewed as source is different from clustering of the nodes T = {(A, B,C), (D, E)} viewed as target nodes are different, and amounts to co-cluster the two sets.</p><p>Methods There are many methods to cluster the nodes of a graph, from heuristics or insights on communities networks (such as modularity measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Newman, 2006)</ref>) to representation learning (such as spectral analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Von Luxburg, 2007)</ref>) and probabilistic or generative models. We focus here on the latter, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Matias and Robin (Matias and Robin, 2014)</ref> for a review. A reference model is the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). This model introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frank and Harary (1982)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Holland et al. (1983)</ref> has been conceived for the clustering of undirected graphs and works on the adjacency matrix. SBM has been extended to the clustering of weighted graphs and directed graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mariadassou et al., 2010)</ref>. This extension of SBM to directed graphs means that this model can be applied to non symmetric adjacency matrices, but it only provides a single clustering of the nodes and, for this very reason, could not take fully into account the different roles of the nodes in a directed graph. However, it could also be used to define two partitions using the full A b matrix, but at the cost of a huge augmentation of the data size as the number of nodes is doubled and of an increase of the number of parameters.</p><p>In the perspective to particularize the behavior of source and target nodes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Celeux and Vasseur (2018)</ref> advocates to use the Latent Block Model (LBM) for co-clustering a directed graph. LBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Govaert and Nadif, 2007)</ref> is devoted to the simultaneous clustering of the rows and columns of a rectangular matrix where rows and columns can represent different entities, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brault and Mariadassou (2015)</ref> for a review. In fact, it can be applied on the square adjacency matrix of a graph as a special case, hence considering source nodes (in rows) and target nodes (in columns) to be distinct. So LBM not only takes into account the non symmetry of the relationships, but also naturally provides a distinct clustering for the source and target nodes.</p><p>In other words, LBM can be regarded as a co-clustering model for directed graphs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3  (d)</ref>) while SBM offers a simple clustering model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 (c)</ref>).</p><p>Summary This section has developed and deeper enlightened the general problematic after presenting the context of directed graph clustering. In particular, it shows that defining two different clusters to capture different source and target behaviors remains to cluster a bipartite graph. In the context of block models, the question is: should we use a simple clustering (SBM) or a bipartite or co-clustering (LBM) for oriented graphs?</p><p>Remark Worth notice that the diagonal terms of the adjacency matrices of graphs are deterministic and always assumed to be zero as no self loop is admitted, and this is neglected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Block models</head><p>Block models are probabilistic generative models to cluster data arrays where the membership of the entities (nodes for SBM, rows and columns for LBM) are defined as latent variables. Once the parameters have been estimated, a Maximum A Posteriory rule is used to assign each entity to its most probable cluster. The estimation of both LBM and SBM follows the same principles and encounter similar difficulties and possible drawbacks, these being more challenging for LBM with its double latent structure. We sketch here the inference of these models and then discuss model selection criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The latent block model (LBM)</head><p>LBM introduced by Govaert and Nadif ( <ref type="formula">2007</ref>) is a co-clustering model of a matrix A, where the rows and columns can represent two different sets of individuals or entities. For example, rows can be considered as n individuals and columns as d variables. In text mining, rows are documents and columns are words, and an observation A i j is a count. In recommendation systems, rows are consumers and columns are products and an observation A i j is binary or a note. In general, the two sets are different and of different sizes.</p><p>As expressed in the book <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Govaert and Nadif (2013)</ref>, the main idea of co-clustering is to summarize the matrix A with a matrix of smaller dimension (H, L) having the same structure than A. This smaller matrix is associated with a couple of partitions (v, w), with H (resp. L) clusters on the rows (resp. columns) of A.</p><p>LBM assumes that blocks form a Cartesian product of a row-partition v in H row-clusters by a column-partition w in L column-clusters. The latent categorical variables v = (v 1 , . . . , v n ) and w = (w 1 , . . . , w d ) are supposed to be independent, and each component independently assigned with multinomial distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v i = (v i1 , . . . , v iH ) ∼ M (1, ρ = (ρ h ) h=1,...,H ), i = 1, . . . , n w j = (w j1 , . . . , w jd ) ∼ M (1, τ = (τ ) =1,...,L ), j = 1, . . . , d</formula><p>For example, v ih = 1 if the row i is in the cluster h, 0 otherwise. Then, knowing the latent variables v and w, the model assumes that random variables A i j are independent with conditional density φ whose the parameter matrix α only depends on the block (h, ). Thus the marginal density of A is the (generalized) mixture density <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Keribin et al., 2015)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p LBM (A; θ ) = ∑ (v,w)∈V ×W p(v; θ )p(w; θ )p(A|v, w; θ ) = ∑ (v,w)∈V ×W ∏ i,h ρ v ih h ∏ j, τ w j ∏ h,i, j, φ (A i j ; α h ) v ih w j ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where V and W represent the set of all possible partitions respectively for the n rows and the d columns, ρ and τ the mixing weights and θ = (ρ, τ, α) gathers the parameters. As a special case, LBM can be used to co-cluster square binary matrices of adjacency graphs such as A d , where the rows represent the source nodes and the columns the target nodes, i.e. n = d, but in this case row nodes and column nodes are considered as disconnected. Hence, two partitions are provided. Then, defining α h as the probability link in the block (h, ), the conditional density φ (A i j ; α h ) of random variable A i j knowing v ih = 1 and w j = 1 is assumed to be a Bernoulli distribution B(α h ) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">φ (A i j ; α h ) = α A i j h × (1 -α h ) 1-A i j .</formula><p>where α can be seen as the H × L summary matrix of probability connections, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5 (b)</ref> where H = L. The number of parameters to estimate in this case is (H -1) + (L -1) + HL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Stochastic Block Model (SBM)</head><p>SBM is a generative model for graphs that can be viewed as a LBM where rows ans columns are constraint to be the same entities in the same order, namely the nodes of a graph. Hence, there is only one set of latent categorical variables z defining the memberships of the nodes inside a partition of K clusters, which are independently drawn with a multinomial distribution of probability vector π = (π k = P(z ik = 1)) k=1,...,K . Conditionally to the latent variables z, the random variables A i j are independent binary variables with conditional density φ whose parameter matrix b only depends on the block (k, k ): b kk = P(A i j = 1|z ik = 1, z jk = 1). The marginal density of A is the mixture density of the following form for directed graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mariadassou et al., 2010)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p SBM (A; θ ) = ∑ z∈Z ∏ i,k π z ik k ∏ k,i, j,k ;i = j φ (A i j ; b kk ) z ik z jk ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Z represents the set of all possible partitions for the nodes, same for the rows and the columns, and θ = (π, b) is the vector of parameters.</p><p>In case of a symmetric graph, the likelihood is <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Daudin et al., 2008</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p sym (A; θ ) = ∑ z∈Z ∏ i,k π z ik k ∏ k,i, j,k ;i&lt; j φ (A i j ; b kk ) z ik z jk . (4)</formula><p>Thus, the number of parameter to be estimated for SBM is (K -1) + K 2 for a directed graph and (K -1) + K(K + 1)/2 for an undirected graph as the matrix b is symmetrical in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SBM, bipartite SBM, LBM</head><p>Equations 1 make the correspondence between the bipartite graph with adjacency matrix A d and the undirected graph with twice the nodes represented by adjacency matrix A b , to take into account the nodes behaviors as source S and target T , knowing that there is no link between S and T . In the same manner, it is possible to define a specific symmetric SBM that we could call bipartite SBM as a simple undirected SBM on A b with K + L clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> (a)) with null connection probability between source S and target T and no cluster mixing together nodes of S and T , which is an equivalent model to a LBM on A d with K × L blocks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5 (b)</ref>). In fact the likelihood of such defined bipartite SBM is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p biSBM (A b , θ ) = ∑ (v,w)∈V ×V n ∏ i=1 K ∏ k=1 π v ik k 2n ∏ j=n+1 K+L ∏ =K+1 π w j n ∏ i=1 K ∏ k=1 2n ∏ j=n+1 K+L ∏ =K+1 φ (A i j ; b k ) v ik w j (5)</formula><p>using the fact that b k, = 0 for (k, ) ∈ {1, . . . , K} 2 ∪ {K + 1, . . . , K + L} 2 and A i j = 0 for (i, j) ∈ {1, . . . , n} 2 ∪ {n + 1, . . . , 2n} 2 . This expression is equivalent to p SBM , see equation 2. Hence the likelihood of a LBM with K × L blocs observed on A d is equal to bipartite SBM (A b on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>) with K + L clusters and known information of S and T , but using the latter increases the data size. Notice that a backside question could be the ability for a symmetric SBM to recover a bipartite SBM from an adjacency matrix which is not known a priori to be bipartite while it is.</p><p>We rather focus here on graphs that are not a priori bipartite, but whose source and target nodes are allowed to belong to different clusters. We will see in section 4 that asymptotically, the best way SBM fits data generated with a model with different clusters on source and target nodes such as on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>   To precise a little more the way SBM follows to add new clusters when dealing with two different source and target clusterings, we introduce the source (resp. target) profile of a node as the row (resp.column) vector of parameter matrix α it refers to. For example, source profile of node C is (a 21 , a 22 ) for co-clustering (b) and (b 21 , b 22 , b 13 ) for simple clustering (c).</p><p>As mentioned above, the way SBM deals with nodes sharing the same source (resp. target) profile with another group of nodes, but with a different target (resp. source) profile is to create a new node cluster, adding (a number of two times the current number k of clusters) new connection coefficients. In fact, SBM always defines a clustering where diagonal blocks of the adjacency matrix are squares, see red segments on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> (c) depicting the split. Using LBM can help to retrieve a higher level of clustering by gathering together nodes with the same source profile, independently of their target profile in one hand, and nodes with the same target profile, independently of their source profile in one hand on the other: it aims at finding which rows (resp. columns) of the parameter matrix α of SBM are identical. Several cases can be considered:</p><p>-the generating model is a SBM where parameter matrix α has no identical rows neither identical columns. In this case, LBM has no interest and should lead to the same row and column clustering as SBM, K = H = L; -the generating model is a SBM with a square matrix α and with constraints similar to C : using LBM can give an insight on similar source (resp. target) profiles. The estimated LBM can be such that H = L or H = L. In any cases, K ≥ max(H, L); -the generating model is a LBM. In this case, as the row and column memberships u and v are not constrained to be the same, all combinations of row and column profiles are likely to appear, leading to K = LH groups, number of groups of the corresponding SBM with H identical rows, and L identical columns. This induces a very special configuration of the graph. If this case is theoretically interesting, it could be however doubtful do encounter it in real data sets.</p></div>

Hence strategies must be defined to perform the E step of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dempster et al. (1977)</ref>. Usually, a variational approximation of the conditional distribution is proposed with the so called Variational EM (VEM) algorithm.

(2015)</ref> for a discussion about these issues). In order to circumvent these issues, the estimation problem can be considered in a non informative Bayesian framework, as advocated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Keribin et al. (2015)</ref>. Once the number of classes fixed and using non informative priors, the model parameters are estimated through Gibbs sampling followed by a variational approximation of the posterior modes. Several runs based on different initializations are performed and the best result is kept.</p><p>An alternative way is to initialize with absolute eigenvalues spectral clustering. This variant of spectral clustering seems to give a very good first approximation of a clustering for the SBM case.

Selection of an adequate number of clusters is of major importance and is usually done with information criteria. The use of BIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Schwarz et al., 1978)</ref> is here questionable as an exact value of the maximum likelihood is not tractable, and conditions to perform the Laplace approximation not fulfilled. In another hand, ICL (Integrated Completed Likelihood) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Biernacki et al., 2000)</ref> is a good candidate as it involves the complete likelihood which expression is tractable in SBM or LBM models. Moreover, the binary case allows to have access to an exact expression of ICL when non informative conjugate priors are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Keribin et al., 2015)</ref>; hence there is no need of an asymptotic approximation as usual, but an asymptotic development can be done to get rid of the influence of the priors, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Keribin et al. (2015)</ref> for more details. These criteria are also available for SBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Daudin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mariadassou et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, the cluster (for SBM) or the couple of clusters (for LBM) providing the best ICL value is selected.</p><p>It remains to study the strategy to run through the models. As it is easy for SBM as the number of clusters in row and column is the same, it is trickier for LBM as two sets of clusters must be selected. To reduce the number of pairs of clusters to be considered, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Robert et al. (2020)</ref> designed the bi-km1 algorithm, an upward method which allows to reduce dramatically the number of considered pairs of clusters.

This leads to a corresponding SBM with K = HL clusters.</p><p>Case 4: Bipartite graph The objective is to illustrate the backside question of section 3.3, and compare both methods on a bipartite graph with no a priori knowledge of this characteristic.

The corresponding full bipartite matrix A b is then created, and rows and columns are reordered according to the same shuffling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first comment the choice of the software: among R packages, blockcluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Singh Bhatia et al., 2017)</ref> is dedicated to co-clustering with a wide range of algorithms and data types, it offers ICL values but does not directly implement model selection; bikm1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Robert, 2020)</ref> performs co-clustering for binary and Poisson latent block models and provides the bi-km1 procedure to investigate more efficiently the grid of numbers of clusters with exact ICL or approximate BIC. In another hand, blockmodels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Leger, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Leger, , 2016) )</ref> provides VEM estimation with absolute eigenvalues spectral clustering initialization for binary LBM and SBM. A forward method for model selection is implemented using the asymptotic ICL criteria. All these packages are available on available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at <ref type="url" target="https://CRAN.R-project.org">https://CRAN.R-project.org</ref>. We decide to use this latter as it allows to compare both models with the same software tool, hence setting them in the same experimental conditions, despite the fact that it would have been better to consider an exact ICL criterion. For different sizes (number of nodes n = 50, 100, 500, 1000) and for each case, B = 50 graphs are generated and estimation and selection are performed for both models. The results are gathered in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Case 1 (directed graph with a single partition for rows and columns) is without surprise favorable to SBM as the generative model. However, when the number of nodes n increases, LBM also recovers the right block structure and it can be checked that the estimated partitions are similar to the SBM estimated single partition.</p><p>Case 4 (results not displayed) shows exactly the same behaviour for SBM and LBM on the A b graph. As soon as n = 100, they perfectly retrieves the attended number ((K + L) × (K + L)) of blocks, with the correct null blocks, but the execution time is two to three times longer with LBM than with SBM. In fact, they recover the same target and source partitions as a K × L LBM on the A d matrix, and this latter is without surprise much more time efficient and must be used in a known bipartite situation. Hence the strength of the signal of the unknown bipartite situation (strictly no connection between two subsets) is large enough to counterbalance the increased size of and parameters of SBM.</p><p>When dealing with different partitions with some overlap for target and source nodes (Case 2), LBM performs very well as soon as n ≥ 100, for both cases H = L or H = L, while number of clusters K chosen by SBM increases with the number of nodes, even for a model generated with the same number of clusters for source and target nodes (H = L).</p><p>This behavior is exacerbated in Case 3, where the graph is generated according to a binary LBM: the number of clusters K chosen by SBM dramatically increases with the number of nodes, even for a model generated with the same number of clusters for source and target nodes (H = L). LBM on his side rapidly retrieves to generating model.</p><p>In both Case 2 and 3, we can moreover observe for sufficiently large n that SBM chooses K = HL, H being equal to L or not. Hence as expected, SBM clusters asymptotically, or at least with a sufficiently large number observations, the nodes according to their cross behavior between source and target profiles. Remember that constraints like C cannot be taken into account into the SBM estimation, as there is no way to know on which clusters to apply them. Hence, adding a new class (in row and then column) for SBM amounts to add 2k parameters if k is the current number of groups instead of only one if the constraints were taken into account, corresponding to the proportion of this new class. The increase of likelihood is then not sufficient with smaller n, there is not enough information and SBM loses its capacity to subdivide the clusters. Hence, it is stuck between the fact of subdividing the columns (resp. the rows) to improve the partitions while not subdividing the rows (resp. the columns) too much so as not to break homogeneous groups.</p><p>We illustrate this phenomenon on Case (2b) with n = 500. Model selection with ICL fully retrieves the two partitions (H = 5, L = 4) for LBM co-clustering while leads to a SBM clustering with K = 18 clusters, see Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> where the estimated groups have be reordered to let the structure appear. SBM replicates the structure of rows and column profile to manage the constraint of a single partition. Vertical pink dashed lines delimit five blocks of columns: the first two are similar with three different column profiles, the last three are also similar but with four different column profiles; horizontal pink dashed lines delimit five blocks of similar rows: the two from above gathering three clusters, the three from below gathering four clusters. Clusters 1 and 4 are not well separated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> center and right): split of one them would also split too similar rows. Moreover, this would have required 76 additional coefficients for little improvement in the likelihood. Notice that in this example, SBM with K = 20 clusters splits cluster 1 in two, and another cluster rather than cluster 4 (figure not shown).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>: A graph Case (2b), n = 500, co-clustered by LBM with 4 × 5 blocks (left), clustered by SBM with 18 classes (hence 18 × 18 blocks) (center).

K = 12 corresponds to a LBM model with H = 4, L = 3 as gathering the two first row classes in rows and the two column classes, connection parameters being the weighted mean of the coefficients concerned by the merge. We can see here the trade-off between the refinement of the columns without splitting homogeneous rows.</p></div>

It is here relatively easy to map the single SBM partition and the two LBM partitions in row and columns. The resulting clustering and co-clustering are represented Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>, according to this correspondence. We can see that LBM column cluster 4 (resp. 5) are approximately split in SBM clusters 4 and 5 (resp. 6 and 7). In that sense, LBM reveals a situation like Case 2, that can be interpreted as employees from cluster 4 and 5 receiving equivalently mails from other employees (equivalent column coefficients), but with different sending profiles: group 4 sends more emails to the other groups than group 5 (different row coefficients). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">13</ref> allows to compare the estimated SBM parameters after this merge to the corresponding estimated LBM parameters.</p><p>We can check that LBM column cluster 6 also results from the merge of SBM clusters 8 and 9 although these two latter do not have the column profile, see Figure <ref type="figure">12</ref>. A further coclustering with 10 × 10 blocks does not really change the situation. Moreover, we can also check that SBM node groups 8 and 9 and LBM row clusters 8 and 9 refer approximately to the same employees, but the sub-clustering is different depending on the method: co-clustering defines a row cluster 9 with employees never sending mails regardless what they receive while SBM prefers to distinguish two sub communities differing mainly by mail exchange inside the group. This difference is inherent to the intrinsic structure of each model.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Arabidopsis dataset</head><p>This dataset comes from a genomics network study where the biological setting is the Chlorophyllian plant Arabidopsis thaliana (At) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Swarbreck et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Castrillo et al., 2011)</ref>, composed of about 25,000 genes. Using gene expression, the objective is to model the interactions between genes, namely which genes called transcription factors are to target other genes to activate or inhibit them. From DNA chips experiments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vasseur (2017)</ref> sets up a directed graph with n = 1937 genes (nodes) modeling the gene network. The adjacency matrix of this graph is such that A i j = 1 if gene i is regulated by gene j and 0 otherwise. This graph was produced using variable selection procedures based on penalized linear regressions and resampling methods.</p><p>In fact, transcription factors work in groups and the simultaneous action of several transcription factors is necessary to activate or inhibit groups of target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wolpert, 1971)</ref>:</p><p>-active genes having an effect on the same regulated gene are called co-regulators -target genes being activate or deactivate by the same co-regulators are called co-regulated genes. The objective is to cluster the regulatory network regarding these two behaviors. As a directed graph, it is interesting to study whether a co-clustering view to group simultaneously co-regulators (in rows) in one hand and co-regulated (in columns) in another hand could be helpful or better suited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vasseur (2017)</ref> already performed this comparison and found that the chosen number of regulator and regulated clusters are almost the same (resp. H = 30 co-regulator clusters and L = 29 co-regulated clusters) with LBM co-clustering while SBM clustering chooses K = 22 node clusters. This result is surprising because we saw in section 3.3 that K is in general greater than min(H, L). This could mean that the solution is not the optimal one for one or both results, regarding the known difficulties of local optima. Another explanation is that these authors used two different block model softwares, namely bikm1 for LBM and blockmodels for SBM which do not have the same procedures, and especially for model selection: the former uses the exact ICL whereas the latter the asymptotic ICL. We run again the LBM co-clustering with blockmodels and find H = 19 and L = 17 which is now consistent with K = 22. It remains to compare the two partitions. The Adjusted Rand Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hubert and Arabie, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rand, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Youness and Saporta, 2004)</ref> is poor between the LBM row partition and the SBM node partitions (0.26), and between the LBM column partition and the SBM node partition (0.37). CARI <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Robert et al., 2020)</ref>, which an adaptation of ARI to the block classification framework can be used to compare the couple of row and column partitions of LBM to the couple of same SBM partitions. Its value here is 0.12. These scores indicate poor fits between these clusterings. Hence, it is difficult to compare or map them as they are largely entangled, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref>: no SBM class is mainly composed by a unique row or column LBM class as it could be attended.  In this case, it is difficult to say which representation must be preferred. First, LBM provides a slightly smaller ICL value than SBM (SBM : -669 030, LBM : -671 234), but we lack of theoretical ground to assess the use of ICL for this comparison. Secondly, the LBM blocks seems less contrasted and small clusters (which are of special interest for the biologists) are rare. Moreover, the LBM representation on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> could be misleading for a user of SBM adjacency graph, as nodes are no longer represented in the same order in row and column. Hence, in this case, LBM does not seem to deeper enlighten the dataset, except to propose outsider clusters. In other words, SBM and LBM induce different links between regulated and regulator genes. In this cas, an expert view would be necessary to propose a definite choice if any between these two representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The aim of this article is to question the use of simple clustering versus co-clustering for directed graphs, in order to fully take into account the non symmetry of such situation, namely not only the non symmetry of the connection parameter matrix, but also to the two specific roles (source, target) of a node: indeed, if node clustering such as SBM is largely used for directed graphs, could it be more relevant to perform a co-clustering LBM in some situations?</p><p>-Clustering a directed graph with a single partition could be restrictive since this model enforces source and target nodes to be in the same cluster. -However we show, at least when the graph is sufficiently large, that if nodes have the same row (resp. column) profile, but different column (resp. row) profiles, SBM is able to handle by creating a new node cluster. But this is done at the cost of adding two times the current number of parameters for one split even if many different coefficients are unnecessary. Moreover, if data is not sufficiently large with regards to the number of clusters, single SBM clustering is stuck between the fact of subdividing the columns (resp. the rows) to improve the partitions while not subdividing the rows (resp. the columns) too much so as not to break homogeneous groups. Co-clustering has here advantage as it allows naturally a more synthetic representation of this situation. It induces a specific set of connection constraints on the refined node clusters of the SBM clustering. -In another hand, inference with LBM is more complex and numerical difficulties are more important. Hence, if no merge of row or column profiles can be defined, SBM has advantage.</p><p>-If the question is whether a graph is bipartite as a not known a priori property, SBM and LBM retrieves similarly the partitions and hence the bipartite property, but SBM outperforms LBM regarding the execution time. -On real datasets, LBM co-clustering can help to give a higher level of representation for the SBM clustering, but the two methods can give also very different results with no clear cross interpretation, even if the number of blocks are of the same order. With its propensity to give a greater number of small clusters, SBM clustering could be preferred for some applications where small clusters are of special interest.</p><p>As a general recommendation, (single) clustering still remains the first method to use with real datasets, whether the graph is oriented or not. However, performing an additional co-clustering for oriented graphs can give a higher insight on the dataset. If co-clustering gives much less blocks than the single node clustering, it brings a valuable information on the presence of (a lot of) identical row or column profiles, and reveals some specific constraints on the connection parameters between the SBM clusters. If number of blocks have around the same order, it could be more difficult to have a precise interpretation especially when the partitions poorly matches. It can be hence seen as another view of the data. If LBM provides more blocks than SBM, both results should be questioned.</p><p>The choice between the two models can be done with a pragmatic view based on an expert interpretation of the blocks in each case. Assessing the use of ICL or some penalized selection criteria offers here interesting theoretical developments. First, the question of their consistency inside each model (either SBM, or LBM) is linked to the study of their asymptotic behaviour which is not, as far as we now, solved, see however some steps on penalized likelihood criteria in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang et al. (2017)</ref>; secondly, their use to compare the two approaches could be based on the link done through bipartite SBM. Anyway, the comparison of the blocks exhibited by the two methods could lead to interesting remarks, even if doing such comparisons properly is not easy and more heuristics than theoretically set.</p><p>It should be noted that the co-clustering representation can be misleading for users who are used to SBM clustering, as nodes in rows and columns can be differently sorted. To make easier the understanding, it could be interesting to transcript it in a SBM clustering representation with an identical node order in rows and columns, by creating as many new node clusters as needed. As a more general comment, it is always interesting to compare methods and give methodological guidelines to their applications on real data. Hence, this study could be enlarged to more methods, and especially of the representation learning category. Finally, this study also shows the need to have a unified software framework on block models, providing the wide range of existing estimation methods, as well as the different model selection strategies and model selection criteria.</p><p>Acknowledgement The author wants to acknowledge Gilles Celeux for suggesting the seminal idea of this work on the comparison between LBM and SBM for directed graphs, Yann Vasseur for providing the Arabidopsis dataset and Louise Alamichel for contributing to some preliminary computations.

None of them seems to be well suited in this case. In fact, C is a special node: its behavior as a source node is close to the sending behavior of nodes D and E (similar rows C, D and E), but its behavior as a target node is close to the receiving behavior of nodes A and B (similar columns A, B and C). Considering the clustering with the three groups {(A, B), (C), (D, E)} depicted in 3 (c) seems to better suit, by adding a specific cluster for this special node. But in this case, information is lost, namely the similar behavior of C with A and B as target node and with D and E as emitter node. Hence considering two different clusterings to qualify source and target node behaviors as in Figure 3 (d) seems to be the best way, but does not fulfill the single node clustering constraint anymore.</figDesc></figure>
