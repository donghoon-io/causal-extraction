<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many existing cohort studies initially designed to investigate disease risk as a function of environmental exposures have collected genomic data in recent years with the objective of testing for gene-environment interaction (G × E) effects. In environmental epidemiology, interest in G × E arises primarily after a significant effect of the environmental exposure has been documented. Cohort studies often collect rich exposure data; as a result, assessing G × E effects in the presence of multiple exposure markers further increases the burden of multiple testing, an issue already present in both genetic and environment health studies. Latent variable (LV) models have been used in environmental epidemiology to reduce dimensionality of the exposure data, gain power by reducing multiplicity issues via condensing exposure data, and avoid collinearity problems due to presence of multiple correlated exposures. We extend the LV framework to characterize gene-environment interaction in presence of multiple correlated exposures and genotype categories. Further, similar to what has been done in case-control G × E studies, we use the assumption of gene-environment (G-E) independence to boost the power of tests for interaction. The consequences of making this assumption, or the issue of how to explicitly model G-E association has not been previously investigated in LV models. We postulate a hierarchy of assumptions about the LV model regarding the different forms of G-E dependence and show that making such assumptions may influence inferential results on the G, E, and G × E parameters. We implement a class of shrinkage estimators to data adaptively trade-off between the most restrictive to most flexible form of G-E dependence assumption and note that such class of compromise estimators can serve as a benchmark of model adequacy in LV models. We demonstrate the methods with an example from the Early Life Exposures in Mexico City to Neuro-Toxicants Study of lead exposure, iron metabolism genes, and birth weight.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is now clear from many lines of evidence that pure genetics or pure environmental factors play only a partial role in the etiology of most complex diseases. Instead, it is now accepted that the majority of chronic diseases likely stem from interactions between genetic traits, "G," and environmental factors, "E"-an exponentially growing area of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Khoury and Wacholder, 2009)</ref>. Characterizing gene-environment interactions, "G × E effects," is critical in understanding the biological mechanisms of disease etiology and can impact preventive medicine and public health by informing the way clinicians advise their patients and the way public health practitioners assess risk and set policy. Statistical approaches that heighten our ability to understand G × E effects can accelerate mapping of the so far elusive environmental footprint of disease etiology.</p><p>Established environmental health cohorts that have demonstrated modest health effects of the environment are now collecting genomic data to test G × E effects. However, G × E interaction studies are statistically difficult problems because of exposure measurement error, multiple potential exposure markers, and prohibitive sample sizes required to reach adequate power. Statistical methods to boost efficiency for testing G × E effects have primarily been developed for case-control studies, where imposing the assumption of independence be-tween environmental exposures and inherited genetic susceptibility factors, so called G-E independence, boosts efficiency of G × E effect estimates <ref type="bibr">(Chatterjee and Carroll, 2005, and references therein)</ref>. Hybrid approaches that protect against bias under departures from independence constraints have also been proposed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mukherjee and Chatterjee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen, Chatterjee, and Carroll, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li and Conti, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Latent variable (LV) models have been used in environmental health studies to extract features from a set of correlated biomarkers, thus reducing dimensionality of exposure data and multiple testing burden, and enhancing power (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003b)</ref>. These models have enormous potential for modeling gene-environment interaction between multiple genes and multiple environmental exposures, an area which is still in its formative phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chatterjee et al. (2006)</ref> motivate a one degree of freedom test for gene-gene interactions from an LV perspective in a case-control study. However, the issue of modeling G-E dependence through the LV framework is not discussed. More general LV models, as proposed here, can incorporate and estimate G-E association structures, which are of interest to environmental health researchers, and also impose constraints such as independence. In our motivating example, the relationship between iron metabolism genes and lead exposure is of interest in itself (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hopkins et al., 2008)</ref>  attempts exist that pose a general LV model for studying G × E effects in cross-sectional or cohort studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dhungana et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rathouz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Javaras, Hudson, and Laird, 2010)</ref>, especially those investigating an array of G-E dependence structures.</p><p>The Early Life Exposures in Mexico City to Neuro-Toxicants (ELEMENT) Study motivates our work. ELE-MENT consists of four longitudinal birth cohorts in Mexico City, constituting over 2000 mother infant pairs with prospectively collected exposure data and several anthropometric, cardiovascular, neurodevelopment, and behavioral outcomes. Genotyping for these cohorts is underway, with genotyping for the first cohort completed on a set of candidate genes (≈400 pairs). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is a path diagram describing relationships between four biomarkers of prenatal lead exposure, their interaction with iron metabolism genes, and birth weight.</p><p>In Section 2, we describe a model structure to summarize a group of biomarkers into LVs, and the spectrum of G-E dependence models we consider. In Section 3, we describe maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and a general class of shrinkage estimators to data adaptively compromise between the most stringent and most flexible models for G-E association. Smallscale simulation studies (Section 4) bring out salient features of our methodology. Section 5 presents analyses of our motivating example. Section 6 discusses the use of LV models for G × E studies, and shrinkage estimators in general LV modeling beyond the G × E context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Model Representation</head><p>For the ith of N individuals, let Y i represent a univariate health outcome (here birth weight), and U i be an l × 1 vector of latent exposures measured indirectly by a set of p measurements E i . In the example, l = 1, p = 4, and U i is prenatal lead exposure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Let Z i and W i represent q × 1 and r × 1 covariate vectors, respectively. Without any loss of generality, genotype classes are represented by a categorical variable G i with classes g = 0, . . . , G. Genotype classes may arise from data on biallelic polymorphisms where a "risk" allele "A" may alter the exposure metabolism pathway or affect health (with the reference allele denoted by "a") or from combinations of genetic markers measured at multiple loci (e.g., risk alleles A, B). In the lead example we consider two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in iron metabolism, but due to sparsity of data, we assume G i can take two possible values: zero for wild type on both SNPs ("aa" and "bb"), and 1 for at least one copy of either of the risk alleles (i.e., "Aa," "AA,", "Bb," or "BB"), consistent with dominant/recessive models for genetic susceptibility. Alternatively, genetic groups can arise as categorization of an underlying genetic risk score that combines several markers identified by existing genome-wide association studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Qi et al., 2011)</ref>, or from infant-mother genotype combinations at a single locus in studies of prenatal fetal exposure.</p><p>The LV model is then specified in two stages: a health outcome model and an exposure model. In the outcome model, the association between the outcome Y i , exposure U i and genetic category G i = g conditional on covariates Z i is characterized by either</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y i = β 0,g + β U ,g U i + β Z ,g Z i + i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>or</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y i = β 0 + β U U i + G g =1 β g I g i + β g ×U I g i • U i + β Z Z i + β g ×Z I g i • Z i + i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>using genotype class indicators I gi = I(G i = g). The meanzero error i has variance σ 2 . Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is written using the multiple group notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollen 1989)</ref>, which is useful in writing the likelihood (Section 3), and β 0,g , β U ,g , β Z ,g are parameters specific to class g = 0, . . . , G. Such notation is standard in widely used LV software. In (1), the gene-environment interaction test is specified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H 0 : β U , 0 = ••• = β U , G , i.e.</formula><p>, homogeneity of the environment's effects across genetic groups, and is equivalent to testing the interaction parameters in (2), i.e., H 0 : </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">β g ×U = β U ,g -β U ,0 = 0 for all g = 1, . . . , G. G × E</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">U i = α 0g + α W W i + ξ i (3) E i = ν g + Λ g U i + δ i (4)</formula><p>with ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and (4) again written in the multiple group notation. Regression coefficients α 0g and α W are l × 1 and l × r matrices with γ g = α 0g -α 00 being effect of genotype class on exposure U i , and covariates W i (r × 1) may help predict exposure levels for a given subject (e.g., occupation). The zeromean error terms, ξ i , are assumed independent of i , and have category-specific l × l covariance matrices Φ g . Means vector ν g and factor loading matrix Λ g are p × 1 and p × l, respectively, and δ i has zero mean and p × p covariance matrix Θ g . Although LV models are helpful in many respects, one well-known problem is the potential for lack of identifiability. Standard identifiability constraints have been developed for linear latent variable models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>, and identifiability of latent class models has also been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Huang and Bandeen-Roche, 2004</ref>). Essentially, model parameters are constrained to ensure identifiability; for example, some entries of ν g and Λ g are fixed to 0 or 1, although sometimes algebraic proofs of identifiability are needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sánchez et al., 2005</ref>). In the lead example, the constraints ν g = (0, ν g ,2 , ν g ,3 , ν g ,4 ) , and Λ g = (1, λ g ,2 , λ g ,3 , λ g ,4 ) fix the mean and scale of the latent exposure to those of patella lead. Parameters in Φ g are typically unconstrained, while the off-diagonal elements of Θ g are typically, although not necessarily, restricted to be zero denoting conditional independence between E i 's given U i . However, theoretical identifiability may not necessarily guarantee numerical stability of results, which also depends on sample sizes. Some investigators recommend at least 5 to 10 observations per parameter estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Westland, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, users need to be attentive as to what model the available sample size allows them to fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modeling G-E Dependence</head><p>In many G × E studies, it may be natural to assume that an individual's environmental exposure is independent of genetic factors, but may not be realistic when the gene and the exposure share a metabolic pathway. For example, iron metabolism genes may increase lead absorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hopkins et al., 2008)</ref>, and characterizing such dependence may shed insight into the mechanistic process.</p><p>Varying degrees of G-E dependence can be modeled through imposing further constraints on the exposure model parameters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The most restrictive assumption is that parameters are homogeneous across genotypes. We use "A0" to denote this full G-E independence</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A0 : (α 0g , Φ g , ν g , Λ g , Θ g ) = (α 0 , Φ, ν, Λ, Θ).</formula><p>With A0, the exposure model ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)-(4) has at least l parameters in each of α 0 and Φ, pl factor loadings Λ and pl intercepts ν, and p parameters Θ, for a total of at least 3p parameters. In the lead exposure model, A0 totals 13 exposure model parameters.</p><p>A first step at relaxing A0 is to allow the intercepts and variances in the LV equation (3) to differ by genotype. Letting γ g = α 0gα 00 be the gene effect on the latent exposure we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A1 : (ν g , Λ g , Θ g ) = (ν, Λ, Θ), but γ g = 0 or Φ -1</formula><p>g Φ 0 = I for at least one g. Relaxing these constraints is very natural, because genotype status may increase absorption of pollutants from the environment as well as change exposure variability. Genotype status may change the distribution of the observed exposure measures, E i , but modeling change in the distribution of the underlying exposure is a parsimonious way of modeling changes in the actual E i . This assumption has at least 3p + 2lG exposure model parameters; 15 in the lead example. Alternatively, one could restrict the latent variable variances Φ g to be equal across genotype subgroups; that is, a slightly modified assumption A1 * : (Φ g , ν g , Λ g , Θ g ) = (Φ, ν, Λ, Θ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Y U E 2 E 1 E 3 E p G 1 2 3 p 2 p 3 g Uxg U,g 1 Var( |G)=Var( ) Var( |G)=Var( ) A0 … 1 2 3 2 p 3 g 1 Var( |G)=Var( ) A1 E 2 E 1 E 3 E p p … Y U G g Uxg U,g 1 2 3 2,g p,g 3,g 1 Var( |G)=Var( ) E 2 E 1 E 3 g Y U g Uxg U,g G E p p … A2 1 2 3 2,g p,g 3,g 1 E 2 E 1 E 3 g Y U g Uxg U,g</formula><p>Next, constraints of equal means ν and factor loadings Λ can be removed,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A2 : Θ g = Θ.</formula><p>Biological mechanisms that modify transfer of pollutants from one compartment to another are consistent with this assumption. In the lead example, three of the observed prenatal lead exposure biomarkers are measured on the mother, while umbilical cord blood on the offspring. The transfer rates from maternal compartments (i.e., blood and bone) to offspring compartment may vary by child's genotype, such that factor loading λ 4 may vary by genotype. A2 has at least 3p + 2Gp exposure model parameters; 21 in the lead example.</p><p>Lastly, all equality constraints on the parameters can be removed, namely, A3 : All model parameters differ by genotype, yielding at least 4p + 2Gp exposure model parameters; 26 in the lead example. In classical multiple group analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>, one might additionally posit that the structure of the whole model might differ by genotype; e.g., that the number of latent variables differs by genotype. We restrict our attention to assumptions A0-A3, where the model structure is the same across genotypes.</p><p>Assumptions A0-A3 have different number of parameters; an increase from 13 to 26 parameters in the example. Constraints on exposure model parameters may increase efficiency and power for the main hypotheses (G, E or G × E tests), but could induce bias in parameters of interest if they are incorrectly assumed. Model evaluation strategies are available that may help select which assumption A0-A3 fits the data best <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bentler and Hu, 1995)</ref>. However, this task may not be straightforward because many fit criteria exist for LV models. Furthermore, testing all parameter constraints may incur a high type 1 error rate, because the study will unlikely be powered to detect significant differences across genotypes in all model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Parameter Estimation</head><p>Although various estimation procedures have been proposed for LV models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>, full MLE is the most common estimation procedure given its wide availability in software packages. We review MLE and describe the implementation of shrinkage estimators that combine MLE estimates. Using shrinkage estimators may be a more suitable approach for parameter estimation. The strategy would be to fit the most restrictive model A0 and the most flexible model A3 (or A2 depending on sample size), and then use shrinkage to derive the final composite estimates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Shrinkage Estimation</head><p>Shrinkage estimators have been used in outcome-dependent sampling based studies as a way to balance bias and efficiency gains from assuming G-E independence while using a retrospective likelihood formulation of the model. Shrinkage approaches will enhance efficiency only when the retrospective model improves efficiency. A typical formulation will factorize the retrospective likelihood p</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(G, E, Z | Y; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) as p(Y | G, E, Z; θ 1 )p(G | E, Z; θ 2 )p(E, Z; θ 3 )/p(Y; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 )</formula><p>with θ 1 being the outcome model parameters, θ 2 and θ 3 describing the G-E dependence and exposure-covariate associations, respectively, and the G-E association reflected through the term</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">p(G | E, Z; θ 2 ). Because p(Y; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) = G, E , Z p(Y | G, E, Z; θ 1 )p(G | E, Z; θ 2 )p(E, Z; θ 3 ) (in</formula><p>the denominator) depends on the specification of p(G | E, Z; θ 2 ), the MLE of θ 1 depends on the assumed model for the G-E association conditional on covariates. It has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chatterjee and Carroll, 2005)</ref> that assuming conditional G-E independence, p(G | E, Z; θ 2 ) = p(G | Z; θ 2 ), in case-control studies leads to large efficiency gain for estimating the G × E interaction parameter in the outcome model p(Y | G, E, Z; θ 1 ). However, under violation of the independence assumption, these estimators are biased. Shrinkage estimators then arise as a weighted average of two estimators: one obtained under dependence and the other obtained under independence; the weights are chosen in a dataadaptive fashion and reflect the uncertainty around the conditional G-E association <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mukherjee and Chatterjee, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2009)</ref> propose a class of shrinkage estimators applicable, in principle, to estimation problems beyond G × E effects. Shrinkage estimates can be motivated from an Empirical Bayes (EB) perspective.</p><p>In a cohort or cross-sectional study, maximization of the joint likelihood with respect to outcome model parameters, even from modeling the joint distribution p(Y, G, E | Z; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ), will be independent of the specification of p(G, E | Z; θ 2 , θ 3 ). Because of the lack of outcome dependent sampling, and thus absence of conditioning on Y, the log likelihood becomes a sum of two terms that can be maximized separately.</p><p>However, the proposed LV framework allows us to incorporate constraints on the G-E association (Section 2.2), raising the possibility of gaining efficiency. In the LV framework, estimation of G-E model parameters cannot be completely disentangled from estimation of outcome model parameters due to integration of the likelihood over the LV. The extent of efficiency and power gains for testing of outcome parameters due to such constraints depends on design and effect size settings that we investigate in our simulation study. Although extensive work exists on using G-E independence assumptions in case-control studies, this article is the first to propose and study the implications such assumptions in an LV setting.</p><p>We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2009)</ref> to describe how estimates obtained under assumptions A0 and A1 -A3 can be combined. Denoting the two estimates by θ A 0 and θ A * ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">θ shrink = θ A * + K mv ( θ A 0 -θ A * ) ( 5 )</formula><p>is the shrinkage estimator, where A * is any of A1 -A3 and shrinkage weights are</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">K mv = V ( V + ψ ψ ) -1 , with ψ = θ A 0 -θ A *</formula><p>and V is the estimated asymptotic covariance matrix of ψ. Alternatively, one may use a diagonal weight matrix K cw , where the kth diagonal element is V k /( V k + ψ 2 k ); V k being the kth diagonal element of V and ψ k the kth component of ψ. Choosing K cw leads to "component-wise (CW)" shrinkage, because the weights used for a given component of θ shrink depend only on the variance and bias related to that component; we call these estimates EB cw . In contrast, using K mv leads to so-called multivariate (MV) shrinkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2009)</ref>, which we refer to as EB mv . In both cases we use superscripts to denote which estimates were combined, e.g., EB 03  mv denotes combination of estimates obtained under assumptions A0 and A3. Note that (5) is only defined for parameters that are common to both models, and we have slightly abused notation by using θ A * in (5) to only represent the subset of parameters that are equivalent to those in θ A 0 .</p><p>Additional considerations about shrinkage estimators are worth mentioning. First, CW shrinkage may be desirable in terms of efficiency gain, compared to multivariate shrinkage in small samples, because large sampling error in the offdiagonals of V undermines the potential efficiency gain from multivariate shrinkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2009)</ref>. Second, the form of the weights imply that EB mv estimates will be more prone to favoring the more flexible models. To see this, note that the component-wise shrinkage weights (the kth diagonal element of K cw ) can be rewritten as 1/(1 + χ 2 k ), where χ 2 k = ψ 2 k / V k is the ratio of the squared difference in the kth parameter between the two models divided by variance of the difference. The MV shrinkage weights can be similarly rewritten: 1/(1</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">+ χ 2 ) where χ 2 = ψ V -1 ψ. χ 2</formula><p>k and χ 2 can be interpreted as a bias-variance ratios; when they are smaller than one, the EB estimates will lean toward the simpler model. In contrast to CW shrinkage, the MV shrinkage weight is the same for all parameters, but the ratio χ 2 is a weighted sum of all the bias-variance ratios for all model parameters. Hence, in MV shrinkage, a given parameter might be shrunk given not only its own bias-variance ratio χ 2 k but also given bias-variance ratios for other parameters. Furthermore, χ 2 k has expectation (approximately) 1 when independence holds, whereas χ 2 has expectation equal to the number of model parameters estimated with assumption A0. Hence, MV shrinkage weights 1/(1 + χ 2 ) will almost always be small, leading to EB estimates closer to those from more flexible models. Third, the weights summarize information about model fit in the sense of comparing differences in estimated parameters. If the models fit equally well, then corresponding parameters would likely be similar. Large differences in corresponding parameters indicate a poorer fitting model (e.g., constrained model). Hence, shrinkage estimates can help assess model adequacy, with smaller weights for the constrained model implying the more flexible model is preferred.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Simulation Studies</head><p>We conducted a small-scale simulation study to examine the finite sample properties of estimators under various settings of the true data generating model using l = 1, p = 4, and two genetic classes. Genetic class was generated as a binary variable with prevalence 0.2, similar to our data example. Because there are only two gene classes and one latent exposure, in this section (and Section 5) we denote the gene effect among unexposed, the exposure effect among wild types, and the interaction parameters as β G , β U , β G×U . We investigate the estimators' properties under two scenarios of the G-E association: independence (A0) and dependence (A3). We used either</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">β U = β G = β G×U = 0 or β U = 1, β G = β G×U = 2 (i.e.</formula><p>, standardized effects of 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, respectively, because outcome variance was σ 2 = 5 2 ). See Supplementary Materials for full design.</p><p>Type I error: When G and E are independent, all approaches retain rejection probabilities (P(R)) of approximately 0.05 for tests at the 0.05 significance level ( c Multiple regression using one exposure marker, E 1 . d Multiple regression using first PCA of (E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , E 4 ) as exposure marker. § 4.6% (A0) and 7.0% (A3) data sets excluded to lack of convergence or unstable results, see Supplementary Materials for details.</p><p>Efficiency/power: When G-E independence holds (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>, scenario A0), gains in efficiency for β G and β G ×U estimated from A0 compared to A1-A3 are very clear: the variance ratio (Var.R) for β G ×U estimated under A3 versus A0 is 1.90. Efficiency gains translate to large power gains: power for β G ×U is 0.44 under A3 and 0.66 under A0. Compared to A3, EB 03 cw and EB 03  mv have lower variance ratios (1.46 and 1.74, respectively) and higher power (0.53 and 0.49, respectively). The PCA approach has power comparable to that from A0, despite the bias in β U and β G ×U .</p><p>Bias: When G-E independence does not hold, all parameter estimates have large biases, except those from A3 and EB 03 mv (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>, scenario A3). Of the MLEs, bias is larger when A0 or A1 are assumed; further, A1 versus A0 does not result in uniformly less (absolute) bias for both β U and β G×U . Simply relaxing the assumption of different mean and variance for the LV, but not the measurement model, may not be sufficient to reduce bias, and could in fact increase it.</p><p>EB cw estimates are approximately half way between A0 and the more flexible models, although the exact distance varies depending on the magnitude of the coefficient. As such, they retain some of the bias of A0 estimates when G-E dependence exists. For EB 01  cw , the bias persists and is larger for β U and β G×U than the bias in A0 for these parameters. In contrast, EB 02 mv and EB 03 mv are generally closer to the more flexible model (see Section 3.2), and mostly eliminate the bias in A0.</p><p>As would be expected from the measurement error literature, parameter estimates using only E1 or PCA as the predictor in multiple regression analysis are biased, i.e., β U and β G ×U are attenuated. However, note that β G have large bias as well, due to the G-E dependence and the measurement error in E1 or the first PC in measuring exposure. Measurement error in one predictor (e.g., E 1 ) can induce bias in regression coefficients of covariates measured without error (e.g., G) that are correlated with the error-prone predictor <ref type="bibr">(Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003a)</ref>. The bias in β G can be in either positive or negative under the alternative hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Huang, Wang, and Cox, 2005)</ref>, although estimates will be unbiased when there is no exposure effect (β U = β G×U = 0, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>).</p><p>MSE: EB 03 mv estimates eliminate the bias in A0, but are less efficient; EB 03 cw retain some bias, but achieve smaller c Multiple regression using one exposure marker, E 1 . d Multiple regression using first PCA of (E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , E 4 ) as exposure marker. § 3.6% (A0) and 2.4% (A3) data sets excluded to lack of convergence or unstable results, see Supplementary Materials for details. mean squared error (MSE); hence, a better bias-efficiency tradeoff. For example, although EB 03 cw incurs 15% bias, its MSE is 0.93, in contrast to an MSE of 1.31 for EB 03  mv . EB cw estimators achieve a better bias-variance compromise in small samples compared to EB mv .</p><p>Additional simulation results for the case of null main effects and small interaction parameter: β U = 0, β G = 0, and β G×U = 0.1 demonstrate that efficiency gains in A0 versus A3 are still observed (Var.R = 1.5). Although to a smaller degree, bias in β G ×E persisted when incorrectly assuming A0 (11% versus 3% bias in A3).</p><p>Recommendation: For hypothesis testing alone, PCA approaches may be just as good as using a full LV model because they maintain type I error (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>) and have power comparable to A0 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>). However, in terms of both bias and efficiency, using EB 03 mv is our recommended estimation strategy. Although EB 03 mv has slightly higher MSE than EB 03 cw , it yields unbiased estimates, provides better control of type I error, and has higher power than EB 03 cw .</p></div>

The largest point estimate is obtained under assumption A1, whereas the lowest is obtained using MLR with the observed patella lead measure as the exposure marker. Such large attenuation in the MLR estimate is due to measurement error of patella lead in capturing prenatal exposure. Similarly, the MLR effect estimated from a PCA-derived exposure summary is attenuated, consistent with the simulation studies. Among the MLE and EB estimates, those obtained from assumptions A0 and A1 * have the smallest standard errors, that increase with increasing flexibility of the model as expected. The PCA and MLR standard errors are much smaller, and therefore, even though the point estimates are also largely attenuated, the test statistics are similar to those for the MLE estimates. Component-wise shrinkage estimates are approximately halfway between those from A0 and those from the more flexible models A1 * -A3. EB 01  cw is closer to the estimates obtained assuming A1, but EB 02 cw and EB 03 cw are closer to the estimates from A0 than from those obtained with A2 or A3. In contrast, EB 02 mv and EB 03 mv are closer to the estimates from A2 or A3 compared to those from A0. CW shrinkage favors simpler models because it only trades off bias-variance in one parameter at a time, whereas MV shrinkage favors the more flexible model because it simultaneously considers differences in all model parameters (Section 3.2).</p><p>Estimates and standard errors for β G are fairly constant across G-E assumptions and EB estimates. However, β G from MLR and PCA are much higher (more negative) than those from MLE. This can be due to bias arising due to exposuregene correlation and exposure measurement error <ref type="bibr">(Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Huang et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Being variant for iron metabolism genes is protective against reduced birth weight due to lead exposure ( β G ×U are positive), as hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cantonwine et al., 2010)</ref>. Whereas assumptions about G-E independence did not ultimately alter the conclusions for the main effect among wild types (e.g., all t-test statistics T U &lt; -2.4 in all assumptions), conclusions about β G ×U are impacted by the assumed G-E model. The most flexible model yields largest estimated effects (105.0 g with A3 versus 92.4 g with A0) and the standard error is lower (49.2 in A3 versus 63.5 in A0), resulting in t-statistics for the G × U effect as low as T G×U = 1.46 (A0) and as large as 2.13 (A3). This is likely due to a higher degree of overall model residual variance explained in A3 due to an increased number of parameters (i.e., lowest -2 log likelihood, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>).</p><p>Differences in MLE estimates for the outcome parameters can be largely explained by a few key differences exposure model parameters by genotype (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>). While there is little difference in average exposure levels between wild types and variants (small γ g ), the variance of the LV is twice as high among variants ( Φ g =1 = 2.11) than among wild types ( Φ g =0 = 1.05). Residual variances for E 1 and E 2 , Θ 11 and Θ 22 , also appear to differ between genotypes (51% and 72% difference, respectively), as does λ 4 (17% difference). This deserves further study-e.g., differences in Θ 11 and Θ 22 might be due to maternal genotypes, which are inherently correlated to infant genotype. Such investigation is out of the scope of the current work, but this finding highlights the utility of LV models in elucidating potential biological pathways.</p><p>In this example, implementing multivariate shrinkage was possible only for combining estimates from A0 with those from A3 and A0 with A2 estimates. MV shrinkage using A0 and A1 (and A1 * ) estimates resulted in a numerically singular vari-ance matrix Σ = Var(( θ A 0 , θ A * ) ), likely due to measurement model parameters being too similar (and correlated) when only making small changes in the LV model (3). Although in the example we implemented all approaches for exposition, and even though standard model fit criteria (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>) would point toward model A1 being a better model in this particular example, as a general strategy we prefer outcome model parameters estimated using the EB 03 mv approach. This approach avoids the potential for increased type I errors due to fitting multiple models before arriving at a final model, and minimizes bias in outcome model parameters that may persist due to differences in exposure model parameters associated to genotype that may not be declared "significantly different" due to lack of power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The presence of multiple correlated measures of exposure exacerbates existing challenges in G × E studies. The current article is the first step toward an integrated framework where LV models are used to reduce the dimensionality of the exposure measures, thereby limiting the number of tests made and boosting power. Due to the general model formulation, it is easy to accommodate measurement errors in predictors, a pervasive problem in environmental epidemiology, and reduce multicollinearity concerns. Furthermore, a major intuitive appeal of the LV approach is that it provides not only estimates of the disease model parameters, but also a clearer picture of the underlying G-E association and helps capture the essence of the scientific problem. For a genetic marker and exposure which may have a common metabolic pathway, this model is more meaningful to practitioners than a multiple regression model relating Y i to G i and E i , which is not informative about the association between G i and E i .</p><p>Because of the flexibility afforded by LV models, challenge is the potential for model misspecification. In this particular application of LV models, we described various specifications of the G-E association, and discussed how restrictions in the G-E model boost efficiency of the G × E associations, but may incur bias when such restrictions are incorrectly made. We proposed a strategy where one would fit a restricted model and the most flexible model afforded by the data, and then combine estimates based on shrinkage ideas. The proposed approach yields estimates that data adaptively compromise between bias and variance, and avoids having to fit and refit models until a best-fitting model is found. Alternatively, estimation could proceed in two stages. First, the most flexible model could be estimated, and genotype differences in exposure model parameters tested. In the second stage, parameters that were found to not differ by genotype would be constrained to be equal across genotypes. However, such twostage approach would also suffer from inflated type I error <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mukherjee and Chatterjee, 2008</ref>). Yet another alternative, with a similar flavor to what we proposed here, is to average parameter estimates obtained under various G-E assumptions according to prior information of the G-E association <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li and Conti, 2009)</ref> or using model fit criteria as weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hjort and Claeskens, 2003)</ref>. Further still, one could use LASSO or Ridge penalties to select which exposure model parameters vary by genotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Leoutsakos et al., 2010)</ref>. Lastly, extensions of the methods proposed could include using a continuous genetic risk score G, such that a larger number of genetic categories can be (indirectly) included without collapsing to a few categories due to limited sample size. Such extension may not be straightforward because the multiple group analysis used here would not apply. Compromise estimators like the ones presented have not been used in the LV modeling literature, but can be a tool to achieve improved modeling strategies and robustness in LV models in applications even beyond G × E studies.</p><p>It is possible that one may use the proposed approach for screening G × E effects in genome-wide interaction studies. In our simulation studies, the estimation procedure takes approximately 0.36 minutes per data set in a desktop computer with 3.2 GHz Intel processor and 1 GB RAM. In the advent of cluster and parallel computing the proposed approach is scalable to genome-wide studies. Nevertheless, if the intent is solely testing, and not estimation, the PCA approach may be suitable, because, as shown in the simulation studies, it had comparable power to the proposed shrinkage estimates, despite substantial bias. Employing dimension-reduction approaches to the environmental exposure data will reduce multiple testing problems because only one genome-wide scan would be needed, instead of one scan for each observed exposure. Our methods are particularly appealing to study G × E effects with a given environmental exposure and genetic subclasses defined through genes on a related metabolic pathway.</p><p>The availability of higher-dimensional genomic data, and multiple continuous or categorical outcomes point to several extensions of our work. General LV models encompass latent class models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh, 2004)</ref>; hence one could posit a latent class model for multiple genetic factors, G i , which borrows strength from multiple loci and can minimize the chance of false positives <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Schumacher and Kraft, 2007)</ref>. Recent proposals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chatterjee et al., 2006)</ref> pose genegene interaction models based on an LV approach, and can be extended to reduce the dimension of gene-gene-environment interaction models. Similar to what we have done for the exposure model in the present article, a latent outcome model to summarize correlated multivariate or longitudinal outcome data Y i can be proposed. One would summarize multivariate correlated outcomes by latent traits, i.e., express Y i in terms of latent outcomes f i (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003b)</ref>, and estimate model parameters for a regression of f i on U i and G i . When Y i involves repeated measures over time (e.g., growth curves), the model for the observed multivariate vector Y i for subject i, measured at multiple time points may contain a random slope and random intercept, which are inherently latent variables. The random effects can be modeled as dependent on U i and G i and other covariates, such that inferences on how exposure and genes modify growth rates can naturally be obtained. Moreover, multivariate observations reflecting LVs repeated over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Roy and Lin, 2000)</ref>, and time-to-event data <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Proust-Lima et al., 2009)</ref> can be incorporated. In summary, extensions of the present model can involve summarization of all three data components: Y, G, and E.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
