<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The turbulent exchanges, or fluxes, of heat, moisture and momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean play a crucial role in the Earth's climate system. Direct measurements of turbulent fluxes are very challenging and sparse, and do not span the full range of environmental conditions that exist over the ocean. This means that empirical "bulk formulae" parameterizations that relate direct flux observations to concurrent measurements of the mean meteorological and sea surface variables contain considerable uncertainty. In this paper, we present a Python 3.6 (or higher) open-source software package "AirSeaFluxCode" for the computation of the heat (latent and sensible) and momentum fluxes. Ten different parameterizations are included, each based on published descriptions or code and each derived from a different set of observations, or different assumptions about the turbulent exchange processes. They represent a range of current expert opinion on how the fluxes depend on mean properties and can be used to explore uncertainty in calculated fluxes. AirSeaFluxCode also allows the adjustment of the mean meteorological input parameters (air temperature, humidity and wind speed) from the height at which they are obtained to a user-defined output height. This height adjustment enables the comparison of measurements, or modelderived values, made at different heights above sea-level. The parameterizations calculate the fluxes using input parameters that are relatively easily to measure, or are available as model output: wind speed, air temperature, sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity. Where original code is available we have compared its output with that of AirSeaFluxCode. Any changes made to increase consistency across algorithms by standardizing computational methods or calculation of meteorological variables, for example, are discussed and the impacts quantified: these are shown to be insignificant except for a few cases where conditions were extreme, and AirSeaFluxCode is shown to be robust. We also investigate the impact on the fluxes caused by different assumptions about the exchange processes, or the choices inherent in the implementation of the parameterizations. For example, sea surface temperature usually refers to data typically obtained at depths of between 1 and 10 m. However, since some parameterizations require a "skin" sea surface temperature, code that Frontiers in Marine Science frontiersin.org 01</p></div>

Selecting a parameterization that is appropriate for the available sea surface temperature will avoid the need to adjust the sea temperature data and the uncertainties associated with that adjustment, and will also avoid the biases due to use of the "wrong" measure of temperature. Significant differences also resulted from assumptions about the size of reduction in sea surface humidity to account for salinity effects: the uncertainty in the reduction factor needs to be quantified in future analyses. Fluxes in extreme conditions are particularly uncertain since the transfer coefficients in the different parameterizations vary most at very high and very low wind speeds. Low wind speeds are also challenging for numerical implementation since choices have to be made regarding: convergence criteria for the iterative calculation, inclusion of a parameterization for convective gustiness, or application of ad hoc limits to various parameters. All of these choices can significantly affect the flux estimates for light winds.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background &amp; requirements</head><p>Surface heat and momentum fluxes play an important role in the Earth's climate system, as they can affect large-scale circulation patterns in the atmosphere which in turn affect surface wind patterns which drive the general ocean circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cronin et al., 2019)</ref>. The quantification of heat (sensible and latent) and momentum fluxes in most applications relies on empirical parameterizations, often called bulk formulae, that relate the fluxes to relatively easily obtained mean variables such as near-surface wind speed, air and sea temperatures and humidity. These mean (or bulk) variables can be obtained from in situ measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berry and Kent, 2009)</ref>, satellite observations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bentamy et al., 2017)</ref> or from reanalysis model output fields (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bosilovich et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dee et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kobayashi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hersbach et al., 2020)</ref>. The parameterizations take one of two equivalent forms to represent the complexities of air-sea exchange, either using transfer coefficients or by defining surface roughness lengths. The parameterizations themselves usually derive estimates of these coefficients or roughness lengths from direct measurements of the fluxes (using, e.g. the eddy covariance method which requires very precise, fast response instruments) made concurrently with measurements of the mean or bulk variables. Direct measurements of the turbulent fluxes can be highly uncertain even when made with extreme care <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bradley and Fairall, 2006)</ref>, and are expensive and difficult to make so are therefore very sparse. The uncertainty inherent in direct turbulent flux measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bradley and Fairall, 2006)</ref>, and the limited extent to which they sample the range of important regimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yu, 2019)</ref>, places a limit on the accuracy of the bulk parameterizations derived using those measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Taylor, 2000)</ref>. As a result, there are large differences in the magnitude of the estimated turbulent surface fluxes (TSF) derived from different bulk formulae, particularly under high wind speeds when direct flux measurements are difficult to obtain, or very low wind speeds or in stable conditions when the underlying theory may not be applicable.</p><p>A commonly-cited requirement for climate applications is for global or basin-scale surface net fluxes on monthly to seasonal time scales to be better than 10 Wm -2 for the heat fluxes and 0.01 Nm -2 for the momentum flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Taylor, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bradley and Fairall, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu, 2019)</ref>. Requirements for other applications are summarized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bourassa et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cronin et al. (2019)</ref>. The net heat flux has four components: the turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes and the net shortwave and net longwave radiation. The uncertainty in each component therefore needs to be small. For uncorrelated errors, which may be a poor assumption, an uncertainty in each component smaller than 5 Wm -2 would meet this overall requirement. The shortwave and latent heat fluxes are usually substantially larger in magnitude than the longwave and sensible heat fluxes and component uncertainties in the range 2-7 Wm -2 may be sufficient to meet the net heat flux requirement. However, correlations in errors are very likely. For example, errors in the wind speed will affect both sensible and latent heat fluxes calculated from the bulk parameterizations, and errors in the cloud cover in models will affect both radiative components of the net heat flux <ref type="bibr">(Sanchez-Franks et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>A major source of uncertainty in the air-sea turbulent heat fluxes is the large differences in values specified for the transfer coefficients (or roughness lengths) in the different bulk formulae parameterizations. In addition to this there are significant uncertainties caused by the various choices made when implementing any given parameterization [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brodeau et al. (2017)</ref>] and by measurement errors or other sources of uncertainty in the input variables themselves [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bradley and Fairall (2006)</ref>]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brunke et al. (2003)</ref> examined the performance of twelve bulk flux parameterizations using ship-borne direct flux measurements and ranked them based on biases and uncertainties. They concluded that causes of poor performance included implementation issues such as the omission of convective gustiness (see Section 3.2.6 below) and the failure to include a reduction in the saturation vapor pressure to account for salinity (Section 3.2.4). More recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brodeau et al. (2017)</ref> compared TSF from COARE 3.0 with those derived from parameterizations used by The US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Large et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Large and Yeager, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Large and Yeager, 2009)</ref> and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forcasts (ECMWF), <ref type="bibr">(ECMWF, 2014)</ref>. They also ran sensitivity tests to understand which implementation choices caused the largest uncertainties in the derived fluxes. They found that most of the approximations that are common practice (e.g. constant values for air density and sea level pressure) have limited impact on the TSF when tested individually (in contrast to some of our findings in Section 3.2.1), but concluded that when approximations are considered in combination their impact can be more significant, producing zonal mean errors of up to 20%.</p><p>In this paper we present an open-source software package "AirSeaFluxCode" implemented in Python 3.6 (or higher) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Van Rossum and Drake, 2009)</ref> for the computation of surface turbulent fluxes of heat (latent and sensible) and momentum. Ten different parameterizations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are included, each based on published descriptions or code. AirSeaFluxCode also allows users to compare the effects of different implementation choices, something which is not possible with other available code.

"Valid range" is the range of wind speeds under which the developers indicated that their formulation was valid (normally the range of wind speeds in the data they used). Where this range is limited, the parameterization has been extrapolated as described in Section 2. Section 3 compares the implementation of parameterizations in the AirSeaFluxCode to code provided by algorithm developers, and quantifies the effect of various implementation choices on the resulting fluxes and on the height-and stability-adjusted meteorological variables. Our conclusions, recommendations and development plans for AirSeaFluxCode form Section 4. We use the term "parameterization" to refer to the combination of transfer coefficients, roughness lengths and stability parameters. We use "algorithm" to refer to the combination of the parameterization and the full calculation process or implementation. To aid discussion of the results we have provided a set of "significance" values chosen according to the above requirements for flux uncertainty along with an assessment of reasonable measurement uncertainties for the bulk variables, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>We follow the convention of a positive flux being a gain by the ocean, so incoming shortwave radiation is positive and the other heat flux components are usually negative (representing a heat loss by the ocean). A positive wind stress represents momentum transfer from the atmosphere into the ocean.</p></div>

The fluxes both depend on, and modify, these nearsurface atmospheric gradients. The atmosphere is typically slightly unstable as the sea is normally warmer than the air just above it. In these conditions turbulence is enhanced, mixing is increased and the vertical gradients are weaker than in neutral conditions. Conversely when the atmosphere is stable, turbulence is suppressed, mixing is weak and steeper gradients can exist. Low wind speed, stable conditions are associated with shallow surface layers as mixing is confined near to the surface: under such conditions the atmosphere at measurement height z (typically 20 m or more on a ship), may be above any constant flux layer and the flux theory will not be valid.</p><p>The values for the Y x functions derive from Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dyer, 1974)</ref> and are estimated from z/L, where L is the Monin-Obukhov Length.

For those algorithms that originally included a gustiness term, the values of b conv and z i are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The application of the gustiness term is not appropriate to all parameterizations, particularly those that were developed without it, since the impact on the TSF can be very large (Section 3.2.6). Details on how gustiness term is applied are given in Section 2.3. Some developers remove the effects of gustiness from some of the output parameters, but there is no consensus as to how to do this. Therefore in AirSeaFluxCode the user is provided with options to remove the effects of gustiness from some, all, or none of the TSF and u 10n and u zout (details in Section S4 and summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).

Some are designed for use with a bulk water temperature (typically made at depths of 1 to 10 m), whereas others require radiometric "skin" temperature, referred to here as the "cool skin" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Donlon et al., 2002)</ref>. These measures are not interchangeable, and each parameterization should be used with the measure of sea temperature used in its derivation. See Section 3.2.5 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Finally, many of the parameterizations discussed here are based on direct measurements of the fluxes along with measured, earth-relative wind speed, therefore such parameterizations require earth-relative winds as input. In these cases, the effects of surface currents are implicitly included in the parameterization. This might be reasonable for local winddriven currents but in regions where strong surface currents are not aligned with the prevailing winds, use of these parameterizations with earth-relative winds introduces additional uncertainties. In contrast, some parameterizations (e.g. C30 and C35) assume winds are relative to the ocean surface: in this case the user should input surface-relative winds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">AirSeaFluxCode calculation methodology 2.2.1 Transfer coefficients</head><p>Transfer coefficients are defined in one of two ways. Either the value of the coefficient at 10 m and in neutral atmospheric conditions is specified, or a roughness length is specified (z 0m for momentum, z 0t for temperature and z 0q for moisture) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). For the latter, transfer coefficients are calculated from the roughness lengths (Equations 3), and vice versa for the former.</p><p>Most of the uncertainty in the estimated TSF is due to the wide range of values assigned to the transfer coefficient or roughness lengths particularly at high and low wind speeds (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), since differences in the fluxes are directly proportional to differences in the transfer coefficients (Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>). It should be noted that LP82 and NCAR (based partly on LP82) define separate heat transfer coefficients for unstable and stable conditions.</p><p>The drag coefficients, and some parameterizations of the heat transfer coefficients, vary with wind speed (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). Some parameterizations (S80, LP82) were originally defined for the limited wind speed range over which direct measurements of the fluxes were obtained in the observational programs. These ranges are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. To apply these parameterizations to all wind speeds we have extrapolated the coefficient definitions at both low and high wind speeds (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). YT96 provided a drag coefficient in terms of u * : we convert their Equation 21 to a drag coefficient and extrapolate this at high wind speeds. This extrapolation, based on a polynomial fit, results in drag coefficients that decrease for winds over 30 ms -1 , and the authors advised against extrapolation. However, subsequent evidence (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Powell et al., 2003)</ref> supports such a decrease up to ~50 ms -1 and we therefore use this extrapolation here.</p></div>

AirSeaFluxCode estimates the transfer coefficients at the measurement height(s) and the stability-dependent flux profiles using an iterative method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Large, 1979)</ref>.

The saturation specific humidity at the sea surface (q 0 ) is calculated at the sea surface temperature applying a 2% salt reduction (Section 3.2.4).

In addition, in this comparison we have the highest percentage (1.66%) of data that failed using AirSeaFluxCode due to NCAR's use of two distinct values for the heat transfer coefficients in stable and unstable conditions (see Section 3.2.7 for details).</p><p>For the SSV, the ~0.02% of differences classed as significant in either T 10 or q 10 occurred under near neutral to stable conditions, while the 0.07% of data with significant difference in u 10n occurs for wind speeds below about 5 ms -1 , mostly under stable conditions for wind speeds below 2 ms -1 .</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S4</ref> shows another comparison where AirSeaFluxCode was temporarily modified to adopt the NCAR developers thermodynamical options and ad hoc limits. In this case no significant differences were seen in the heat fluxes or SSV, except for just 0.01% of u 10n data. The percentage of data that failed to converge decreases very slightly.</p><p>In the comparison with ECMWF we identified differences in methodological, thermodynamical and ad hoc limits in the implementations that can produce significant/major differences in TSF and SSV:</p><p>-Most differences are associated with wind speeds greater than 17 ms -1 , and are due to the ad hoc constraint in the Aerobulk code (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) that limits z 0m to a maximum value of 0.001 m. Over 1% of data showed significant or major differences in t; about 0.6% showed significant or major difference in lhf; 0.23% showed significant differences in shf.</p><p>-~8% of u 10n data show significant differences across all wind speeds, including 0.03% major differences under low wind speed conditions (&lt; 1 ms -1 ). These differences are largely due to the developer code calculating u 10n "bottom-up" with gust included, see Section S7.5 for more details.</p><p>Again Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S4</ref> shows a comparison where AirSeaFluxCode was temporarily modified to adopt the Aerobulk developers approach to implementing the ECMWF parameterization, including the ad hoc limits (described in more detail in Section S7.5). Applying the constraint on roughness lengths and stability functions, and using their definitions for c p and r 0 , removes all significant differences for the TSF and SSV, apart from u 10n . Applying the same approach to the calculation of the output u 10n (i.e. not removing the effects of gustiness) reduces the significant differences to just 0.01%. See Section S7.5 for further information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Summary of code comparisons</head><p>Comparisons of our code with the original developer code (in a variety of coding languages) for four different parameterizations has shown that the results from AirSeaFluxCode are robust.</p><p>In the case of UA and C35 no significant differences were found in the TSF nor in the adjusted SSV (where those data were available as output from the code).</p><p>For NCAR, significant differences were seen in a very small fraction (less than 0.1%) of lhf, u 10n , T 10 and q 10 data, usually under low wind speed conditions. No significant differences were seen in t. The shf results showed 0.2% significant differences due to the developer's choice of function for c p which resulted in a slight high bias in shf across all wind speeds.</p><p>For ECMWF, the developers' use of an upper limit to z 0m had by far the largest impact on the results and caused significant or major differences in all the TSF, particularly at the higher wind speeds. A small number of additional significant differences in the shf were due to the choices for the c p and r 0 parameters.</p><p>For most parameterizations, the very small fraction of data that failed to converge in AirSeaFluxCode were obtained under very low wind speed conditions. The exception to this was NCAR, where a relatively large proportion (1.66%) of data failed to converge in near-neutral conditions under moderate and high wind speeds. We examine convergence in more detail in Section 3.2.7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Quantification of the effects due to implementation options in the code</head><p>In the following subsections we test the impacts of the various implementation choices for: the acceleration of gravity; four thermodynamic variables; the Monin-Obukhov length; saturation vapor pressure; the 2% reduction of saturation specific humidity over the sea surface to account for the effect of salinity; gustiness; cool skin/warm layer adjustments. We use the significance classifications defined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and the ERA5-based test data set to examine the impacts of these choices on the fluxes and the height-and stability-adjusted SSV parameters.</p><p>The input option combinations used for the various tests are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">9</ref>. In general, gustiness, cool skin and warm layer options were turned off, except when those options were being tested. The values used for the constants in the gustiness term for each parameterization are given in square brackets corresponding to [option, b conv , z i , u gmin ]. Abbreviations refer to q meth : saturation vapour pressure function, L tsrv : L from equation 5, L Rb : L from equation 7, cskin: cool skin, cskwl: cool skin/warm layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Thermodynamic variables and acceleration due to gravity</head><p>The effect of using a constant approximation for gravity, rather than the functional form that depends on latitude (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), was negligible for all output parameters (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S6</ref>). The effect remained negligible when the test was repeated with 1) the ship based data set that contains variable measurement heights (ranging from about 10 m to 31 m) and 2) the reanalysis data setting the measurements heights up to 50 m (not shown).</p><p>The calculation of TSF uses several thermodynamic variables which do not always have a definitive method of calculation. Here we compare constant value approximations against the functional dependencies used in AirSeaFluxCode for: specific heat of moist air (c p ) as a function of specific humidity at the sea surface; latent heat of vaporisation (L v ) as a function of sea surface temperature; air density (r 0 ) as a function of pressure and; the dry adiabatic lapse rate (Г) as a function of c p (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). Using the constant value approximations significantly affects the TSF in some cases, but not the SSV.</p><p>c p scales the shf (Equation <ref type="formula">1b</ref>) but the effect on other outputs is negligible (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">S7</ref>). In the functional dependence, c p increases with q 0 . Setting c p to a constant (1020 J kg -1 K -1 , following Brodeau et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>)) means that in regions where specific humidity is relatively high (low) c p and hence the shf are underestimated (overestimated) compared to the functional form. Up to about 1% of data (depending on the parameterization) show significant differences in shf. Using a different functional form, such as that used in Aerobulk, can also lead to significant differences in shf in up to ~0.1% of data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">S8</ref>) compared to those from AirSeaFluxCode.</p><p>L v scales the lhf (Equation <ref type="formula">1c</ref>) and the effect on other outputs is negligible (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">S9</ref>). Neglecting the functional dependence of L v on T 0 (L v decreases with increasing air temperature) and using a constant value of (2.46 • 10 6 J kg -1 ) instead produces significant differences in lhf for about 10% of data. Use of this constant overestimates L v and hence lhf loss in the tropics by up to 4 Wm -2 and underestimates it at high latitudes by up to 3 Wm -2 (Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>), with a mean change of about +0.5 Wm -2 (c.f. +1.1 Wm -2 in Brodeau et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>)). r 0 varies systematically by nearly 20% across the globe, being lowest in the tropics and highest at high latitudes, and scales all of the TSF (Equations 1). Using a constant r 0 of 1.2 kg m -3 produces major changes in all of the TSF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S10</ref>). Use of a constant r 0 decreases t by 0.002 Nm -2 on average: up to 17% of data show a significant change and an additional ~2% show a major change. The maximum values of the changes are order 0.03 Nm -2 , and occur for t values of 0.57 to 0.69 Nm -2 , i.e. they represent a ~6% change of the flux. For the shf about 6.5% of data show significant changes and a further ~0.3% show major changes. Again the changes are skewed, with the use of a constant value decreasing the heat loss by the ocean. The maximum values of the changes are order -15 Wm -2 , and occur for shf values of -185 to -164 Wm -2 , i.e. they represent a ~9% change of the flux. The impact on the lhf is even greater, with up to 50% of data showing significant changes and a further 2% or more showing major changes. When a constant is used the tropics show an increased heat loss by the ocean of up to 15 Wm -2 , and high latitudes show a decreased heat loss of similar magnitude (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). These maximum changes occur at wind speeds greater than ~6 ms -1 , a wide range of stability conditions and represent up to a 6% change in lhf (maximum differences occur for lhf ranging approximately from -250 to -230 Wm -2 ).</p><p>If the different functional form of r 0 in Aerobulk is applied then no significant differences are seen, but the heat flux results are slightly skewed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S11</ref>).</p><p>Using a constant value for the dry adiabatic lapse rate Г has no effect on any of the TSF or SSV estimates (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S12</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Monin-Obukhov length</head><p>As described in Section 2.1 AirSeaFluxCode initializes the flux calculation using the bulk Richardson number <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grachev and Fairall, 1997</ref>)(Equation <ref type="formula">10</ref>) but includes two options for the calculation of the Monin-Obukhov length (L, Equations 5 and 7) during the iteration process. Originally, parameterizations S88, LP82, YT96 and NCAR follow the approach taken by S80 of using L tsrv at every step.

Left: histograms of the difference in latent heat flux, Dlhf= lh ffunction -lh fconstant (Wm -2 ) for the ten parameterizations in AirSeaFluxCode. Right: the global distribution of this difference using the S88 parameterization.</p><p>The choice of L formulation on t and shf leads to no significant differences (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S13</ref>) for the majority of parameterizations. The exceptions are YT96 where 0.01% of t values show significant differences; and NCAR and LP82 where just 0.04% and 0.01% of shf results respectively show differences classed as significant. These changes occur under moderate and high wind speeds and very near-neutral conditions and are caused by the use of different heat transfer coefficients for stable and unstable conditions (Section 3.2.7). For the lhf, C30, C35, ECMWF and Beljaars show no significant changes, and the other parameterizations show significant changes in less than 1% of data. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref> shows the small amount of data with significant changes typically occur underlow and moderate wind speeds, with the larger changes tending to occur during stable atmospheric conditions.</p><p>The choice of L functions has limited impact on the adjusted SSV u 10n and T 10n . For u 10n significant or major differences affect &lt; 0.1% of the data for all parameterizations. For UA T 10n has &lt; 0.3% significant or major differences and NCAR and S80 ≤ 0.1%. Differences for q 10n are slightly larger again: S80 and S88 have ≤ 1% significant or major differences, UA &lt;1% and others ≤ 0.3%. The resulting z ref /L stability values are compared in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>. For all parameterizations the vast majority (98% or more) of results lie within the range -5&lt; z/L&lt; +2.</p><p>For most parameterizations the choice of L function has little or no impact on the failure rate. However, for LP82 and NCAR the failure rates decrease considerably when L Rb is used: fail rates decrease from 0.99% to 0.03% for LP82 and from 1.66% to 0.18% for NCAR. For those two parameterizations the high failure rates when using L tsrv occur for data at moderate and high wind speeds when conditions are near-neutral (Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>), conditions under which most algorithms converge after just a few iterations (Section 3.2.7), and are caused by the use of different heat transfer coefficients for unstable and stable conditions. The UA parameterization is the only one to show an increase in failure rate (from 0.26% to 0.47%) when L Rb is used, since the UA stability functions are particularly sensitive to the value of L.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>).

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S6B</ref> uses the S88 parameterization to illustrate the changes in both lhf and q 0 as a function of atmospheric stability as indicated by DT. The largest changes occur under near-neutral conditions associated with larger wind speeds (not shown), and hence large absolute values of lhf.</p><p>It is no longer common practice to neglect the effect of salinity reduction on q 0 : none of the algorithms considered here neglects it but several examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brunke et al. (2003)</ref> did. However, there is uncertainty around the correct percentage reduction to use: we tested a range of reductions from 1.6% to 2.4% and quantified the effects relative to the typically-used 2% value (Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). The differences occur mainly in the tropics (Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref>) and are associated with high wind speeds (not shown). Use of a 1.9% or 2.1% value in the salt reduction term produced no significant differences in the lhf data. Reduction values of 1.8% or 2.2% give lhf differences that occasionally exceed our 2 Wm -2 significance threshold, and reduction values of 1.6% or 2.4% result in significant changes in approximately 50% of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Cool skin and warm layer adjustments</head><p>There are diurnally-varying temperature gradients (a "warm layer") just below the sea surface, particularly under low wind speed and sunny conditions, where temperatures at depth are lower than those closer to the surface. However, at the very surface of the ocean the "skin" (&lt;&lt; 1 mm thick) is typically cooler than the underlying water <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alappattu et al., 2017)</ref> (the "cool skin"). It is the temperature contrast across the air-skin interface that will control the exchange of heat. Some parameterizations (e.g. C30, C35, ECMWF, Beljaars) were developed using skin temperatures. To apply these parameterizations using input data that only includes bulk measurements of sea temperature (typically made at depths between about 1 and 10 m) both the warm layer and cool skin adjustment are necessary. These adjustments require measurements that resolve the diurnal cycle (at least hourly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cronin et al. (2006)</ref>) including additional input parameters of short and long-wave radiation and are a very simple representation of rather complex processes and therefore contain substantial uncertainty.</p><p>In contrast, many other parameterizations were developed using bulk sea temperature measurements (e.g. S80, S88, LP82, YT96, UA, NCAR). In this case the mean effect of any nearsurface gradients (warm layer or skin) is included in the parameterization and neither adjustment should be applied. If the available bulk measurement is at a different depth to that used in the derivation of the parameterization this will add additional uncertainty, but this effect is not usually considered.</p><p>The results below demonstrate the dramatic impact of using the "wrong" water temperature measurements, or applying an adjustment to the "wrong" parameterization. As noted above the formulation of the cool skin and warm layer adjustments are themselves uncertain, so the impacts below should be considered indicative. In AirSeaFluxCode the user inputs whether skin or bulk temperature is available: the skin temperature calculation (and optionally the warm layer calculation) is activated if the chosen parameterization requires it (e.g. C35 with bulk temperature indicated). If the parameterization and temperature are incompatible (e.g. S80 selected with skin temperature indicated) the code will provide an error message and stop.</p><p>In this section we examine: 1) two different formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Edson et al. (2013)</ref>, and ECMWF ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>)) for the cool skin adjustment (with the warm layer turned off in both cases, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">S17</ref>); 2) the impact of turning cool skin on versus off (with the warm layer turned off in both cases) to illustrate the impact of using the "wrong estimate" for surface temperature T 0 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">S18</ref>); and 3) the impact of turning warm layer formulation on vs off (with the cool skin on in both cases, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">S19</ref>).</p><p>For completeness, a direct comparison was made between AirSeaFluxCode and the C35 developer code, both with the skin adjustment turned on to check the implementation of that adjustment in AirSeaFluxCode. No significant differences were seen and more than 99.95% of TSF and SSV data showed merely negligible differences (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S5</ref>).</p><p>1. The choice of formulation for the cool skin adjustment (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Edson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">ECMWF, 2019, Table</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">S17</ref>) results in no significant changes to the calculated t and almost none to the shf (just 0.01% of data showed significant differences in shf for the ECMWF and Beljaars parameterizations only). For the lhf the results show significant changes (mostly negative) in 1.9% of data or less, resulting in a mean difference of about -0.2 Wm -2 i.e. a slight decrease in heat loss by the ocean. Less than 0.14% of data show significant changes to u 10n and up to 0.08% show major changes. The impact on q 10n or T 10n affects all or most parameterizations with less than 0.3% of major changes and less than 1.5% of significant changes.</p><p>2. Turning the cool skin adjustment off compared to turning it on (DX=X cskinOn -X cskinOff ) has no significant impact on t but a dramatic impact on the heat fluxes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">S18</ref>). For the shf, about 50% or more data show a significant change: omitting the cool skin effect increases the heat loss from the ocean by about 2 Wm -2 on average across the whole dataset, with the difference reaching up to ~5 Wm -2 in the 95 th percentile depending on parameterization. The impact on the lhf is even greater; about 50% of data show significant changes and an additional 15% to 27% of data show major changes. Turning the cool skin adjustment off increases heat loss from the ocean, by ~6 Wm -2 on average and up to 15 Wm -2 in the 95 th percentile depending on the parameterization. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> shows the changes seen in the S88 heat flux results (shf and lhf) against wind speed and DT (as an indication of atmospheric stability). The changes in both shf and lhf occur across all wind speeds, and are largest for the more unstable atmospheric conditions. Neglecting the cool skin adjustment also impacts the adjusted SSV. For u 10n ~0.7% of data show significant changes, with some parameterizations showing order 0.1% of data with major changes. For T 10n , up to about 10% of data show significant increases, and up to 0.1% show major changes. Neglecting the cool skin adjustment tends to decrease T 10n in the mean. For q 10n , 15 % to 23% of data show significant changes, with up to an additional ~0.5% showing major changes. Again the tendency is to decrease q 10n when the cool skin adjustment is turned off.</p><p>Applying the cool skin adjustment has little impact on the failure rates for most of the parameterizations. The failure rates do increase slightly for S80, S88, LP82 and NCAR but these parameterizations were developed for use with bulk T 0 and the application of the cool skin adjustment is not appropriate.</p><p>3. Applying the warm layer adjustment also impacts the heat fluxes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">S19</ref>), but to a lesser extent than neglecting the cool skin adjustment. The warm layer adjustment has minimal impact on t with &lt; 0.03% of data showing significant differences. For the shf, more than 5% of data show significant changes, with a mean increase of heat loss from the ocean of about 0.4 Wm -2 , and a change of -2.5 to -1.7 Wm -2 in the 5 th percentile depending on the parameterization. The lhf is affected to a lesser extent, with less than 3% of data showing a significant effect. There is a mean increase in heat loss from the ocean of about 0.1 Wm -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>, and changes of up to -1.1 Wm -2 in the 5 th percentile.</p><p>The warm layer adjustment also affects the adjusted-SSV.</p><p>For u 10n about 1.5% of data show significant effects, with up to an additional 0.3% showing major effects: the tendency is to increase u 10n , but not significantly in the mean. T 10n and q 10n show similar significant or major changes, with the changes tending to (insignificantly) decrease both parameters on average. Note that applying the warm layer adjustment tends to slightly decrease the impact of the cool skin adjustment, since the former reduces difference between temperatures at depth and at the skin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6">Gustiness</head><p>The default in AirSeaFluxCode is to exclude the gustiness term except for those parameterizations that were originally developed with such a term included (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, the user can over-ride the default and turn gustiness on or off for any parameterization. The user also has multiple options for removing the effects of the gustiness term from some or all output TSF, u 10n and u zout (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>). Here we quantify the impact that including the gustiness term has on TSF and SSV, and also examine the various approaches to removing the effects of gustiness, by performing a suite of tests. Unless stated otherwise, the following tests use the default values for the constants in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>, i.e. b conv =1.2, z i =600 m (as used by the developers of C30 and C35) and u gmin =0.01 ms -1 ; a. compare gustiness term off versus on using option 3 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>), i.e. the effects of gustiness are not removed from any TSF nor from u 10n or u zout , either during the iteration or after convergence. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S20</ref> b. gustiness term off versus on using option 1, i.e. the effects of gustiness are removed from t, u 10n and u zout following the approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fairall et al.

The gustiness term is justified as being required for the production of non-zero heat fluxes in very low wind speed, convective conditions. However, the term increases all the TSF, u * , u 10n and u zout across almost all wind speeds and produces skewed differences (Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>). Depending on the parameterization, between 1.5 and 4.3% of results show significant differences in t: these differences occur at moderate to high wind speeds. For shf up to about 0.3% of data show significant differences for all wind speeds up to about 20 ms -1 , and the mean bias is about 0.15 Wm -2 . For the lhf, up to 15% of data show significant differences across all wind speeds and the mean bias is about 1 Wm -2 (increased heat loss by the ocean). At very low wind speeds (&lt; 1 ms -1 ) some parameterizations also see major differences in lhf in up to 0.1% of data (maximum differences vary between about 10 and 30 Wm -2 , Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>). SSV are also affected, with T 10n and q 10n showing major differences up to 0.13% and 0.46% respectively. As expected, applying the gustiness term affects u 10n across the whole wind speed range (by 0.05 ms -1 on average). The largest increases occur at the low wind speeds:most parameterizations show 0.01-0.02% of data with major differences in u 10n for winds below about 1 ms -1 . For all parameterizations, applying the gustiness term slightly reduces the number of data that fail to converge.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S21</ref> shows the results of removing the effect of gustiness from t, u 10n and u zout using option 1 (test b). t is calculated from Equation S6c, u 10n and u 10 are calculated from the measured wind without the addition of the gustiness term and with u * reduced by a factor of ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi GF p (Equations S8b, S9b) in the iteration and after convergence. The number of significant differences seen in t are reduced to about 0.5% of data or less after gustiness effects are removed. No significant differences are seen in u 10n (Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). Although the effects of gustiness are not removed the heat fluxes directly, the results are not identical to those in the previous test due to the removal of gust effects from the wind speed variables: the differences are, however, very minor. In comparison to not removing the effects of gustiness, removing the effects increases the failure rate very slightly for most parameterizations: this is due to u 10n becoming negative in a few cases.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S22</ref> (test c) is the same as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S21</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure">S10</ref>) but in this case the heat fluxes have also had the effects of gustiness removed by dividing u * by ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi GF p in Equations S10b, S10c. This removes all significant differences in the shf results for most parameterizations with just 0.01% showing significant differences for ECMWF and Beljaars, and the mean bias is reduced to less than 0.01 Wm -2 . Similarly, almost all significant or major differences have been removed from the lhf comparison, and the mean bias is reduced to about 0.4 Wm -2 .</p><p>The choice of values for b conv equal 1 or 1.2 and z i equal to 1000 m or 600 m (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S23</ref>) has no significant effect on any of the TSF or adjusted SSV. For the lhf the differences are slightly skewed, with the default values increasing heat loss by the ocean by just 0.02 Wm -2 in the mean.</p><p>The test of the effect of setting minimum gust wind speed (u gmin , Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>) equal to 0.2 ms -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fairall et al., 2003)</ref> or the default in AirSeaFluxCode (0.01 ms -1 ) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S24</ref>, led to no significant changes in TSF or SSV. However, setting u gmin = 0.2 ms -1 slightly increases the failure rates, indicated by the number of points that fail to converge shown in the fail columns, for most parameterizations.</p><p>It should be noted that all tests were performed with input heights of 10 m for wind speed and 2 m for air temperature. The impact of including the gustiness term, and of removing the effects using the gustiness factor, are both influenced by the input measurement heights. For example, after removing gust effects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S21</ref>) significant differences were seen in t in up to 0.5% of data using a height of 10 m: using a height of 2 m increased the number of significant differences up to 5.5% (not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.7">Convergence and failure rates</head><p>This section examines failure rates across all results from the code comparisons and the various tests (Sections 3.1 and 3.2. <ref type="bibr">1-3.2.6</ref>). The failure rates given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> and Tables S7-S21 are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S25</ref>. "Failure" in AirSeaFluxCode is defined as either non-physical values for u 10n , T 10n or q 10n or lack of convergence after the maximum number of iterations has been reached (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref>): all tests used a maximum of 30 iterations (the default).</p><p>A direct comparison of failure rates between AirSeaFluxCode and the original developer codes could not be performed since the developers use a set number of iterations (either 5 or 10, Section 3.1) and assume convergence rather than testing for it. NCAR was the only developer code to output negative values of u 10n (just 0.04% of data)</p><p>To investigate the potential impact of limiting the number of iterations to 5 or 10 we used the outputs from AirSeaFluxCode from Section 3.1. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> shows the number of iterations required for convergence for different 10/L ranges. For the four algorithms considered (UA, C35, NCAR and ECMWF) the number of iterations required for convergence increases as conditions move further away from neutral, i.e. as |10/L| increases. For all four parameterizations, the vast majority of data with -2&lt; 10/L&lt; +2 converge within 5 iterations (the 0.7% of outlier data converge within 10 iterations, or 15 in the case of NCAR) but outside of this near-neutral stability range many more iterations may be needed depending on the parameterization. Note that in the NCAR and ECMWF developer codes the maximum number of iterations is 5. For NCAR, AirSeaFluxCode needed up to 30 iterations in conditions where 10/L&lt; -2. For ECMWF, AirSeaFluxCode needed 9 (11) or more iterations in very unstable (stable) conditions. In contrast, the developers code for UA and C35 sets the number of iterations to 10. For C35, almost all of the data in AirSeaFluxCode converged within this limit with only a few outliers needing 11 iterations when 10/L&lt; -20. Similarly, for UA only the most unstable data (10/L&lt; -20) needed more than 10 iterations, with outliers needing up to 30.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S25</ref> summarizes the "failure" rates for all tests. It can be seen that using a constant rather than a function for the acceleration of gravity, c p , L v , r 0 and Г has no impact on the failure rate, and neither does the method of calculating e s . Completely neglecting the 2% salt reduction of q 0 has little or no impact in the failure rates of most parameterizations, but increases the failure rate in LP82 and NCAR (although it should be noted that all of the 10 parameterizations do include the 2% reduction term).</p><p>The choice of method for Monin-Obukhov length has a mixed impact that differs according to the parameterization chosen: by far the biggest impact is the reduction in failure rates for LP82 and NCAR (falling from 0.99% to 0.03%, and from 1.66% to 0.18% respectively) when the L Rb method is chosen. The high failure rates in LP82 and NCAR when using L tsrv occurred under moderate to high wind speeds in nearneutral stability conditions (Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>) and were due to the use of distinct values for the heat transfer coefficients under stable and unstable conditions. Under near-neutral conditions the iteration may oscillate between stable and unstable conditions and coefficients, producing flux results that differ by more than the tolerance limits and hence preventing the iteration from converging. In contrast, the failure rate almost doubles for UA when the L Rb method is applied with the additional failed data occurring under stable conditions.</p><p>If we exclude the results for LP82 and NCAR when the L tsrv method is used, then Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref> shows that failures always occur under low wind speeds (less than about 5 ms -1 ) with atmospheric conditions that are very stable or very unstable. In the default versions of the algorithms (i.e. using L tsrv ), NCAR has the largest failure rates (1.66%), followed by LP82 (0.99%), YT96 (0.58%), UA (0.26%), S80 (0.09%), ECMWF (0.08%), Beljaars (0.08%), S88 (0.07%), and C30 and C35 (both 0.04%).</p><p>Applying the gustiness term and using the default (option 1) for removing the effects of gustiness from t and the wind speed parameters slightly decreases the failure rate for most parameterizations. The exceptions are S88 and LP82 where using option 1 increases their failure rate by generating negative values of u 10n due to over-correction at very low wind speeds. The user should be careful when choosing a value for u gmin since increasing the default value (0.01 ms -1 ) increases the failure rate (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S24</ref>).</p><p>The application of the cool skin/warm layer adjustment has a direct impact on the stability through the adjustment of DT at every iteration step; in near neutral conditions the adjustment can lead to changes between stable/unstable conditions. Boxplots of the number of iterations needed for convergence (in AirSeaFluxCode) relative to various stability ranges (10/L tsrv ), showing the median (orange line), the inter-quartile range (25-75%, box), the outer range (whiskers, &lt; 25% and &gt; 75% respectively). Outliers (0.7% of data) are shown as grey dots. The four parameterizations examined in Section 3.1 are shown. For UA, C35 and ECMWF gustiness is switched on selecting option 1 with b conv =1.2, z i =600 m and u gmin =0.01 ms -1 .</p><p>Applying the cool skin adjustment (only) following <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fairall et al. (1996a)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Edson et al. (2013)</ref> has very little impact on the failure rates for most of the parameterizations, with only marginal increases in failure for S80, S88 and C35. However, the increase in failure rates is larger for LP82 and NCAR which are more sensitive to shifts between un/stable conditions. When the warm layer adjustment is also applied, the increase in failure rates is removed. The application of the cool skin adjustment (only) following ECMWF (2019) has a similar impact on failure rates compared to applying the default (C35, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fairall et al., 1996a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Edson et al., 2013)</ref>: failure rates are marginally higher for some parameterizations and marginally lower for others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Summary of results</head><p>Section 3.2 describes in detail various comparisons and tests of AirSeaFluxCode using the ERA5 test dataset which contained data spanning a very wide range of wind speed and atmospheric stability conditions. The results are summarized here.</p><p>Section 3.2.1 examined the effect of approximating some thermodynamic variables as constant values rather than using their functional dependencies. The choice of the form of Г had no impact (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S12</ref>). For acceleration due to gravity, c p and L v , using a constant rather than the more accurate functional form had limited impact but the functional form is simple to calculate and should be used. In contrast, using a constant density of air had serious impacts across all wind speeds and stabilities, with systematic increase of heat loss in the tropics of order 10 Wm -2 , and systematic decrease of heat loss in higher latitudes also of order 10 Wm -2 . The constant approximation for air density should never be used.</p><p>Section 3.2.2 tested the default formulation for determining the Monin-Obukhov length (L tsrv ) against the alternative (L Rb ) and found differences in the lhf output that were significant in a few cases when wind speed was low and stability extreme. The differences in the resulting 10/L estimates are largest when |10/L| is large (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>) i.e. when the stability functions show the most variation between parameterizations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). L tsrv is the formulation normally favoured by algorithm developers. Use of L Rb enables data in near neutral, high wind speed conditions, to converge when using the LP82 and NCAR parameterizations: in these conditions L tsrv oscillates in sign throughout the iteration, causing selection of different values for the heat transfer coefficients and hence large changes in the heat fluxes between iterations which leads to a failure to converge.</p><p>Section 3.2.3 examined various formulations for saturation vapour pressure functions (e s ). No significant differences were found, but in the mean there was a systematic change in lhf of about 0.2 Wm -2 . Section 3.2.4 examined the impact of the 2% reduction in q to account for the salinity of sea water. If neglected entirely this would have a dramatic impact on the lhf, but that is no longer common practice. However, there is uncertainty in the correct percentage to use: if the 2% term is replaced by 1.8% or 2.2% then the lhf begins to see significant changes; if replaced by 1.6% or 2.4% significant changes occur in about 50% of the lhf results.</p><p>Section 3.2.5 examined the impact of applying the cool skin and warm layer adjustments. It was noted that some parameterizations were developed based on bulk sea temperature measurements made at depths of about 1 m or more, whereas others were developed based on "skin" temperature data (either from radiometric measurements or modelled). If the input temperatures are bulk measurements then either (a) a parameterization based on such data should be used or (b) both the cool skin and the warm layer adjustments should be applied if using a parameterization that was developed using skin temperature. These adjustments have a dramatic effect on the heat fluxes: for the shf about 50% of data show significant changes; for the lhf more than 47% show significant changes and a further ~20% or more show major changes. The parameterization should therefore be chosen carefully with regard to the available input data.</p><p>Section 3.2.6 examined the use of the gustiness term (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>). This term is included in some parameterizations in order to produce non-zero heat fluxes under very low wind speed, convective conditions. However, its use impacts all the fluxes across all wind speeds. For this reason the effects of the gustiness term are usually removed from t (and also from u 10n as the default in AirSeaFluxCode and all developer codes except ECMWF) after the iteration has converged using a gustiness factor, but some significant differences still remain. As expected, the application of the gustiness term increases the heat fluxes but the impacts are seen at moderate and high winds as well as under low winds speeds. For the shf significant differences are seen for wind speeds up to 20 ms -1 , with an increased heat loss from the ocean of about 0.15 Wm -2 on average. For lhf, significant differences are also seen across all wind speeds, with a mean increase of heat loss of about 1 Wm -2 . At low wind speeds the lhf sees major differences, with increased heat loss of nearly 3 Wm -2 in the 5 th percentile, and maximum changes of between 10 and 30 Wm -2 depending on the parameterization. As expected, applying the gustiness term slightly decreased "failure" rates with the exception of S88 and LP82 where the rates increased slightly (using the default option 1).</p><p>In Section 3.2.7, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S25</ref> combined results from the above tests to examine the "failure" rates in AirSeaFluxCode where "failure" is defined as; non-physical u 10n , T 10n or q 10n results; lack of convergence after 30 iterations. Across all comparisons and tests, the rates are either small (less than about 0.5%) or, in the case of the LP82 and NCAR parameterizations, can be reduced to &lt; 0.5% by choosing L Rb (see Section 3.2.7). In general, data fail under low wind speeds and large |10/L|. Failure rates are increased by any discontinuities in the algorithm, e.g. different transfer coefficients for un/ stable conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>AirSeaFluxCode is an open source software package that calculates the turbulent air-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and latent heat from mean meteorological and sea surface parameters. It also adjusts the mean meteorological parameters to a user-defined output height and also outputs 10 m neutral values. To date, it includes ten different existing bulk formulae parameterizations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The choice of parameterization has by far the biggest impact on the calculated fluxes due to the wide range of values assigned to the transfer coefficients and/or roughness lengths. AirSeaFluxCode allows these differences to be easily examined without the need to implement the various developer codes or write new code for parameterizations that lack publicly available code.</p><p>AirSeaFluxCode was tested against the available code provided by the developers of four of the ten bulk parameterizations. A few significant or major differences were found in the flux results in the comparison with the developer code for ECMWF and NCAR. In general these differences were due to different choices made in the calculation of basic functions (e.g. r 0 , c p ), limits applied to basic parameters (e.g. u 10n , z 0m ) and the assumption of convergence after just 5 iterations in the developer code: we demonstrated that up to 30 iterations were required for convergence under very stable or unstable atmospheric conditions. In contrast, for UA and C35 there were no significant differences in the flux results. In general the agreement between AirSeaFluxCode and the developer codes was excellent which provides confidence that AirSeaFluxCode functions as expected and is robust.</p><p>The flux results from any individual parameterization can be significantly affected by the choices made in order to implement it. AirSeaFluxCode includes a wide range of implementation options (e.g. method of calculating the Monin-Obukhov length, gustiness, cool skin etc.) so that the sensitivity of the fluxes to these options can also be explored. In this paper we have used AirSeaFluxCode to quantify the impact of some of these options on the fluxes, and on the height-and stability-adjusted meteorological parameters u 10n , T 10n and q 10n .</p><p>As a result of the sensitivity tests made in this paper we can make the following recommendations:</p><p>The functional forms of air density, latent heat of evaporation and specific heat capacity (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>) should be used, since approximating these variables by constant values leads to significant and/or systematic errors.</p><p>The user should choose parameterizations and/or implementation options appropriate to their input data, otherwise there may be unintended, significant impacts on the calculated fluxes. Some parameterizations were developed using particular input data, e.g. wind speeds relative to surface currents (rather than earth-relative), or a sea surface "skin" temperature rather than a bulk temperature. If a parameterization requires particular variables but instead the user substitutes an estimate, or an inappropriate variable (such as bulk temperature instead of skin temperature), then the errors and uncertainty in the calculated fluxes etc. will be substantially increased.</p><p>The limit on the maximum number of iterations allowed should be chosen with care. For typical open ocean conditions the calculations rapidly converge but under low wind speeds when conditions are either very unstable or very stable, the calculations may require many iterations to converge. Under extreme conditions convergence may not be possible since the theory underpinning the calculations is at, or even beyond, the limits of its applicability: all ten parameterizations failed to converge for a very small fraction of data even after 30 iterations. Values calculated under such conditions will be highly uncertain, but if a zero failure rate is required then the user has the option to output all data, with flags to indicate where data has not converged or where the results may be non-physical.</p><p>Discontinuities in the underlying functions should be avoided. For example, the use by LP82 and NCAR of distinct values for the heat transfer coefficients in stable and unstable conditions meant that near-neutral data did not converge when used with the default L tsrv method of calculating the Monin-Obukhov length. Such near-neutral data usually converge very quickly but in these two parameterizations the iteration oscillated between two values with differences that exceeded the tight tolerance criteria imposed in the test for convergence.</p><p>The reduction factor for saturation vapor pressure due to salinity needs to be better constrained and its uncertainty established. It is important to include the effects of salinity when calculating the saturation vapor pressure. The reduction value typically used is 2.0%, but an uncertainty of just 0.2 (i.e. a value of either 1.8 or 2.2%) has a significant impact on the latent heat fluxes.</p><p>The impact of using ad hoc constraints as often used in the original developer code (e.g. setting a lower limit on wind speed or constraining the value of the Monin-Obukhov length etc), should be carefully evaluated. Such constraints may enable an algorithm to avoid producing un-physical outputs in extreme conditions, but can have significant impacts on the resulting fluxes and height-and stability adjusted meteorological parameters.</p><p>The impact of including the effects of convective gustiness in a parameterization, should be carefully evaluated. Including gustiness is usually justified in terms of producing non-zero heat fluxes at low wind speeds, but it significantly increases those fluxes under moderate and high wind speeds as well. The gustiness term also produces significant increases in the momentum flux and u 10n at all wind speeds: various approaches are taken to removing (or reducing) these effects from those output parameters but significant differences remain in the momentum flux at high wind speeds for most parameterizations. In addition, when the effects of gustiness are removed from the output TSF some other parameters become inconsistent with each other. In particular, the values output for u * retain the impacts of the gustiness term, and are inconsistent with the output momentum flux. Similarly, if the effects of gustiness were removed from u * (by applying the gust factor), it would no longer be consistent with the output drag coefficients. The application of a gustiness parameterization is often thought to improve convergence of the iterative calculation but the improvement is very small in most parameterization and for others the convergence rate actually decreases slightly.</p><p>Our code was designed to allow easy exploration of the different bulk formulae parameterizations and the wide range of implementation options. A high standard was set for the output data in that strict tolerance criteria were set when testing if the iteration had converged. This means that the code may be more computationally demanding than some applications require. To some extent this can be addressed by the user by relaxing the tolerance criteria, or reducing the maximum number of iterations allowed, but this would have to be weighed against the increased uncertainty in the results. Similarly, the default setting in our code is to set data that have not converged, or have produced non-physical values, to absent. Again, if this is unsuited to a particular application the user can output all data, flagged as appropriate.</p><p>We intend to regularly expand and update the code. Our priorities will be: to include new parameterizations that are published; to extend the calculations to include parameterizations that incorporate the effects of sea state; and, to develop and incorporate uncertainty estimates to accompany the calculations. We welcome collaboration on the development of the software package, as well as any bug reports, corrections or comments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIGURE 2 Stability functions versus z ref /L tsrv (A, B) for momentum, Y m , and (C, D) heat, Y t , for all bulk parameterizations provided in AirSeaFluxCode.
