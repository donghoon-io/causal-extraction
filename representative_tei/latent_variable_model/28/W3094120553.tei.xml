<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -This paper aims to explore the influence of collective orientation (CO) on coordination and team performance for interdependently working teams while controlling for person-related and team variables.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach -A total of 58 two-person-teams participated in a simulation-based firefighting task. The laboratory study took 2 h for each team. The effects of CO in tasks of increasing complexity were investigated under the consideration of control variables, and the relations between CO, coordination and team performance were assessed using a multivariate latent growth curve modeling approach and by estimating indirect effects in simple mediation models.</p><p>Findings -Team members high on CO performed significantly better than low-scoring members. The effect of CO on team performance was independent from an increasing task complexity, whereas the effect of CO on coordination was not. The effect of CO on team performance was mediated by coordination within the team, and the positive relation between CO and performance persists when including group efficacy into the model.</p><p>Research limitations/implications -As CO is a modifiable person-related variable and important for effective team processes, additional research on factors influencing this attitude during work is assumed to be valuable.</p><p>Practical implications -CO is especially important for highly interdependently working teams in highrisk-organizations such as the fire service or nuclear power plants, where errors lead to severe consequences for human beings or the environment.</p><p>Originality/value -No other studies showed the importance of CO for coordination and team performance while considering teamwork-relevant variables and the interdependence of work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Correspondingly, to the increased implementation of team-based structures in organizations over the past decades, research on teams has increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jones et al., 2019)</ref>. Such research aims to foster the understanding of the factors that contribute to team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mathieu et al., 2017)</ref>. Team composition factors such as task structure or team size, team members' personality and values, as well as their knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA) are critical elements in relation to team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Antoni and Hertel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mathieu et al., 2017)</ref>. Although personality and values show relations to team performance, KSA-based approaches predict team performance more reliably <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Stevens and Campion, 1994)</ref>. While KSAs can be influenced by training, personality traits and values cannot <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell, 2007)</ref> or to a smaller amount. A teamwork-relevant attitude that facilitates teamwork processes and positively affects the success of teams appears to be the collective orientation (CO) of each team member <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010)</ref>. CO is defined "as the propensity to work in a collective manner in team settings" (p.317); people who are high in CO enjoy working with others in a goal-oriented manner, seek others' input, contribute to team outcomes and enjoy team membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010)</ref>. As CO is defined as an attitude, it may vary by means of teamwork-related prior experience or by training and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eby and Dobbins, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Driskell et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The positive influence of CO on team performance appears to unfold particularly in complex interdependent teamwork contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagemann, 2017)</ref>. This finding is similar to the varying strength of the relationship between team efficacy and team performance depending on differing levels of interdependence among team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gully et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stajkovic et al., 2009)</ref>. So far there is no detailed information about an effect of teamwork context's complexity on the relationship between CO and team performance. Especially if this relation becomes stonger with an increase in complexity.</p><p>Teamwork research distinguishes goal, outcome and task interdependence, which are in accordance with general process models of human action <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hertel et al., 2004)</ref>. Task interdependence affects the interaction between team members directly, as the actions of one member have strong implications for the work process of all members <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Campion et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hertel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Shea and Guzzo, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Albeit interdependence is a defining attribute of teams <ref type="bibr">(Salas et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">van de Ven et al., 1976)</ref> and often the reason why teams are formed, different levels of task interdependence from independent/pooled, sequential, reciprocal to intensive interdependence are distinguished <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arthur et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">van de Ven et al., 1976)</ref>. Intensive interdependence requires coordination patterns (van de <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ven et al., 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Wageman, 1995)</ref>, calls for mutual adjustments as well as frequent interaction and information integration within the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stajkovic et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of CO on team performance and its importance in team research, the team task in the present study shows intensive interdependence.</p><p>Many teams working highly interdependently do not exist for a long time interval and have no time to live through different teamwork phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tuckman, 1965)</ref>. For example, team members of airline crews, staff work or operating room teams change their composition from shift to shift, respectively, from incident to incident. Furthermore, because of their responsibility for the lives of others as well as their own lives, they have to work effectively and reliably from the outset (see, e.g. high-responsibility or high-reliability teams; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hagemann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Salas and Rosen, 2013)</ref>. Thus, we argue that it is important to support their teamwork processes best to foster reliable and well-orchestrated team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Parker et al., 2018)</ref>. In that respect, we focus on CO as an individual contribution to teamwork processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sonnentag and Volmer, 2009)</ref> and thus relevant for optimal team performance in interdependent contexts.</p><p>Although single results concerning the influence of CO on team performance exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagemann, 2017)</ref>, we analyze not only the influence of CO on team performance, but also its effect on team coordination and the team process, while considering control variables. Therefore, we applied a laboratory-based approach with a computer-based simulation. This simulation is a so called micro-world representing complex and interdependent work situations and seems very promising for reliable and valid team research under standardized conditions. The purpose of the manuscript is first to strengthen the findings that CO contributes to successful teamwork and coordination in interdependent team contexts. Second, we examined the effect of CO on team performance and team coordination as a function of an increase in the complexity of the task while controlling for other variables. Third, we analyzed the underlying processes supporting teamwork and tested the indirect effect of CO on team performance mediated by the teams' coordination behavior. Fourth, we sought, on the one hand, to strengthen the unique finding that the effect of group potency on team performance vanishes when controlling for group efficacy, whereas simultaneously, on the other hand, in this interdependent team task, the effect of CO on team performance persists, so that CO shows incremental validity.</p><p>Collective orientation and its impact on coordination and team performance Team performancein research, also often used synonymously with team productivitymeans the extent to which a team or group accomplishes its mission and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell, 2007)</ref>. Team performance depends on various factors. Classical input-process-outcome (IPO) models link input factors, such as individual characteristics, e.g. knowledge, skills or attitudes, task and group characteristics as well as environmental factors to team processes, such as communication or coordination, which in turn influence the team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Antoni and Hertel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Campion et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hackman, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mathieu et al., 2008)</ref>. Based on these models, team composition receives high attention in team research as it seems that the configuration of member attributes in a team is thought to powerfully influence team processes and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Salas et al., 2005)</ref>. One of these member attributes is the CO.</p><p>CO is defined as an attitude that enhances team performance through coordination, evaluation and consideration of task inputs from other team members while performing a team task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Driskell and Salas, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Salas et al., 2005)</ref>. It is assumed, that collectively oriented people adapt teamwork processes adequately to the affordances of the situation and use available resources in due consideration of the team's goals effectively. They enjoy working in teams when teamwork supports task accomplishment and achievement of objectives. Nevertheless, they are also able to work effectively on their own. CO appears to be a predictor of individual contributions to team performance (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sonnentag and Volmer, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Driskell et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagemann (2017)</ref> provided a sound overview of the evidence of construct validity as well as convergent and discriminant validity of CO compared to other teamwork-related constructs. Studies analyzing collectively and non-collectively oriented persons' decision-making processes showed that teams with noncollectively oriented members performed poorly in problem-solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Driskell and Salas, 1992)</ref>. In contrast, collectively oriented members judged inputs from teammates as more valuable and considered these inputs more frequently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Karau and Williams (1993)</ref> extended expectancy-value models of effort to collective contexts and specified how working in a team influences team members' perception of the relation between their effort and expected outcomes. With regard to their collective effort model (CEM), it seems that team members with high CO values are more willing to exert effort on a team task and are therefore more successful. These people seem more likely to recognize that their individual efforts are relevant in obtaining valued outcomes. Based on the CEM, the relation between CO and team performance might be founded on the factors, that team members with high CO values seem more likely to see the connection between their effort and team performance (expectancy). Furthermore, they see the link between team performance and valued outcomes (instrumentality) and they recognize the outcome as desirable (valence). These mechanisms may explain the above reported single empirical findings so far.</p><p>Further, as introduced above, CO is assumed to enhance team performance as the team's coordination is improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Driskell and Salas, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Salas et al., 2005)</ref>. Coordination refers to the orchestration of the sequence and timing of interdependent actions within a team <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Marks et al., 2001)</ref>. In the past, CO was equated to team-oriented or collective behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Driskell and Salas, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Miles, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Watson et al., 1998)</ref>, and aspects such as information sharing, supporting others and mutual error correction were used as indicators. These indicators of collective behavior should support cooperation and coordination in teams. This hypothesized relationship is strengthened by the finding that team member value collectivismas a related constructhas been found to increase cooperation in teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kirkman and Shapiro, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wagner, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eby and Dobbins (1997)</ref> demonstrated that CO enhances coordination among team members and assumed it may boost team performance through strategizing, information sharing and goal setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Salas et al., 2005)</ref>, but did not prove that.</p><p>Moreover, research has shown that a positive relation between CO and team performance depends on the task type <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(McGrath, 1984)</ref>. Significant positive relations were only found in conjunction with the task types decision-making/choosing and negotiating <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagemann, 2017)</ref>, and not with generating or executing tasks. These first mentioned task types are characterized by much more interdependence than generating or executing tasks. The CEM model and these single studies, focusing either on coordination or on performance, indicate that teams containing members with high CO values might be more successful in their teamwork processes or in task accomplishment than teams with more individualistic and dominant people. To replicate, but especially combine the results from single studies, we developed the following hypotheses. The first hypotheses are as follows:</p><p>H1a. Teams containing members with high CO values show a significantly higher team performance in an interdependent task than teams containing members with low CO values.</p><p>H1b. Teams containing members with high CO values show significantly better team coordination in an interdependent task than teams containing members with low CO values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of relationships in consideration of complexity and coordination as the mediating variable</head><p>The first two hypotheses aim at investigating the general influence of CO as a team member attribute on team processes and outcomes, in an intensive interdependent team task. Yet, it is not a realistic depiction of work practices to assume these relationships to be independent from each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hackman, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mathieu et al., 2008)</ref>. Additionally, interdependence is a continuum rather than a static condition and it is thus indispensable to consider the influence of varying levels of interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beal et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wood, 1986)</ref>. Relevant team factors such as team efficacy have been shown to exert higher influences on performance in situations with increased interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gully et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stajkovicet al., 2009</ref>). Yet, these dynamic influences have to be deciphered for CO as a relevant input factor. So far, two studies were able to show that the impact of CO on team performance appears to unfold particularly in interdependent teamwork contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagemann, 2017)</ref>. The present study goes beyond this and also varies the degree of interdependence of the team task, in four steps, to analyze if the influence of CO on team performance and coordination is stronger for more interdependent tasks.</p><p>To create intensive interdependent tasks that require more or less coordination patterns, the extent of the task's complexity, leading to varying degrees of interdependence, can be manipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mathieu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wood, 1986)</ref>. Complex situations are characterized by element interactivity/interconnectedness, dynamic developments, non-transparency and multiple goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Funke, 1995)</ref>. As complex situations are not transparent, information may be missing, may be incorrect or may already be outdated when it reaches the decision-maker. The interconnectedness of people must be considered, so that, for example, one person can only perform an action when he/she has received information from the other person. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wood (1986)</ref> calls this facet coordinative complexity and means the degree to which task variables need to be integrated between team members with regard to timing, frequency and intensity. Furthermore, the situations can develop dynamically and at a high speed. The people involved do not necessarily receive direct feedback on their actions, so that they have to wait and see, anticipate future conditions and take them into account in their further actions. They pursue different and possibly competing goals simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dunne et al., 2010)</ref>. These multiple facets of complex tasks place high information processing and behavioral demands on team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chen et al., 2001)</ref>. The manipulated complexity of the present study is described in more detail in the Method section.</p><p>Regarding the above-mentioned demands, high-quality coordination in teams is important for the prompt sharing of information, resources and effort between members in a reciprocal manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ellington and Dierdorff, 2014)</ref>. The intra-team interaction such as mutual adjustments and frequent information integration within the team supports discussions of what is working for the team and what is not working and how the team members might adapt their teamwork strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ellington and Dierdorff, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Parker et al., 2018)</ref> and becomes more important for effective teamwork as the task's interdependence increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(DeChurch and Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marks et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stajkovic et al., 2009)</ref>. People with high CO values seem to be more motivated to invest their efforts in this intra-team interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eby and Dobbins, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Karau and Williams, 1993)</ref>. Thus, we assume that the positive relationships between CO and team performance and coordination are influenced by the degree of the task complexity, because of their described demands on team members' actions:</p><p>H2a. The positive relationship between CO and team performance is becoming stronger with an increase in the complexity of the task.</p><p>H2b. The positive relationship between CO and team coordination is becoming stronger with an increase in the complexity of the task.</p><p>Based on the IPO framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hackman, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mathieu et al., 2008)</ref>, coordination will be analyzed as a team process variable, and it can be influenced by individual characteristics such as knowledge or attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cannon-Bowers et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hackman, 1987)</ref>. CO as a team members' attitude appears to influence coordination and team performance positively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eby and Dobbins, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Driskell and Salas, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagemann, 2017)</ref> and the amount of high-quality coordination in a team correlates positively with the team's effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dierdorff et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Stevens and Campion, 1994)</ref>. To identify how CO is able to impact team performance, the underlying mechanisms, such as teamwork processes, need to be further analyzed. Therefore, we focus simultaneously on coordination and on performance and predict that the positive influence of CO on team performance is an indirect effect and is mediated by team processes, which is the coordination among the members of the team.</p><p>H3. The effect of CO on team performance is mediated by the teams' coordination performance; thus, there is an indirect effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of relationships in consideration of control variables</head><p>The impact of CO on team performance and coordination is analyzed in conjunction with control variables, as these may affect the relationships being investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bernerth and Aguinis, 2016)</ref>. We identified three potentially relevant control variables. The first two are specific to the experimental procedure. The team task in the study is a computer-based simulation. Although computers and other electronic devices are pervasive in our everyday lives, people show different attitudes to their use, and sometimes even an aversion to using a computer. Computer aversion means "a negative affective state (discomfort or apprehension) relating to computer technology" <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Schulenberg and</ref><ref type="bibr">Melton, 2008, p. 2621)</ref>. Thus, within the scope of a computer-based team task, positive attitudes to using a computer might positively influence the motivation for task accomplishment. Moreover, it might be able to minimize a potential fear of working with the simulation environment, and therefore contribute to the performance in the computer-based team task. As none of the participants in the present study were familiar with operating the simulation, initial training concerning the rules of the game and handling of the simulation was required. As people who have learned more during training might be more successful in task accomplishment, the amount of task-specific knowledge after training might influence the teams' performance.</p><p>One study indicates that team members' need for cognition (NFC) might also affect team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kearney et al., 2009)</ref>. NFC describes an individual's tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking. It explains individual differences in intrinsic cognitive motivation, which means how individuals are cognitively engaged and how they elaborate social and nonsocial information from their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cacioppo et al., 1996)</ref>. People high in NFC prefer complex over simple tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cacioppo and Petty, 1982)</ref>; they show deeper information processing and higher memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cacioppo et al., 1983)</ref> and actively search for new information <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Verplanken et al., 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kearney et al. (2009)</ref> showed that team members' NFC was positively associated with team performance, as rated by team leaders. Thus, it might be assumed that team members high in NFC are more motivated to find solutions to challenging problems and to accomplish demanding tasks, and therefore show a better performance in a team context, than people low in NFC. Thus, we control for the influences of these three variables when investigating the effect of CO on team performance and team coordination according to an increase in the complexity of the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships between collective orientation, emergent states and team performance</head><p>Analyses of the relationship between CO and emergent states <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(DeChurch and Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marks et al., 2001)</ref>, such as group potency and group efficacy and outcomes such as team performance, are rather lacking and are assumed to be considered more thoroughly (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dierdorff et al., 2011)</ref>. CO as an attitude can serve as an input variable, but also an emergent state, as it is able to change during teamwork based on experiences or training. Emergent states symbolize team members' motivations or attitudes and are "properties of the team that are typically dynamic in nature and vary as a function of team context, inputs, processes, and outcomes" <ref type="bibr">(Marks et al., 2001: 357)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Marks et al. (2001, p. 358)</ref>, emergent states can be considered as input variables as well as proximal outcomes as "they are products of team experiences and become new inputs to subsequent processes and outcomes." Instead of calling these variables traits, they prefer emergent states because of their mutable qualities. These entities also characterize CO. Studies either reside such variables at the individual or team levels of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mathieu et al., 2017)</ref>. For team effectiveness, both emergent states and interaction processes are relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kozlowski and Ilgen, 2006)</ref>. Emergent states dynamically enable effective teamwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(DeChurch and Mesmer-Magnus, 2010)</ref> and can be discriminated from team process, which refers to "members' interdependent acts that covert inputs to outcomes through cognitive, verbal, and behavioral activities directed toward organizing task work to achieve collective goals" <ref type="bibr">(Marks et al., 2001, p. 357)</ref>.</p><p>As the positive relations between group efficacy and group potency with team performance are empirically proved <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stajkovic et al., 2009)</ref>, also under consideration of varying inter-dependence, it is of interest for us, if the effect of CO on team performance is strong enough when controlling for these two widely researched emergent states. In line with the assumption made in H3 regarding CO and team process (coordination), also group efficacy and group potency facilitate the execution of behavioral processes (e.g. planning, coordination, backup behavior) during action phases, meaning during episodes when members are involved in actions that focus on task work and goal accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Marks et al., 2001)</ref>. These behavioral processes, in turn, represent the team members' interdependent actions that transform inputs to outcomes, such as team performance.</p><p>Group efficacy means the shared belief in the team's capability to effectively perform a specific task <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baker, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bandura, 1997)</ref>.

It is related to group goals and group effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Prussia and Kinicki, 1996)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 116 undergraduate and graduate students studying applied cognitive and media sciences participated in the study (79 females). Their mean age was 21.17 years (SD = 3.11).</p><p>In total, 58 two-person teams were generated, by matching participants as team mates based on the pre-measured CO values (see procedure).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The laboratory study was conducted at a university department for business psychology.</p><p>Prior to the experiment's start, the participants filled in the CO instrument online (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The sample was subsequently dichotomized into two groups via median split (Md = 3.12; range: 1.69-4.06; scale range: 1-5) relating to the variable CO. Interdependent team task C 3 Fire is a promising simulation-based task <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Granlund et al., 2001)</ref> and described as an intensive interdependence team task <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arthur et al., 2005)</ref>. C 3 Fire is a command, control and communications simulation environment, which allows analyzing the teams' coordination and communication in dynamic environments. It is a micro-world, as significant features of the real world are transferred to a small and well-controlled simulation system. The task environment in C 3 Fire is complex. That means people strive for (contradictory) goals and the system processes are coupled, so that side effects of an action occur and force people to choose between different courses of action. The micro-world is dynamic, as "their current state is a function of the history of the interaction between the subject and the system" and "they change, both as a consequence of the subject's actions and autonomously" <ref type="bibr">(Brehmer and Dörner, 1993, p. 173)</ref>. Because performed activities effect the ongoing procedure, the sequencing of activities is free and not stringent, such as a fixed (if A than B) or parallel (if A than B and C) sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Ormerod et al., 1998)</ref>. This can cause demanding conditions. The micro-world is also opaque, as people cannot collect all relevant information, so that they have to form and test hypotheses. Based on these characteristics, C 3 Fire is comparable to the tasks people typically come upon in real-life settings, in and outside their working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brehmer and Dörner, 1993)</ref>. Considering these facts, teamwork and performance can be examined within wellcontrolled laboratory studies. Micro-worlds such as C 3 Fire are able to bridge the gap between field studies, which have been criticized because of their small amount of control, and laboratory studies, which might show deficits regarding ecological validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brehmer and Dörner, 1993)</ref>. In C 3 Fire, the teams are responsible for protecting houses and saving lives and they have to coordinate their high interdependent actions to extinguish forest fires. The simulation contains, e.g. forest fire/s, houses, tents, gas tanks, varieties of vegetation and computersimulated agents such as firefighting units <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Granlund, 2003)</ref>. The teams in the current simulation scenarios were two-person teams and consisted of two firefighting units, one mobile water tank unit (accountable for re-filling the firefighting units' water tanks that they carry with them) and one fire-break unit (a field defended with a fire-break cannot be ignited; the fire spreads around its ends). Four scenarios were developed in total (each lasting for 15 min). Each team member was responsible for the same two units in all scenarios, either firefighting and water tank unit or firefighting and fire-break unit. The user interface was a map system (40 Â 40 square grid) with geographic information and positions of all symbols representing tents, gas tanks, hospitals, fire-break unit and so on. The simulation was run on desktop computers networked in a client-server configuration. Communication happened by means of a chat system.</p><p>Items of complexity. For complexity reasons, subjects had a restricted visibility field. All parts of the map with buildings and vegetation were noticeable for them, but not the burning cells or other units; instead, the subjects were close to them with their own units. Examples of the C 3 Fire simulation are provided in the Appendix in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">A1-A3</ref>. Table <ref type="table">B1</ref> in the Appendix shows complete information concerning the scenarios' characteristics and therefore differences, demonstrating the increasing complexity. For the sake of clarity, only the changes in complexity are described here, but not all the variables have remained constant across the scenarios and have no effect on an increase in complexity. The size of the visibility field in Scenario 1 was 5 Â 5 cells and changed to 3 Â 3 cells in Scenario 2. From then on, it was kept constant. This led to increased demands on the tactical arrangements within the team. In the third scenario, a second fire was added. This led to the fact that the team members had to coordinate themselves even better and also had to split up and keep up to date. The fourth scenario had also two fires, but now the local water tank was placed on the outer edge of the map. This means that the requirements for an effective arrangement for water refueling via the mobile water tank unit increased significantly. In sum, only one aspect changed from scenario to scenario, insofar as the scenarios increased in complexity and interdependence from one to four.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>An overview about all applied scales is given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Developed items specific to the experiment were knowledge about the simulation and group efficacy.</p><p>Knowledge about the simulation environment was measured with three multiple-choice questions (nine points maximum) and one cloze (looking for three words; three points maximum). Points ranged between 0 (no correct answer) and 12 (all answers correct). One example multiple-choice question is: Which fields do not ignite? Possible answers: Fields with a house; Fields closed out; Fields with a gas tank; Fields burned out; Fields with a fire-break; Fields without trees and bushes.</p><p>As three answers are right, a maximum of three points can be achieved for this question.</p><p>Group efficacy was measured with five items. One item was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker (2001)</ref>. This item was "How successful do you think your team is in firefighting in C 3 Fire?" The item was rated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = not successful at all to 5 = very successful). Four items were developed by the authors and tailored to the simulation environment, because efficacy represents task-specific expectations that a team can accomplish its goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kozlowski and Ilgen, 2006)</ref>. These four items were also rated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) and an example item is "I believe that we perform successfully as a team in protecting houses against the fire."</p><p>The team process variable, coordination, and the outcome variable, team performance, were not based on questionnaire scales; these variables resulted from data collected during the simulation task.</p><p>Team process variable Team coordination. Organizing dependencies between the teams' actions and their resources causes effective coordination. The time the firefighting units spent without water in the field in relation to the total scenario time was used as an indicator for successful coordination as it represents sharing information and resources between team members in a reciprocal manner, which are essential qualities of effective coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ellington and Dierdorff, 2014)</ref>. This measure stands for the effectiveness of resource-oriented coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lafond et al., 2011)</ref> and is an action process <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Marks et al., 2001)</ref>, as it represents an efficient performance regarding the water refill process in C 3 Fire. This process requires coordinated activities between the two firefighting units and one water tank unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lafond et al., 2011)</ref>. One team member was in charge of the mobile water tank unit and therefore responsible for filling up the water tanks of his/her own firefighting unit as well as that of the other team member on time. To do so successfully, the team members had to share information about, for example, their firefighting units' and the water tank unit's current and future positions in the field, their water levels and their strategies for extinguishing one or two fires to avoid running out of water for firefighting. The underlying assumption is that a more effective coordination process leads to fewer delays in conducting the water refill process. Coordination was calculated by a formula and values ranged between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating lower coordination in the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jobidon et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Coordination = time spent without water/total time spent in scenario. Output variable Team performance. This measure was based on a formula containing the teams' goals (limiting the number of burned-out cells and saving as many buildings as possible). Team performance was calculated as the number of protected buildings, fields, bushes/trees in relation to the number of buildings, fields and bushes/trees, respectively, which would burn in a worst-case scenario. This formula is superior to other ones published earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lafond et al., 2011)</ref> as it takes into account that teams needing more time for firefighting also have more burning cells and show a less successful performance than teams that are quick in firefighting. To define the worst-case scenarios, each of the 15-minute scenarios was run with no firefighting action taken. So, the characteristics (e.g. how many trees would burn down if no action was taken) of each scenario were assessed. The buildings, bushes/trees and fields were also weighted according to their differing significance, mirroring the teams' goals. Buildings were most important to protect. Bushes/trees (middle importance) burn faster than fields (lowest importance) and foster the spreading out of the fire. Values for team performance ranged between 0 and 7.99. Higher values indicate a better overall performance. Team performance was calculated as follows (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Team performance ¼ a=maxa ð Þ Â 5 ð Þ þ b=maxb ð Þ Â 2 ð Þ þ c=max c ð Þ Â 1 ð Þ</formula><p>Level of analysis and analytical strategy Data structure. The study design generated longitudinal nested team data and it is therefore important to clearly distinguish levels of investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kozlowski and Klein, 2000)</ref>. First, teams were matched based on their individual-level CO, which meant that the indication of high vs low CO in the team was constructed as a team-level variable. Second, the outcomes of interest (performance and coordination) were repeatedly assessed/calculated at the team level (as described above). Thus, the database for the analysis included the team's CO (Level 2) and the teams repeatedly measured and thus nested team-level coordination and performance scores (Level 1). The data structure is visualized in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Analytical strategy. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> additionally deciphers the putative longitudinal mediation process. As described in the Introduction, CO was hypothesized to influence team performance (H1a) and coordination (H1b) significantly and these relationships were hypothesized to become stronger with an increase in task complexity over time (H2). The increase in complexity was operationalized by the experimental manipulation. Further, coordination was hypothesized to mediate the influence of CO on performance (H3). To coherently analyze the multi-level longitudinal mediation model resulting from H1-H3, we chose a multivariate latent growth curve modeling approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cheong et al., 2003)</ref>. Latent growth curve modeling is used for investigating causes or determinants of change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grimm et al., 2016)</ref>. In this study, CO was investigated as a determinant for the change ("growth") and interrelation of performance and coordination over time. The advantage of growth models lies in their high flexibility regarding the modeling of complex multivariate and nested longitudinal processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Curran et al., 2010)</ref>. As this study included the analyses of a multilevel (nested team data) and conditional (analysis of CO as a predictor) dynamic longitudinal mediation process (i.e. repeatedly measured mediator and outcome), while taking control variables into account, the methodology was deemed useful in this case <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grimm et al.,2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Preacher et al., 2010)</ref>. Growth models can be fit within a structural equation or a multi-level framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blood and Cheng, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grimm et al., 2016)</ref> and both approaches have been shown to yield comparable findings (Blood and Cheng, 2011); we followed the multi-level approach in this study. We further followed the suggested parallel process approach for investigating longitudinal mediation described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cheong et al.(2003)</ref>.</p><p>First, two separate growth models for the prediction of performance (Model 1) and coordination (Model 2) through CO were fitted. Second, these models were combined for evaluating the mediation effect (Model 3). In our study, the mediator and the outcome variable are measured repeatedly over time. Mediation is supported, when the predictor (CO) significantly influences the change of the mediator (i.e. the growth rate of coordination), and when changes in the mediator subsequently affect changes in the outcome (i.e. the growth rate of performance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cheong et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">von Soest and Hagtvet, 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Means, standard deviations, internal consistencies, intra-class correlations (one-way random effects ANOVA) for team variables and correlations for all study variables are provided in Table <ref type="table">B1</ref> in the Appendix. The internal consistencies of the scales as well as ICC(1) and ICC (2) and r wg(J) proved to be satisfactory (see Table <ref type="table">B1</ref>).</p><p>Effects of collective orientation on performance H1a predicted that teams containing members with high CO values would show a significantly better team performance than teams whose members had low CO values. As Resulting data structure of team level CO and team level outcomes described above, we chose a latent growth curve modeling approach to test hypotheses coherently. Assumptions for models were met in that dependent variables were continuously measured, time spacing was the same across all teams and four measurement occasions were included. Following the parallel process procedure described above, we fitted a first growth model, including CO as a time-invariant covariate for the prediction of performance over time whilst controlling for computer affinity, knowledge and need for cognition. CO was introduced as a dummy variable, with low CO coded as the baseline category (0). The time points of performance measurement were modeled as nested over time (Level 1) within teams (Level 2). For assessing model fit, we fitted models stepwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Field, 2012)</ref>. Compared to the baseline model, model fit improved significantly by introducing random intercepts (x 2 (3) = 130.20, p &lt; 0.001). The model further improved by including time (growth factor) and CO (time-invariant covariate) as fixed effects (x 2 (7) = 10.73, p &lt; 0.01) and by including random slopes (x 2 (6) = 61.81, p &lt; 0.001), which signaled good model fit.</p><p>Random effects are evaluated by variance estimates in the latent growth model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Curran et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grimm et al., 2016)</ref>. Parameter estimates for the random effects indicated significant between-team variances for the intercept (initial performance level) (SD = 1.91; 95% CI [1.51; 2.41]) and slope (change in performance) (SD = 0.84; 95% CI [0.65; 1.08]). Intercept and slope were negatively related (cor = À0.75, 95% CI [À0.87; À0.57]), which indicated that teams starting with higher performance were expected to further improve their performance more slowly than teams who started with a rather low performance.</p><p>With regard to answering the hypothesis, we were mainly interested in the fixed effects. These showed a main effect of CO on performance (see the first part of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), signifying that right from the start of the team tasks, teams with high CO performed better than teams with low CO. This supported H1a. This further supports the treatment check; scenarios were sufficiently sensitive to detect performance differences.</p><p>Main effects of time (that is, the effect of an increase in complexity) and the time Â CO interaction were not significant (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), meaning that although teams differed Notes: b = regression coefficient beta; SE = standard error; *p &lt; 0.05; CO was coded as a dummy variable with 0 = low CO and 1 = high CO significantly in their performance right from the beginningwhich can be attributed to the experimental manipulationthey did not differ regarding their trajectory of change ("growth" rate) over time. This is contrary to the expectation formulated in H2a, by which a stronger influence (in this framework, equaling a higher "growth rate") between CO and team performance was assumed over time (i.e. with increasing complexity). For a better understanding, performance scores are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. As shown by the first growth model, teams with high CO performed constantly better than teams with low CO. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a descriptive difference in how performance develops within the teams (growth rate), in that teams with high CO maintain high performance levels over time (i.e. with an increase in complexity) and teams with low CO show worse performance toward the end. Yet, this difference in the trajectories was not significant. Finally, none of the control variables showed a significant influence on team performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of collective orientation on coordination</head><p>H1b predicted that teams containing members with high CO values would also show significantly better team coordination than teams whose members had low CO values. We accordingly fitted a second growth model, including CO as a time-invariant covariate for the prediction of coordination over time. The model was specified as described above with coordination as the outcome. Again, model fit improved compared to the baseline model by introducing random intercepts (x 2 (3)=26.83, p &lt; 0.001), time (growth factor) and CO (timeinvariant covariate) as fixed effects (x 2 (5)=13.79, p &lt; 0.01) and random slopes (x 2 (6)=29.21, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Parameter estimated for the intercept (SD = 0.08, 95% CI [0.06; 0.11]) and slope (SD = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02; 0.04]) again indicated significant between-team variances. The relation between intercept and slope was negative (r = À0.79, 95% CI [À0.92; À0.53]), comparable to the first model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Team performance growth curves for CO high and CO low teams</head><p>Looking at the fixed effects, the main effect of CO on coordination was significant (see second half of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). However, the effect was contrary to what we expected: teams with high CO were predicted to show significantly lower coordination at the beginning of the team task, as higher values indicated worse coordination behavior in this case (high values = more time without water). This is mirrored by the average coordination scores displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Although the main effect of time is again not significant (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), meaning that the groups are not expected to differ in their change trajectories (growth) in coordination over time, the interaction effect between time and CO is significant. Thus, although both groups experience a similar kind of change in coordination patterns (growth rates), with an increase in complexity over time, the effect of CO on coordination changes. With an increase in time, thus with more complexity, a more negative effect was predicted for the high CO group (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). This negative effect signifies lower coordination values (which stand for better coordination). This interaction effect is also apparent in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. While the pattern of change (growth) is similar in both groups, groups with high CO achieve better coordination in the more complex scenarios. This supports H2b in that the effect of CO on coordination becomes stronger for the more complex scenarios. Finally, none of the control variables showed a significant influence on team performance.</p><p>Taken together, team-level CO significantly influenced performance and coordination in the teams. H1a was fully supported as teams with high CO performed significantly better. H1b was partly supported, as teams with high CO showed worse coordination in the beginning but managed to coordinate better in the more complex scenarios. Finally, despite descriptive difference in the growth pattern of the two groups, team performance developed similarly over time, which did not support H2a. However, the effect of increased complexity was apparent for the coordination of the teams, which supported H2b. Final mediation model: coordination mediates effects of collective orientation on performance H3 predicted that CO shows an indirect effect on team performance via the team's coordination behavior. Mediation is supported in the parallel-process framework, if two conditions are met: 1) CO significantly influences changes (the growth rate) in coordination; 2) coordination influences changes (the growth rate) in the performance of the teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cheong et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">von Soest and Hagtvet, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Because of the complexity of the resulting model, this last step was fit with the r package lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. For this third growth model, the prediction of the growth factor of coordination by CO (mediation path a), the prediction of the growth factor of performance by the growth factor of coordination (mediation path b) and the prediction of the growth factor of performance by CO (mediation path c 0 ) were included. The resulting model statistics indicated that CO had a significant effect on the growth rate of coordination (ß = À0.09, SE = 0.04, z = À2.48, p = 0.01) and on the growth rate of performance (ß = À0.04, SE = 0.001, z = À68.75, p &lt; 0.001). Yet, the growth rate of coordination did not significantly predict performance (ß = À0.00, SE = 0.001, z = À0.01, p = 0.1). This means that changes in coordination over time did not significantly predict changes in performance over time. However, it must be noted that the resulting model indicated no good model fit (x 2 (3) = 444.73, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 1.0; RMSEA = 0.0). This might be because of the high complexity of the model and the comparable small sample size (see Limitations section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental analyses: mediation effect at each time point</head><p>Because a bad model fit does not allow for reliable conclusions, we additionally computed simple mediation models for each time point, to be able to answer H3 reliably. Furthermore, these additional analyses can give insight into the mediational processes at each time point in addition to the overall fitter mediation model. Thus, indirect effects in simple mediation models were estimated for each scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Preacher and Hayes, 2004)</ref>. CO was the independent variable, coordination the mediator and team performance the dependent variable. The findings are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, which indicated that CO has an indirect effect on team performance mediated by time without water (coordination) for Scenario 3 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) and Scenario 4 (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). In Scenario 3, CO had no direct effect on team performance (b(YX)), but CO significantly predicted coordination (b(MX)). A significant total effect (b(YX)) is not an assumption in the assessment of indirect effects, and therefore the non-significance of this relationship does not violate the analysis <ref type="bibr">(Preacher and Hayes, 2004, p. 719)</ref>. Furthermore, coordination significantly predicted team performance when controlling for CO (b(YM.X)), whereas the effect of CO on team performance was not significant when controlling for coordination (b(YX.M)). The indirect effect was 0.40 and significant when using normal distribution and estimated with the Sobel test (z = 1.97, p &lt; 0.05). The bootstrap procedure was applied to estimate the effect size not based on the assumption of normal distribution. As displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the bootstrapped estimate of the indirect effect was 0.41 and the true indirect effect was estimated to lie between 0.0084 and Indirect effects for significant mediation models 0.9215 with a 95% confidence interval. As zero is not in the 95% confidence interval, it can be concluded that the indirect effect is indeed significantly different from zero at p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed). Regarding Scenario 4, CO had a direct effect on team performance (b(YX)) and on coordination (b(MX)). Again, time without water significantly predicted team performance when controlling for CO (b(YM.X)), whereas the effect of CO on team performance was not significant when controlling for coordination (b(YX.M)). This time, the indirect effect was 0.60 (Sobel test, z = 2.31, p &lt; 0.05). As displayed in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, the bootstrapped estimate of the indirect effect was 0.61 and the true indirect effect was estimated to lie between 0.1876 and 1.1014 with a 95% confidence interval and between 0.0340 and 1.2578 with a 99% confidence interval. Because zero is not in the 99% confidence interval, it can be concluded that the indirect effect is indeed significantly different from zero at p &lt; 0.01 (two-tailed). Summing up, the multivariate latent growth model did not indicate a Notes: Y = Team Performance Scenario 4; X = Collective orientation T0; M = coordination (time without water in Scenario 4); number of bootstrap resamples = 5,000; *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01 mediational process. However, this result was not reliable as model fit was evaluated poorly. Supplementary simple mediation models partially supported H3 by the results of Scenarios 3 and 4, indicating that CO has an indirect effect on team performance mediated by the teams' coordination.</p><p>The effect of group potency and efficacy on CO and performance H4a predicted that the positive relation between group potency and team performance disappears, when including group efficacy into the model, whereas the relationship between CO and team performance persists (H4b). The correlations of group potency (r = 0.25, p &lt; 0.01), group efficacy (r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.01) and CO (r = 0.29, p &lt; 0.01) with team performance were all positive and significant (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">B2</ref> in the Appendix). A hierarchical regression was calculated with group potency in the first block, with group potency and group efficacy in the second block and with group potency, group efficacy and CO as predictors in the third block and team performance overall (mean of team performance above all four scenarios) as criterion. The assumption of independent errors was met, with the Q-Q-plots demonstrating randomly distributed values and the Durbin-Watson statistic amounting to 1.16. Moreover, no multicollinearity occurred within the data, as all variance inflation factor values were well below 10 (1.00-1.81) and the tolerance statistics were all well above 0.2 (0.55-0.92). The coefficients are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. In the first model, group potency (b = 0.25, p &lt; 0.01) was a significant predictor and accounted for 6% of the variance. In the second model, only group efficacy (b = 0.55, p &lt; 0.01) was a significant predictor and accounted for 23% of the variance. The change in R 2 from Step 1 to Step 2 was significant (p &lt; 0.01). In the third model, group efficacy (b = 0.50, p &lt; 0.01) and CO (b = 0.17, p = 0.05) were significant predictors and accounted for 26% of the variance. The change in R 2 from Step 2 to Step 3 was significant (p = 0.05). The standardized beta value for group efficacy was bigger than that for CO, so that group efficacy had the most impact on team performance and group potency had the least impact. Hence, H4a and H4b were supported, indicating that the positive relation between group efficacy and team performance is stronger than the relation between group potency and team performance, so that it is no longer significant, whereas the relation between CO and team performance persists. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of our research was first to strengthen the findings concerning the positive impact of team members' CO on team performance and coordination in interdependent team contexts. Second, we sought to examine the effect of CO on team performance and team coordination as a function of an increase in the complexity of the task while controlling for other variables. Third, we were interested in the underlying processes supporting teamwork and analyzed the indirect effect of CO on team performance mediated by the teams' coordination behavior. Fourth, we sought to strengthen the unique finding that the effect of group potency on team performance vanishes when controlling for group efficacy, whereas, simultaneously, in this study, the effect of CO on team performance still exists, so that CO shows incremental validity. Finally, we wished to present the micro-world C 3 Fire and demonstrate its potential and the validity of the developed scenarios representing interdependent team tasks to highlight its use for the analysis of team performance and processes.</p><p>Collective orientation, team performance, coordination and the influence of increasing complexity We were able to strengthen the findings that teams containing members with high CO values show a significantly higher team performance in an intensive interdependent team task than teams whose members have low CO values <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Driskell and Salas, 1992)</ref>. Even though the growth curves did not show that team performance increases with increasing complexity of the scenarios in the group of CO high values, it could be shown that the performance of the teams with CO high values remained constant, whereas the performance of the teams with CO low values decreased significantly toward the end after an initial increase in team performance. Thus, a positive expression of the CO of team members seems to counteract a decrease in performance in complex working environments and helps to cope with the increased demands on teamwork. Further, the results showed thatalthough teams with low CO first showed better coordination pattern at the start of the team taskteams with higher CO were able to coordinate significantly better than teams with low CO with increasing complexity (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). This supports the hypothesized positive effect of CO on team coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eby and Dobbins, 1997)</ref>. Moreover, this finding was strengthened by the additional mediation analysis: the indirect effect of CO on performance via coordination becomes apparent for the more complex scenarios (3 and 4).</p><p>As coordination refers to the orchestration of the sequence and timing of interdependent actions, it requires mutual adjustments as well as frequent information integration within the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stajkovic et al., 2009)</ref>. Team members with high CO values are more able to fulfill these requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010)</ref>, as they are more able to recognize that their individual actions are relevant in obtaining desired outcomes in the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Karau and Williams, 1993)</ref>. It was also shown that the higher the degree of task complexity, the stronger these requirements for coordination are. It might seem obvious that an attitude does not directly influence team performance but rather affects the teamwork process, which in turn contributes to successful team performance. Thus, we also analyzed this indirect effect in H3. The time, which firefighters spent without water in a scenario, was the indicator for high-quality coordination, because it represents sharing information and resources between team members in a reciprocal manner, which are essential qualities of effective coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ellington and Dierdorff, 2014)</ref>. In the present study, the team member who was in charge of the mobile water tank unit was responsible for filling up the water tanks of his/her own firefighting unit as well as that of the other team member on time. That means the team members had to share information about, for example, their firefighting units' current and future positions in the field, their water levels, their strategies for extinguishing one or two fires and the water tank unit's current and future position in the field to avoid running out of water for firefighting. The multivariate latent growth model did not indicate an indirect effect, which might, on the one hand, be because of poor model fit (see Limitations). It is also conceivable that the overall latent growth mediation model did not yield a significant result, as the effect of CO on performance was only mediated by coordination in the more complex scenarios. The estimation of indirect effects in simple mediation models indicated that CO has an indirect effect on team performance mediated by time without water in Scenarios 3 and 4. Thus, CO facilitates high-quality coordination and this in turn influences team performance positively. These results support and, more importantly, now connect single previous findings concerning the relationships between individual attitudes, such as CO, and the team process, such as coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cannon-Bowers et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Driskell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sonnentag and Volmer, 2009)</ref> and between the team process and the team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dierdorff et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Stevens and Campion, 1994</ref>) in one study.</p><p>The fact that significant indirect effects were found only in Scenarios 3 and 4 could be because of the varying complexity of the scenarios. Within these two scenarios, the available amount of water for firefighting is more important for the teams' success than in the first and second scenarios, because a second fire ignites during these scenarios. Likewise, the refilling of the firefighters' water tanks and therefore the coordination also becomes more crucial for success. Moreover, another characteristic changed in Scenario 4 (see Table <ref type="table">B1</ref> in the Appendix): the local water tank is positioned at the outside margin of the field, such that the distance between it and the firefighting units and the mobile water tank unit increases. Thus, the team members were able to save critical time for firefighting when they did not try to reach the local water tank but coordinated their actions to use the mobile water tank unit to refill their own water tanks. Considered in relation to the team performance results, this paints an interesting picture: teams with high CO performed better right from the start of the team task although they showed worse coordination in the start. With increased complexity, teams with high CO were able to adapt their coordination better than teams with low CO, which enabled them to keep up their good performance. In that regard, teams with high CO had the potential to unlock improved coordinationa potential that low CO teams did not seem to possess. At a high level of complexity, the resulting requirements on team members may begin to exceed their capacities to respond, creating a condition of overload and leading to lowered coordination behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Wood, 1986)</ref>. As this overload will be a function of individual skills and attitudes, CO seems to counteract this overload. These results indicate that the relationship between CO and team performance is apparent for highly interdependent team tasks in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gully et al., 2002)</ref>, whereas the relationship between CO and coordination does not only depend on the level of interdependence but also on the degree of complexity in an interdependent team task.</p><p>Relationships between collective orientation, emergent states and team performance Emergent states, which represent properties of the team such as attitudes or motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(DeChurch and Mesmer-Magnus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marks et al., 2001)</ref>, and which support the execution of behavioral processes relevant for successful team performance, were of interest in H4. The positive relations between group efficacy and group potency with team performance are empirically proved already <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Campion et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gully et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Katz-Navon and Erez, 2005)</ref>. Thus, it was of interest for us, if the effect of CO on team performance is strong enough when controlling for these two emergent states. Both group efficacy and group potency showed a significant relation with team performance. The effect of group efficacy on team performance was stronger than the effect of group potency on team performance. When including the two emergent states simultaneously into the regression model, the effect of group potency on team performance vanished, similar to the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stajkovic et al. (2009)</ref>. In contrast, this phenomenon could not be replicated for CO. The positive relation between CO and team performance persisted when analyzing this relationship along with group efficacy. The high correlation between group efficacy and group potency (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">B2</ref> in the Appendix) was not only found in the present study: the meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gully et al. (2002)</ref> likewise reported an average correlation of about 0.67. This indicates a strong overlap, even though <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gully et al.(2002)</ref> showed that the relation between group efficacy and team performance is moderated by interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gibson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Katz-Navon and Erez, 2005)</ref>, whereas that of group potency is not. As group efficacy and group potency correlated highly and the relationship between group potency and team performance disappeared when controlling for group efficacy (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stajkovic et al., 2009)</ref>, group efficacy might be the more valid measure in team performance research. CO showed its unique contribution to the team performance and therefore demonstrated its relevance for team composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of the hypothesized control variables</head><p>Concerning NFC, the finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kearney et al.(2009)</ref> could not be replicated in the present study, as the team members' NFC was not significantly associated with the changes in team performance and coordination. A difference between the two studies lay in the assessment of team performance: <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kearney et al. (2009)</ref> asked the team leaders to rate the performance of their teams, whereas the present study assessed team performance with an objective measure. Thus, the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kearney et al. (2009)</ref> might be biased, as the team performance ratings given by the team leaders might be influenced by their subjective perception of the team members' tendencies to engage in and enjoy thinking. Furthermore, the mean value of NFC was relatively high in the present sample and the standard deviation was small, such that little variation existed. One reason for this may be that our sample consisted of students, with a similar age and educational background, meaning that the results are not representative for the general population. Empirical results support the non-significant relationship between NFC and team performance found in the present study, under the circumstance that teams are homogeneous in terms of age and educational level <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Henningsen and Henningsen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kearney et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>As the team task was a computer-based simulation, the results might have been affected by the participants' attitudes to using a computer. Results showed that the team members' positive attitudes to using a computer did not influence the change in coordination or in the performance about the course of the four scenarios. Computer affinity or computer aversion seems to not influence the work with the C 3 Fire environment.</p><p>For a successful operation of the simulation environment, knowledge about the units, entities, functions and roles is essential. For example, the participants have to learn how to move a unit from one position to another, how to refill the water tanks or how to extinguish a burning field. Therefore, initial training to handle the simulation was required, and was conducted with each team before assessing the performance in each scenario. As participants who have learned more during training might show a better team performance than those who have learned less, we expected the task-specific knowledge to show a significant influence on team performance. In our study, knowledge did not significantly influence changes in team performance or coordination. This finding might be because of the chosen methodology. The latent growth modeling approach means that we did not look at the influence of the control variables on the total team performance or coordination at each measurement occasion (like one would with variance analysis, for example). Rather, the chosen analytical framework looks at how the variables might influence the development (growth curves) of the outcomes. Hence, it is conceivable that knowledge has a significant influence at single measurement occasions (e.g. at the start of the task), but this influence might not predict changes over time and is thus not detectable within our analytical framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The applied laboratory research for analyzing teamwork processes and results might have further limitations. Teamwork, as demonstrated in this study, fails to account for the fact that teams are not simple, static and isolated entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(McGrath et al., 2000)</ref>. The validity of the results could be reduced insofar as the complex relationships in teams were not represented; the teamwork context was not considered; not all teammates and teams were comparable; and the characteristic of a team as a dynamic system with a team history and future was not given in the present study. Concerning the relationships between personrelated and team variables and team performance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell (2007)</ref> demonstrated in her metaanalysis that the relationship between team members' attitudes and values and the team's performance proved to be stronger in the field compared to the laboratory. Thus, the significant as well as non-significant results within this study should be viewed in light of this finding. Nevertheless, although the results are based on a laboratory study, previous research has shown that the results of laboratory experiments can be usefully implemented in organizational settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Locke, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we want to address the methodological limitation that the investigation of the mediation model could not be based on the multivariate latent growth model because of poor model fit. Although no rules for adequate sample sizes for growth models are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grimm et al., 2016)</ref> and growth models have been fitted successfully to samples N &lt; 25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Curran, 2010)</ref>, the estimated mediation model is complex and the sample size, in comparison, is relatively small. This might have led to poor model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cheong, 2011)</ref>. However, answering H3 was possible by the supplementary simple mediation models, so that it was only for the coherence of the analysis to be impaired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for future research and practice</head><p>A benefit of KSAs is that they can be changed by training, in contrast to traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, a great deal of research has focused on team training as a significant contributor to team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Salas et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Salas et al., 2008)</ref>. As CO is an attitude and can be positively influenced by training, for example, its significant role concerning the relation between team composition and team effectiveness and performance should be considered more carefully in group and team (training) research. In future research, it would be interesting to identify the factors that are able to influence the team members' CO and therefore to identify and develop methods which positively change the CO at work. A factor in the work organization possibly influencing CO might be an incentive system. Some organizations working with team-based structures prefer individual incentive systems, whereas others have implemented group or team incentive systems. Research has already shown that group incentive enhances team and therefore organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Che and Yoo, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Libby and Thorne, 2009)</ref>. It also encourages team members to communicate more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kelly, 2010)</ref>. Against this background, it would be interesting to find out whether group incentives also increase the members' CO over time and thus the coordination behavior in the team. Another work organization factor might be the group or team size. As most of the literature recommends seven people to be the best number for successful teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Powell and Lorenz, 2019)</ref>, research has shown that team performance decreases with an increase in team size <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Forsyth, 2010)</ref>. It is assumed that an increase in team size leads to a perception of less support from other team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Müller, 2012)</ref> and to less identification with the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cunningham and Chelladurai, 2004</ref>). Thus, it would be interesting to analyze whether CO of team members decreases with an increase in team size and if this change starts with the magical number of seven.</p><p>Team leaders might also be able to influence the CO of their team members positively through their behavior. In this regard, the analysis of leadership styles would be interesting, especially the team-oriented leadership in which the leader emphasizes effective teambuilding and implements and continuously points out a common purpose or goal among the team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Javidan et al., 2006)</ref>. A method to positively influence the CO might be the application of feedback by leaders or supervisors, for example. Feedback opens opportunities for reflection and learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Edmondson, 1999)</ref> and attitudes can be influenced by experience or learning, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kozlowski and Ilgen, 2006)</ref>. Thus, it would be of interest to analyze what feedback type is able to influence CO positively, because depending on the kind of feedback, various main points are addressed during the feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gabelica et al., 2012)</ref>. Feedback can focus on performance or on the process and it can be given on an individual-or a team-level. As researchers discuss the possibility that team-level process feedback shifts attention processes on team actions and team learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hinsz et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">McLeod et al., 1992)</ref>, it would be interesting to analyze whether it is possible to positively change the CO of a team member and therefore influence action processes such as coordination and also team performance. Especially within the domain of team-based jobs in interdependent work contexts, such as in aviation, the fire service, police or emergency rescue service, CO seems to play a crucial role for successful team coordination and performance. As these domains are affected by demographic change, for example, it is not possible to hire employees only if they meet all preferable criteria, such as predefined attitudes. Therefore, it would be important to shift the focus from personnel selection to personnel development, the organization of work and leader behavior, and identify solutions for organizations regarding how they can be enabled to positively influence the CO of their team members on the job.</p><p>Because of the methodological approach, the computer-based simulation, the teams' coordination performance was assessed objectively based on logged data and was not a subjective measure, as is often the case in group and team research studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Antoni and Hertel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dierdorff et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ellington and Dierdorff, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Van de Ven et al., 1976)</ref>. As coordination was a mediator in the analysis, this objective measurement supports the validity of the study results. Furthermore, the validity of the applied simulation scenarios was demonstrated as they represent interdependent teamwork, are able to demonstrate performance differences and enable the analysis of changing teamwork processes. For example, putting the local water tank at the outside margin of the field or fighting a second fire definitely changed the teams' coordination behavior. By applying four scenarios in this study, we were able to show the stability of the effects. In addition, because of the four independent scenarios, it was not the case that a bad decision or a wrong action put the individual in an unwinnable situation with no way back, in contrast to other micro-worlds analyzing individual or team behavior in complex environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brehmer and Dörner, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dörner et al., 1983)</ref>. Thus, we can thoroughly recommend the micro-world C 3 Fire for team research, for the analysis of interdependent teamwork and for research objectives within human resource management topics.</p><p>When doing so in future research, other variables than in the present study might be controlled. As C 3 Fire looks like a simple version of a computer game, the computer gaming behavior of the team members could be assessed and included into the analyses, as it might influence the skills in handling the scenarios. Another person-related variable influencing the handling of the computer-based scenarios could be the technology commitment with its three dimensionstechnology acceptance, technology competence and technology control <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Neyer et al., 2012)</ref>. As it says that people differ in their willingness to use a technology, people with higher values in technology commitment might be more successful in handling the simulation.</p><p>As team process research mostly concentrates on the analysis of transition and action processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Marks et al., 2001)</ref>, the computer-based simulation team task could not only be used for collecting objective data for action processes such as coordination. It could also be applied to collect objective data for transition processes such as mission analysis, formulation and planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Prince and Salas, 1993)</ref>, e.g. fighting one or more fires, goal specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Prussia and Kinicki, 1996)</ref>, e.g. protecting houses or tents or hospitals or vegetation, and strategy formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Prince and Salas, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cannon-Bowers et al., 1995)</ref>, e.g. positioning of water tank or spreading fire-fighting units across the map. Therefore, the recorded communication of all players in the log files could be analyzed, for example. Thus, when using this computer-based simulation in future studies, it would be possible to easily collect objective data concerning these processes to show their importance on performance within teamwork research. Another idea would be the possibility to combine this simulation with eye-tracking methods in a lab to collect data about action processes such as monitoring progress toward goals, e.g. collecting information how many cells are extinguished, or system monitoring, e.g. keeping track of the wind direction.</p><p>Furthermore, the simulation has many degrees of freedom, so that the scenarios can be adapted to the specific research purpose. That means for example, the length of the scenarios can vary, from very short ones (duration of 5 min) to very long ones (duration of 1 or 3 h) or the numbers of team members can be changed and also one or more leaders in different hierarchical positions can be integrated into the scenarios. That also implies that it would be possible to develop scenarios with more than one team working in it. Thus, the computer-based simulation makes it possible to do standardized teamwork research with good internal and external validity and analyze, for example, the effects of different leadership styles on team behavior and performance, effects of communication styles on the quality of leader member relationships or effects of group incentives for different team performances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, the results of our research provide evidence of how CO influences interdependently working team members and their performance. A central implication of our work is that a thorough understanding of team functioning requires the inclusion of CO within the analyses of team processes and team performance. Accordingly, practitioners, especially within high-risk organizations, would be well advised either to consider CO as a team composition variable in selection processes or to find strategies to positively influence CO during work processes.

Hence, one group of teams (n = 29) was characterized by high CO values (M = 3.44; SD = 0.32) and one group (n = 29) by low CO values (M = 2.79; SD = 0.35). The participants were invited to the experimental study by e-mail three weeks after filling in the CO instrument and the investigator made single appointments with all 58 teams. Each trial run included one team, took about 2 h, and started with an introduction to the experimental procedure and the teams' task. The teammates were familiarized with the simulation, received 20 min of training and completed two practice trials during training. After the training, participants answered a first set of questionnaires. All control variables were assessed at this point.Especially the measurement of task-specific knowledge was important after training and before starting the experimental scenarios assessing coordination and performance. Following this, the first simulation scenario started and the teams had a maximum of 15 min to perform successfully (for more information, see the interdependent team task). Subsequently, participants worked on Scenarios 2, 3 and 4 (each lasting for a maximum of 15 min, with increasing complexity/difficulty) and answered questionnaires in the middle of the experiment regarding group efficacy and potency. Communication between the teammates happened by means of a chat system. The experiment finished with a debriefing. The overall procedure and measurement points are displayed in Figure1. The study was approved in advance by the university's ethics committee.</figDesc></figure>
