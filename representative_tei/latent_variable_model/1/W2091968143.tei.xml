<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The paper contributes to the operationalisation of the capabilities approach to welfare economics by developing and analyzing data on the freedoms of adults in Argentina. Specifically, it reports on the development and delivery of a survey instrument for measuring capabilities, calculates for each respondent a Nehring-Puppe type index of capabilities and examines the distribution of index scores. The main analytic part of the paper then goes on to develop a generalized linear latent and mixed model (GLLAMM) for assessing the impact of capabilities on life satisfaction, in which allowance is made for (i) unobserved heterogeneity and (ii) possible endogeneity, by introducing latent individual effects and by instrumenting capability variables using income and other socio-economic variables. Our empirical results show that empathy, self-worth, goalautonomy, discrimination, safety and stress are statistically significant determinants of life satisfaction, in a decreasing order of importance. The paper concludes by suggesting that, if replicated, the findings have profound implications for the conceptualisation and evaluation of economic progress.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Capability Approach is grounded in an attempt to address fundamental theoretical limits that are inevitable in utilitarian approaches to welfare economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sen (1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sen ( , 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sen ( , 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sen ( , 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sen ( , 1999))</ref>), but it can also be seen as a generalisation of the traditional approach to welfare economics. Whilst happiness is important, Sen argues, so are the opportunities to do things that people have reason to value and these capabilities should be integral to the assessment of a person's welfare. The approach is consistent with the emergence of labour policies that emphasised equality of opportunity in the 1970s, evidently, but is widely credited with inspiring the development of the UN's Human Development Index (HDI) which now plays a key role in the assessment of economic development. 2  It has been questioned to what extent the capabilities approach can be broadened beyond HDI given a purported lack of data on opportunities and constraints (particularly non-monetary) though more recent work has suggested some constructive ways forward. Broadly, there are three strands to this emerging literature. Firstly some researchers e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anand et al. (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ramos and Silber (2005)</ref> have made the point that with careful inspection, a number of direct capability indicators can be found in standard secondary data sets, like the BHPSfurthermore such variables appear to be on the increase. A second line of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Krishnakumar (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Krishnakumar ( , 2008))</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Krishnakumar and Ballon (2008)</ref>) has developed a variety of latent variable structural models that demonstrate how econometric techniques can be used to make inferences about capabilities and their impacts even when direct capability measures are not present in the data. Thirdly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anand et al. (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anand and Santos (2007)</ref> have shown how capability indicators, consistent with theory, can be developed both for a general adult population and for older people across a range of dimensions that impact the quality of their lives.</p><p>In this paper, we present work that draws on the latter two traditions. Specifically we develop a data-set of capabilities for Argentina which in effect broadens the potential coverage of capability indexes to many more dimensions than can be found in HDI. 3 In subsequent analysis, we then draw on latent variable structural models to explore whether these capabilities have an impact on happiness, whilst addressing potential problems of endogeneity that might exist in this context. In fact, we shall address three empirical questions: (a) do capabilities have a direct impact on overall life satisfaction 4 , (b) do individual features play a significant role in this self-assessment exercise and finally (c) is there unobservable heterogeneity present in the relationship. Because, capabilities and happiness are both based on self-reports (like most economic data from household surveys), it is possible that personality plays a role in both the evaluations, giving rise to an endogeneity issue. For this reason we shall try to separate out effects of personality on happiness to obtain a 'purer' measure of the influence of capabilities.</p><p>The models and estimation methods we propose combine three methodological aspects in order to answer a substantive question about life satisfaction: First, the response variable is of an ordinal nature. Hence, we shall model it in a qualitative response framework (with an underlying continuous latent variable).</p><p>Secondly, the responses are elucidated using a set of explanatory factors relating to the individual's choices and achievements in life along with her personality traits. In addition, there may be unobserved effects accounting for similarity of behaviour and perceptions and we would like to account for these specific effects.</p><p>A final issue is that of endogeneity. It is true that the choice set should influence 'happiness' but one can also argue that a person who reports being satisfied may generally be of an 'optimistic' nature and hence be able to imagine more opportunities in any given situation compared with a 'pessimist'. This will imply that a happier person is also more likely to report a larger feasible set so the relationship between happiness and capabilities may be simultaneous. In this case, capabilities are potentially endogenous in the life satisfaction model and in this paper we estimate a model that allows for this.</p><p>We shall therefore specify a system of equations for jointly explaining life satisfaction and capabilities but we shall also allow for latent personality features affecting both, to take account of any unobservable heterogeneity. Further, we let the different 'observed' personality measures to partially reflect the latent personality. The complete model consisting of the life satisfaction equation, capability equations and personality measurement equations fits well within the GLLAMM (Generalised linear latent and mixed models) framework. An excellent reference on latent variable models is given by Rabe- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hesketh and Skrondal (2004)</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a description of Sen's three equations and indicates how the capabilities happiness relation is derived from two of these relations. Section 3 (together with Appendix A) provides a discussion of the data used with some descriptive statistics. Section 4 then goes on to discuss the modelling approach in greater detail comparing it with other more conventional approaches whilst Section 5 carries an analysis of the main estimation results. Section 6 provides some summary and concluding remarks. <ref type="bibr">(1985)</ref>'s formal account of the capabilities approach to welfare economics comprises a set of three related equations. The first, f i = f i (r i ), notes that functionings, fi, depend on the resources, ri, available to a person, i. People start off with different resource endowments, and they are heterogenous with respect to their abilities to convert those resources into functionings, so this equation encapsulates issues that are central to the analysis of equity. The second equation, h i = hi(f i ), summarises the view that a person's happiness, or utility, depends on the functionings in which an individual partakes. We might see this relation as a plausible first-order approximation, particularly given Sen's wide account of functionings as doings and beings but in any case it provides a direct point of contact between his approach and earlier approaches to welfare economics. Thirdly, and finally, Sen argues that in addition to a person's chosen functioning bundle, the set of all functioning bundles a person could have chosen given their initial resource endowment,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical setting</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sen</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q i ≡ { f i1 , f i2 , … f in },</formula><p>is also a measure of their advantage. The set Q, referred to as the person's capability set, corresponds to an idea that has a long-standing history in economics (viz. the value of freedom) although Sen's approach provides a distinctive grammar for thinking about connections between freedom and concepts of equity, resource endowment and happiness.</p><p>One of the important concerns in this paper is the development of data that will help provide a summary measurement of Q, by asking people a variety of questions about their opportunities, abilities and constraints in a wide variety of life domains (dimensions). These questions are somewhat novel and provide a natural fit for the concept of freedom. The data will be described in more detail subsequently, but theoretically, this amounts to characterising the set Q by eliciting boundary points for the dimensions in which the functionings operate. The approach can be contrasted with the direct enumeration of elements of Q which would instead yield an mdimensional cuboid estimate of the capability set and would not, in most cases, be practical (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Klemish-Ahlert (1993)</ref>). In general, it is not possible to sign the nature of the approximation as there may be reasons to think that some capabilities are jointly constrained (e.g. choice of career path) whilst others are complements (the opportunity to go to a concert and the ability to hear). So, to create a summary index of a person's capabilities based on observations of self reported freedoms, given by the point Q ˆ= q 1 ; q 2 ; :::q m ð Þ where q 1 , represents a person's capability score in life domain 1 and so on, we draw on an idea due to <ref type="bibr">Nehring and</ref><ref type="bibr">Puppe (2002, 2009)</ref>. Essentially, their axiomatic proposal is to create a measure which moves beyond option counting: by considering the number of dimensions that are realised by the options of a set, they provide a compelling example in the case of measuring species diversity. Carrying this idea into the field of welfare and deprivation assessment, it is natural to ask in how many dimensions a person has freedoms that are above a threshold level and to make this assessment, we therefore construct an index of capabilities which is defined as the count, ˜Q, of dimensions, on which the capability score, q is greater than or equal to some threshold level q Ã . In short, we develop the summary capability index,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q i = ∑ m j = 1 I ij where I ij = 1 if q ij ≥ q Ã ij = 0 otherwise<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>This index provides an intuitive measure of capability, is useful for deprivation assessment, and incorporates a notion of dimensional richness. In addition one could see this as a multi-dimensional 3 The authors are particularly grateful to Graciela Tonon whose team was responsible for the translation of the OCAP survey instrument into Spanish as well as the collection of data.</p><p>4 Throughout the paper we use life satisfaction as a synonym for happiness.</p><p>measure of deprivation. Furthermore, our index suggests a family of capability measures depending on the specification of thresholds and assumptions about independence between dimensions though in the following section we explore a single implementation.</p><p>The main econometric model of this paper draws on Sen's theory by noting that a) happiness depends on functionings, and b) capabilities are defined as the set of functions feasible for a person. Therefore this framework naturally implies a relationship between happiness and capabilities. We exploit this connection to identify robust contributors to quality of lifea key concern for policy-makers seeking to base social choice on welfare. Within the capabilities approach, the freedoms that matter are those that people have reason to value and these can be identified by a mixture of theory, argument and evidence. Within utilitarianism, freedoms only matter insofar as they yield happiness. So potentially, those freedoms that are significant in econometric models of happiness represent common ground between the two main approaches to welfare economics and can be robust in that sense. Whether such a ground exists is one of the questions that our model helps us to address.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data description</head><p>The data used in our analysis derive from a national sample of 976 adults, in five urban areas of Argentina, who received, in 2007, version of the OCAP survey instrument specifically developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anand et al. (2009)</ref> to measure capabilities across a wide range of life domains. This version was developed by translating the original OCAP instrument into Spanish and then dropping, or modifying slightly, a small number of questions to reflect the cultural context. This process was led by an Argentinian colleague working closely with the first author and is further discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tonon (2008)</ref> though all the capability questions used here are summarised in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>The key variable to be explained is self reported life satisfaction which comes as a response to the question "How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your life as a whole?". 5 The respondents were asked to indicate their degree of life satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 denotes Completely satisfied and 7 Completely dissatisfied.</p><p>Hence it is a categorical variable with 7 possible categories. However, some categories only contain a very small percentage of responses and hence we have combined them to obtain 4 groups and inverted the direction so that 1 denotes Dissatisfied, 2 Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 3 Fairly satisfied and the last level 4 Very satisfied. 6</p><p>The set of capability indicators is also composed of self-reported degrees of agreement to different statements related to several aspects. We have constructed ten capability domains as follows: Health, Freedom of Political Expression, Freedom of Political Participation, Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Thought, Emotional Capabilities, Security, Environment and Social Relations, Discrimination Outside of Work and finally Work. One may observe that we have given slightly different names to some of our domains compared to those in the list found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nussbaum (2000)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nussbaum and Sen (1993)</ref> on which the questionnaire is based. However this is not an issue for the purpose of our paper. Since we are mainly interested in the influence of capabilities on life satisfaction, it does not matter what name is given to each capability domain nor which capability goes into which domain as long as they are all capability indicators entering our model as explanatory (possibly endogenous) variables. Nonetheless, our terminology directly reflects the statements of the questionnaire. So, for example, Bodily Health from Nussbaum's list corresponds to our field Health. In the same way, our item Security is also part of Nussbaum's Bodily Health, and our item Emotional Capabilities matches with Nussbaum's Emotions. However, our taxonomy contrasts from Nussbaum's list in that we distinguish different forms of freedom which would all be seen as going into Nussbaum's Senses, Imagination and Thought group.</p><p>The complete list of capabilities along with other variables can be found in Appendix A. The questions are self explanatory and discussed elsewhere (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anand et al. (2009)</ref>). In addition, the data set includes questions related to past experiences which can be considered as predetermined variables having a definite influence on current capabilities. Not all variables available in the questionnaire have been used in the analysis. Several variables related to work and income have been left aside due to the large number of missing values and some highly correlated variables are dropped to meet the number of instruments required.</p><p>Finally, we have some variables on "personality traits". <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gosling and Rentfrow (2003)</ref> distinguish five major independent personality dimensions: being extravert, agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, open to experiences. Our data set contains pairs of individual measures in all these dimensions on a scale one to seven. Thus each pair of indicators measures one particular aspect and its opposite (See Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, Appendix A). These answers are considered as personality trait indicators and can be relevant to disentangle the endogeneity issue, essentially arising out of individual characteristics. For instance, if an individual is assessing herself as "anxious, easily upset", then she may feel constrained in her beings and doings and at the same time not too satisfied with her life. Hence this state of mind and other such personality traits are key factors that simultaneously affect capability answers as well as reported life satisfaction and will thus enable us to deal with the potential endogeneity problem in an adequate manner.</p><p>Taking into account all the missing observations, the dataset used in our study comprises 42 variables related to capabilities, 24 sociodemographic variables, 5 personality traits (10 personality variables corresponding to these 5 big personality traits) and 12 variables associated with past experience.</p><p>Before we formulate the structural model, we briefly examine some descriptive statistics relating to our key variables. Looking at a two-way classification between life satisfaction and some capability variables, we see that the majority of people who are fairly satisfied or very satisfied are in good health, have freedom of expression, political participation, religion and thought. However when it comes to emotional areas there is a substantial percentage that feel it difficult to enjoy the love, care and support of their family or to enjoy day-today activities. Regarding security/safety there is a slightly higher percentage of people that feel insecure than those feeling secure (leaving out neutral responses) with a 14 to 29% of the 'insecure' in the fairly satisfied or very satisfied category. Similarly a good percentage feel that they are likely to be discriminated against for some reason or another though their life satisfaction response is good.</p><p>Turning now to the personality characteristics, there are some clear patterns that emerge from the data: 74% see themselves as critical, 92% as self-disciplined, 75% as anxious, 85% as open to new experiences, 77% as reserved, 86% as sympathetic, and 69% calm. Only for a few traits, the percentages are lower: 45% claim not to be disorganized, 50% claim not to be conventional.</p><p>To conclude our description of the data, we derive two summary figures that describe the extent to which the individuals in our sample enjoy important capabilities, confining ourselves to individuals with no missing data and to the 42 capabilities given in Appendix A. First we define category 1 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, Appendix A) as the threshold category such that if the answer to a capability question is 1 or higher, then the individual is deemed to possess the capability in question. Then we calculate the percentage of individuals that enjoy each capability and finally we graph these percentages as a bar chart (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), with each bar corresponding to a capability with the number coded according to Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, we see that there are significant 'deprivations' (more than 50% not enjoying the capability) in certain dimensions: being able to value nature (C8), being discriminated at work except due to age (C20-C23), being discriminated outside of work except due to age (C25-C28), being able to value others (C31), inadequate housing (C35). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">7</ref>The next summary representation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) relates to the distribution of number of capabilities enjoyed in the population surveyed i.e. 5 Another question related to life satisfaction was asked at the end of the questionnaire. We decided to use only the first question related to the overall life satisfaction as the response variable. Both response variables could be used to test the impact of filling the questionnaire on the self-evaluation of life satisfaction, but that issue goes beyond our present study. 6 The response categories were originally set up to seven levels with 1: Completely  capability number (see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) the number of capabilities enjoyed plotted against the percentage (or number) in the sample 8 enjoying that many capabilities. We see that the majority of people are in the middle in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>  Splitting the sample between women and men, the distributions of the number of capabilities enjoyed by women and men are presented in Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref> respectively. Although no firm statement can be made simply by looking at these graphs, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution equality test accepts that men and women have the same distribution with a p-value of 0.68. 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The model</head><p>As the main aim of the study is to estimate the relationship between capabilities and life satisfaction, more specifically the impact of capabilities on life satisfaction, our key endogenous variable is life satisfaction and the main explanatory variables are the capabilities in various domains. In our data set the answer to the life satisfaction question is an ordinal categorical variableoriginally 7 categories regrouped into 4 categories for our analysis. 10  The explanatory variables of the above relationship are given by indicators relating to people's capabilities in various domains which are either binary or ordered categorical. As the response to life satisfaction question is a subjective evaluation, it is likely to be influenced by an individual's personality. Given the same choice or capability set, two persons can be more or less satisfied with life depending on their personality characteristics. A person who always thinks "positively" (say an 'optimistic' person) is likely to take more advantage of the possibilities offered to her than someone who has a more "negative" attitude to life (a 'pessimistic' one). Thus it is important to capture the heterogeneity in individual characteristics in the relationship between capabilities and life satisfaction by including individual personality traits as explanatory variables. Two approaches could be followed in this regard. The first is to assume that the available indicators relating to personality questions are exact measurements of personality and include them directly in our relationship. In this case, the remaining unexplained part (error term) can be assumed to be independent of capabilities. A second approach consists in assuming that the observed indicators are different responses of a latent personality which is included in the unexplained error term of the equation. In this case, capabilities become endogenous as they will also be affected by the same latent factor, being self reported subjective evaluations. Thus we would need to complete the life satisfaction equation with other equations that explain the capabilities themselves using some exogenous factors as well as unobservable individual characteristics which will form part of the unexplained error term, and add a latent factor model for personality using the available personality indicators as its measurements. In our study, we follow both the approaches and compare the results.</p><p>Let us now turn to the model specification in more detail. For simplicity of presentation, we present below the modelling approach for continuous dependent variables. Appendix B describes the extension for categorical dependent variables.</p><p>Let y i denote the response to the life satisfaction of the i-th individual; Q i denote the vector of capability indicators of the i-th individual (say M × 1); x i denote the vector of socio-economic characteristics of the i-th individual (say K × 1); and P i denote the vector of personality traits of the i-th individual (say T × 1).</p><p>Then the relationship to be explored can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y i = h Q i ð Þ + ε i<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>8 The sample here only consists of individuals that have no missing observations on any of the capabilities and hence its size ( <ref type="formula">473</ref>) is less than the original size. 9 This does not mean that the type of capabilities enjoyed by both are the same. 10 See Section 3 for an explanation of the new categories. Because personality influences the answer to life satisfaction and is not among the explanatory variables of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), it is part of the error term. Let us therefore write the error term ε i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ε i = u i + i<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where u i denotes the individual personality effect 11which makes it possible for an individual to report a different life satisfaction answer from another, even if both have the same capabilitiesand i is an idiosyncratic error term. This yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y i = h Q i ð Þ + u i + i<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>However, as argued above, personality influences the answers to the capability questions as well. That is, if we were to write equations for capabilities, we would have to include these individual effects as part of the explanation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q i = c z i ; x i ð Þ+ u i + v i<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where we will denote</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">w i = u i + v i</formula><p>z i denotes exogenous explanatory factors of capabilities (say L in number), x i are the sociodemographic controls, u i is our personality effect and v i the idiosyncratic error term. We assume that the two idiosyncratic error terms i and v i are not correlated (meaning that it is the presence of u i which accounts for the correlations between the error terms of two equations). Therefore Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) form a simultaneous equations model with the error terms ε i and w i correlated due to the presence of u i . Thus capabilities are endogenous and need to be instrumented. In our setting, the instruments are given by z i and x i (with L + K ≥ M). Now, our data set contains information on past experiences of individuals in many capability domains which constitute a natural choice for our z i variables. Since the questions on these past experiences are very specific to the domain considered, we can exclude a direct relationship with the life satisfaction question. Further, they are 'exogenous' as they concern the past and are factual.</p><p>The above specification assumes that personality effects u i are unobservable. This is the standard way of treating individual effects in economic literature. However if we turn to psychometric literature, personalities can in fact be described using different dimensions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gosling and Rentfrow (2003)</ref> distinguish five major independent personality dimensions: being extravert, agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, and open to experiences. Our data set contains individual measures in all these dimensions on a scale one to seven which can be used for this purpose. Thus one can add a third set of equations which relate these measures to the latent personality in each of these dimensions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P i = π u i ð Þ + ξ i<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where u i can potentially contain more than one individual effect (say p latent personality dimensions). The model comprising Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>), and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>) constitute our main model and will be called variant 1 as defined below.</p><p>Variant 1: This is the latent variable model of Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>), and (6).

The two versions of variant 1, 1a and 1b, reflect the fact that we estimated a number of models with instruments to determine the stability of our estimates with respect to sign and significance. In the main the results appear robust and so for presentational purposes we show two versions: version 1a in which there are as many instruments as capabilities, and version 1b in which there are fewer instruments. 13  Turning to variant 1a, our results show that happiness often depends on capabilities in the direction that one might expect. Being able to imagine the situation of others (C18, say empathy for short), being able to have a concept of a good life based on one's own judgement (C5, say life-autonomy), thinking of oneself as worthless (C13, say self-worth), and losing sleep over worry (C32, say stress) stand out as being statistically significant at the 10% level or lower. The coefficients of the former two capabilities are positive while the latter two have a negative coefficient. These results are robust across other possible specifications of variant 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Past experience</head><p>In variant 1b we see two additional significant variables, namely possible future discrimination and safety. Future possible discrimination on race grounds outside employment (C20) has a negative impact which tends to be significant at low p-values. This would be true for any other discrimination response as answers to questions about discrimination were strongly correlated and hence only one form of discrimination is used in these results. Although the analysis cannot exactly identify the forms of discrimination that matter, it does suggest that discrimination is an important source of unhappinessand for this reason, the capabilities approach and happiness perspectives might agree that discrimination should be a target for policy-interventions albeit for different reasons. The second additional variable, feeling safe while walking alone in day-time (C14, say safety), has the right positive impact (significant at 10%), once again with a strong policy implication that providing a secure environment is a means of making people more satisfied with life.</p><p>It is also possible to make some quantitative comparisons among the different (significant) impacts as all these capability variables are categorical with the same number of categories. Thus we see, from variant 1b which has more significant impacts, that the biggest (absolute) impact on life satisfaction, of going from a lower level of 'capability' to a higher one, occurs for empathy (-0.69), closely followed by self-worth with a coefficient of -0.61. Using the highest coefficient, i.e. that of empathy, as a benchmark (100%), the next important factors are life autonomy (whose coefficient is 75% of that of empathy) and (absence of) discrimination (64%). Then come safety (during day-time) (about 41% of the highest), and finally we have mental stress (25%). In variant 1a where discrimination and safety are absent, the order of impact magnitudeempathy, self-worth, life autonomy, mental stressand their relative importance are almost the same if we only consider the included variables.</p><p>Many other capabilities in the area of political freedom and participation, family support, and housing, are not significant for our sample but come close to being so.</p><p>One anomaly worth noting is a slightly negative relation between socialising capabilities and life satisfaction. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> this relates to being able to make lasting friendships (C9) though other regressions with slightly different variables suggest a similar issue. Given that we have, in effect, a relatively large number of controls or variables in our equations, it is difficult for us to rationalise this result and it remains open to further investigation.</p><p>Among the five different personality traits that were included in the capability-happiness equation, being open to experiences and being emotionally stable have significant impacts on life satisfaction. This suggests that while the five different traits do describe distinct dimensions of personality, it is not necessary that all of them play an important role in life satisfaction.</p><p>What we can say from variants 1a and 1b, in line with previous recent research but this time addressing endogeneity, is that happiness (life satisfaction) is highly multi-dimensional, clearly depends on various aspects of autonomy and is strongly associated with social aspects of life.</p><p>Turning to variants 2 and 3<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> , there is a striking similarity between the results of these two modelsboth in terms of their coefficients and in terms of their significance. Thus one can conclude that even though some personality traits are significant in capability-happiness equations, their direct in-or exclusion has little impact on the remaining coefficients.</p><p>If we compare variant 1 with the other two (which ignore endogeneity), we find a mixture of differences and similarities. For example, the impact of having lost sleep is negative in variant 1 but not significant in variants 2 and 3. Similarly, being able to put oneself in the shoes of others has a strongly positive impact in variant 1 but is insignificant in variants 2 and 3. Conversely, enjoying family support is significant and positive in variants 2 and 3 but not significant in variant 1. The same is true for being able to express feelings and having a week's holiday. However, despite the variability in terms of statistical significance the coefficients normally have the sign that might be expected.</p><p>Thus we do see a notable difference in estimation results between treating capabilities as endogenous or not. More specifically, the former approach stresses more on capability indicators that relate to general aspects of lifenot having any serious worry, empathising with others, being able to make own judgments in life, not feeling worthless, not suffering discriminationfor leading a happy life whereas the latter leaves out some of these general features but brings out some particular aspects such as having a week's holiday or enjoying family support etc.</p><p>Finally, the results of the capability equations <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">15</ref> show that all the capabilities are significantly affected by at least one or two personality traits. This finding emphasizes the endogenous nature of capabilities in our life satisfaction model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding remarks</head><p>In this paper, we report the development of a survey instrument to measure individual freedoms of adults and its application in Argentina to create a unique dataset for adult capabilities. The paper then uses this data to generate an index of capabilities, across a wide range of life domains, and develops a generalized latent variable framework to estimate the impact of capabilities on life satisfaction, whilst allowing for unobserved heterogeneity and potential endogeneity. Substantively, we find that empathy and self-esteem are the biggest relative contributors to happiness in our sample. These are closely followed by goal autonomy (with an impact of about 75% of the first factor). Potential future discrimination seems to be the next important consideration (64%) for Argentineans. Finally, our study points out that safety and stress also matter significantly for life satisfaction though the magnitude of their impact is less than half of 'empathy'. Broadly speaking, these results are robust both in models presented as in others that are available in a longer version of the paperand they help to identify perhaps for the first time a range of determinants of happiness that add to what we know about the role of relative income 12 We do not report the results of the first stage instrumentation equations (the arrows from sociodemographics and past experience to capabilities) nor the results of the personality measurement equations (the arrows from the latent individual personality to the box of observed personality traits capabilities) for reasons of space. 13 Recall that the capabilities-happiness model also includes equations explaining capabilities using past experiences and socio-demographic controls that serve as instruments. To ensure there are enough instruments, it is impossible to include all capability indicators in the happiness equation. In some cases it was possible to drop capability indicators on the grounds they were strongly correlated with other indicators. In some other cases, capability indicators were dropped on the grounds that their coefficients in capability-happiness equations were not significantly different from zero. and unemployment. However, it is also worth noting that none of these, with the exception of stress, yield a statistically significant relation with income in the process of instrumentation indicating that not all aspects of the welfare outcome can be assumed to be positively and closely related to financial income.</p><p>These results, if replicated, are interesting because they identify some important common ground between the capabilities approach to welfare economics which emphasizes the value of positive freedoms and the utilitarian approach which advocates maximizing the sum of individual happiness. Both approaches can advocate developing policies that prioritise the six aspects of a person's freedom mentioned abovealbeit for different reasons. From a capabilities perspective, value would derive from the fact these are freedoms a person has reason to value whereas from a utilitarian perspective, these are freedoms that make people happy. This particular list is not obvious a priori and raises questions about the promotion of policies that focus solely on monetary indicators of welfare. There is already some consensus that economic growth should be sensitive to distributional concerns (pro poor) as well as environmental impacts (green) but findings such as ours underline a third issue, namely that we should check that growth is delivering the welfare outcome (quality-of-life) improvements that most economists hope for.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B Variant 1 for categorical variables</head><p>As the life satisfaction variable is categorical, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) has two parts as follows. Our response variable y i takes four values 0,1,2,3 corresponding respectively to four categoriesdissatisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, fairly satisfied, very satisfied. Thus we have</p><p>for c = 0, 1, 2, 3 where τ c , c = 0, 1, 2, 3 are endogenous thresholds with τ 0 = -∞ and τ 4 = ∞ and where y i Ã represents the underlying continuous response variable explained by capabilities as follows:</p><p>where u i is the vector of individual effects and e i is assumed to follow a normal distribution (probit link) of unit variance. Then we can write:</p><p>Next our capability measures. Each capability is either a binary response variable or an ordered categorical variable. For the categorical variable the procedure is the same as for the life satisfaction response variable. Denoting it as Q j, i , we have:</p><p>where Q j, i Ã is a latent capability variable such that:</p><p>for j = 1,..., M. We assume that e j, i are independent across dimensions and individuals and independent of e i . For a binary capability variable, the latent model is even simpler. We have:</p><p>Finally the measurement model for personality dimensions. There are ten personality traits (T = 10) which can be divided into five pairs corresponding to five different aspects of an individual's personality (p = 5) according to <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Each pair consists of answers to a particular aspect and its opposite. All answers are scaled from 1 to 7 with 1 indicating 'strongly disagree' and 7 'strongly agree'. These pairs are as follows:</p><p>Pair 1: Being extravert: I see myself as extravert (PT1) and see myself as reserved, quiet (PT6) Pair 2: Being agreeable: I see myself as critical, quarrelsome (PT2) and I see myself as sympathetic and warm (PT7) Pair 3: Being conscientious: I see myself as dependable, selfdisciplined (PT3) and I see myself as disorganised, careless (PT8) Pair 4: Being emotionally stable: I see myself as anxious, easily upset (PT4) and I see myself as calm, emotionally stable (PT9) Pair 5: Being open to experiences: I see myself as open to new experiences, complex (PT5) and I see myself as conventional, uncreative (PT10)</p><p>For our variant 1, we have five latent factors u 1 to u 5 corresponding to each personality dimension and each latent factor u ji , j = 1,..., 5 is measured by the corresponding pair of personality indicators say PTm ji and PTn ji . Thus our measurement model is given by:</p><p>The complete model comprising ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) is estimated by maximum likelihood (ML). Due to its computational complexity and because independence is assumed between ξ jm, i and ξ jn, i , j = 1,..., 5 and (e i , e j, i , j = 1,..., M) ∀ j, i, the ML procedure can be implemented in two stages. In a first stage factor analysis is performed for Eq. ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) in order to obtain estimates of individual scores u ˆj;i ; j = 1; :::; 5. In a second stage the individual effects u ji are replaced by their estimates in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and these equations estimated by ML. These new variables N1,...,N5 can theoretically range from -6 to 6 which are directly included in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and the equation is estimated by ordered probit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variant 3</head><p>This is a reduced version of variant 2 without personality traits and hence also estimated by ordered probit.</p></div>			</div>
