<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Latent variables are random variables whose realized values are hidden. Their properties must thus be inferred indirectly using a statistical model connecting the latent (unobserved) variables to observed variables. Somewhat unfortunately, latent variables are referred to by different names in different parts of statistics, examples including 'random effects <ref type="bibr">', 'common factors', 'latent classes', 'underlying variables' and 'frailties'.</ref> Latent variable modelling has gradually become an integral part of mainstream statistics and is currently used for a multitude of applications in different subject areas. Examples include, to name a few, longitudinal analysis (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Verbeke &amp; Molenberghs, 2000)</ref>, covariate measurement error (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Carroll et al., 2006)</ref>, multivariate survival (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Hougaard, 2000)</ref>, market segmentation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wedel &amp; Kamakura, 2000)</ref>, psychometric measurement (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">McDonald, 1999)</ref>, meta-analysis (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Sutton et al., 2000)</ref>, capture-recapture (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Coull &amp; Agresti, 1999)</ref>, discrete choice (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Train, 2003)</ref>, biometrical genetics (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Neale &amp; Cardon, 1992)</ref> and spatial statistics (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Rue &amp; Held, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, the Danish statistician Erling B. Andersen published an important survey of latent variable modelling in the Scandinavian Journal of Statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Andersen, 1982)</ref>. Andersen called his paper 'Latent Structure Analysis: A Survey', an aptly chosen title as his survey was confined to the type of models discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Lazarsfeld &amp; Henry (1968)</ref> in their seminal book 'Latent Structure Analysis'. Specifically, Andersen focused on latent trait models (where the latent variable is continuous, whereas observed variables are categorical) popular in educational testing and latent class models (where both the latent variable and the observed variables are categorical) stemming from sociology, but some space was also devoted to the rather esoteric latent profile models (where the latent variable is categorical, whereas the observed variables are continuous). <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Lazarsfeld &amp; Henry (1968)</ref> mentioned factor models (where both latent and observed variables are continuous) only very briefly and, in line with this, Andersen excluded these models from his survey. This is remarkable as factor models are the most popular latent variable models in psychology.</p><p>The simple type of latent variable model considered by Andersen connects a single latent variable j for unit (e.g. person) j to observed variables y j = (y 1j , y 2j , . . ., y nj ) . A basic construction principle of latent variable models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Arminger &amp; K üsters, 1989)</ref> is the specification of conditional independence of the observed variables given the latent variable (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">McDonald, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Lazarsfeld &amp; Henry, 1968)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pr(y j | j ) = n i = 1 Pr(y ij | j ).</formula><p>This particular form of conditional independence is often called 'local independence'.</p><p>A very succinct representation of such a latent variable model is in terms of a path diagram as shown for three observed variables in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Circles represent latent variables, rectangles represent observed variables, arrows connecting circles and/or rectangles represent (linear or nonlinear) regressions, and short arrows pointing at circles or rectangles represent (not necessarily additive) residual variability.</p><p>A limitation of Andersen's survey was that only simple latent variable models with a single latent variable were considered. Nothing was said about multidimensional factor models or the important synthesis of common factor models and structural equation models pioneered by the fellow Scandinavian statistician Karl G. J öreskog. Furthermore, mixed or random effects models, and covariate measurement error models were omitted from the survey. In the present survey, we fill these gaps and discuss some major subsequent developments in latent variable modelling.</p><p>The plan of the paper is as follows. We start by surveying more or less traditional latent variable models. We then discuss how different kinds of latent variable models have gradually converged by borrowing features from other models. Recognizing the similar mathematical structure of latent variable models, unifying frameworks for latent variable modelling have been developed and we describe one such framework. Finally, we survey some extensions of latent variable modelling such as multilevel structural equation models with both continuous and discrete latent variables, multiprocess models and nonlinear latent variable models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Traditional latent variable models</head><p>The classification scheme of traditional latent variable models presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> is useful to keep in mind in the sequel. We discuss latent class, item-response and factor models in the same section on measurement models because in all the three models the latent variables can be thought of as representing 'true' variables or constructs, and the observed variables as indirect or fallible measures. In the subsequent sections, we discuss structural equation models, linear mixed models and covariate measurement error models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Latent class models</head><p>Consider j = 1, . . ., N independent units. In latent class models, a latent categorical variable is measured with error by a set of categorical variables y ij , i = 1, . . ., n. The categories of the latent variable represent labels for C subpopulations or latent classes, c = 1, . . ., C, with class membership probabilities c . To simplify the notation, we consider binary response variables here.</p><p>In the exploratory latent class model, the conditional response probability for measure i, given latent class membership c, is specified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Pr(y ij = 1 | c) = i | c ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where i | c are free parameters. The responses y ij and y i j are conditionally independent given class membership.</p><p>As a function of the parameters = ( 1 , 1 | 1 , . . ., n|1 , . . . , C , 1|C , . . ., n|C ) , the marginal likelihood becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">l M ( ) = N j = 1 Pr(y j ; ) = N j = 1 C c = 1 c n i = 1 Pr(y ij | c) = N j = 1 C c = 1 c n i = 1 y ij i|c (1 -i|c ) 1-y ij .</formula><p>It is evident that the latent class model is a multivariate finite mixture model with C components.</p><p>An important application of latent class models is in medical diagnosis where both latent classes (disease versus no disease) and the sets of measurements (diagnostic test results) are dichotomous (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Rindskopf &amp; Rindskopf, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>A latent profile model for continuous responses has the same structure as an exploratory latent class model, but with a different conditional response distribution,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y ij | c ∼ N( i|c , 2 i ).</formula><p>Historical notes. The formalization of latent class models is due to Lazarsfeld (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lazarsfeld, 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Lazarsfeld &amp; Henry, 1968)</ref>, although models used as early as the nineteenth century (e.g. Peirce, 1884) can be viewed as special cases. Lazarsfeld also appears to have introduced the terms 'manifest' and 'latent' variables for observed and unobserved variables, respectively. A rigorous statistical treatment of latent class modelling was given by <ref type="bibr">Goodman (1974a,b)</ref> who specified the models as log-linear models and considered maximum-likelihood estimation. The latent profile model was introduced by Green ( <ref type="formula">1952</ref>), but the term was coined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Gibson (1959)</ref>. An early reference to finite mixture models is <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Pearson (1894)</ref>, even though earlier writings by Quetelet and other nineteenth century statisticians mention such approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Item-response theory (IRT) models</head><p>Consider now the case where a latent continuous variable or 'latent trait' j is measured with error by a set of categorical variables usually called items. The canonical example is from educational testing where the items are exam questions, y ij is '1' if examinee j answered item i correctly and '0' otherwise, and j represents the ability of the examinee.</p><p>One-parameter IRT model. In the simplest IRT model, the one-parameter logistic (1-PL) model, the conditional response probability for item i, given ability j , is specified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Pr(y ij = 1 | j ) = exp( j -b i ) 1 + exp( j -b i ) .</formula><p>This model is called a 'one-parameter model' because there is one parameter, the 'item difficulty' b i , for each item.</p><p>If it is assumed that ability is a random variable with a normal distribution, j ∼ N(0, ), integrating out the latent variable produces the marginal likelihood:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">l M (b, ) = N j = 1 Pr(y j ; b, ) = N j = 1 ∞ -∞ n i = 1 Pr(y ij | j )g( j ; ) d j = N j = 1 ∞ -∞ n i = 1 exp( j -b i ) y ij 1 + exp( j -b i ) g( j ; ) d j ,</formula><p>where b is the vector of item difficulties and g(•; ) is the normal density with zero mean and variance .</p><p>Alternatively, the j can be treated as unknown fixed parameters giving the so-called Rasch model. An incidental parameter problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Neyman &amp; Scott, 1948)</ref> occurs if 'incidental parameters' j are estimated jointly with the 'structural parameters' b, producing inconsistent estimators for b. Inference can instead be based on a conditional likelihood l C (b) constructed by conditioning on the sufficient statistic for j ; the sum score t j = n i = 1 y ij . The conditional likelihood can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">l C (b) = N j = 1 Pr(y j ; b | t j ) = N j = 1 n i = 1 exp(-b i y ij ) d j ∈B(t j ) n i = 1 exp(-b i d ij )</formula><p>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B(t j ) = d j = (d 1j , . . ., d nj ) : d ij = 0 or 1, n i = 1 d ij = t j</formula><p>is the set of all distinct sequences d j of zeroes and ones with sum t j . Clusters with t j = 0 or t j = n do not contribute to the likelihood as their conditional probabilities become 1.</p><p>An appealing feature of one-parameter models is that items and examinees can be placed on a common scale (according to the difficulty and ability parameters) so that the probability of a correct response depends only on the amount jb i by which the examinee's position exceeds the item's position. Differences in difficulty between items are the same for all Scand J Statist 34 examinees, and differences in abilities of two examinees are the same for all items, a property called 'specific objectivity' by Rasch. For a given item, the probability of a correct response increases monotonically with ability as shown in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Additionally, we see that for each ability, performance decreases with difficulty. The model is therefore said to exhibit 'double monotonicity'.</p><p>Two-parameter IRT model. Although the 1-PL model is simple and elegant, it is often deemed to be unrealistic in practice. A more general model, incorporating the 1-PL model as a special case, is the two-parameter logistic (2-PL) model specified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Pr(y ij = 1 | j ) = exp[a i ( j -b i )] 1 + exp[a i ( j -b i )]</formula><p>.</p><p>The model is called a 'two-parameter model' because there are two parameters for each item, a discrimination parameter a i and a difficulty parameter b i . The latent variable or ability is usually assumed to have a normal distribution j ∼ N(0, 1). It should be noted that a conditional likelihood can no longer be constructed as there is no sufficient statistic for j and the marginal likelihood is hence used. Item characteristic curves for the 2-PL model are shown for different difficulties and discrimination parameters in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Note that the 2-PL model does not share the double monotonicity property of the 1-PL model. An item can be easier than another item for low abilities but more difficult than the other item for higher abilities due to the item-examinee interaction a i j .</p><p>An alternative, and very similar model, is the normal ogive</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Pr(y ij = 1 | j ) = (a i ( j -b i )),</formula><p>where (•) is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.</p><p>More complex IRT models include the three-parameter logistic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Birnbaum, 1968</ref>) which accommodates guessing, the partial credit <ref type="bibr">(Masters, 1982)</ref>, rating scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Andrich, 1978)</ref> and graded response <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Samejima, 1969)</ref> models for ordinal responses and the nominal response model (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Rasch, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bock, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Andersen, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>Historical notes. The 'latent trait' terminology is due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Lazarsfeld (1954)</ref> whereas the term 'item-response theory' (IRT) was coined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Lord (1980)</ref>. Lord was instrumental in developing statistical models for ability testing (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Lord, 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Lord &amp; Novick, 1968</ref>), mainly considering the now obsolete approach of joint maximum-likelihood estimation of abilities and item parameters (a i and b i ). Two approaches are used to circumvent the incidental parameter problem. The Dane Georg Rasch <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Rasch, 1960)</ref> suggested conditional maximum-likelihood estimation for the 1-PL model and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Andersen (1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Andersen ( , 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Andersen ( , 1973</ref><ref type="bibr">Andersen ( , 1980) )</ref> provided a rigorous statistical treatment of this approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bock &amp; Lieberman (1970)</ref> introduced marginal maximum-likelihood estimation and Gauss-Hermite quadrature in latent variable modelling, focusing on the two-parameter normal ogive model introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Lawley (1943) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Lord (1952)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Common factor models</head><p>A vector of continuous latent variables or 'common factors' is indirectly observed via a vector of continuous observed variables, x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . ., x q ) .

It is finally assumed that cov( , ) = 0.</p><p>It should be noted that it would be preferable to include a vector of parameters for the expectations of x in the common factor model. This vector is usually omitted because, with complete data, it can be profiled out of the likelihood by substituting the sample means.</p><p>x is in this case taken as mean centred.</p><p>The covariance structure of x, called the 'factor structure', becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">= cov(x) = x x + .

F ML is non-negative and zero only if there is a perfect fit = S.</p><p>The common factors are often interpreted as 'hypothetical constructs' measured indirectly by the observed variables x. Hypothetical constructs are legion in the social sciences, an important example from psychology being the 'big-five theory of personality' <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985)</ref> comprising the constructs 'openness to experience <ref type="bibr">', 'conscientiousness', 'extraversion', 'agreeableness' and 'neuroticism'. Friedman's (1957)</ref> notion of 'permanent income' is an example from economics.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between two approaches to common factor modelling: exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA is an inductive approach for 'discovering' the number of common factors and estimating the model parameters, imposing a minimal number of constraints for identification. The standard Scand J Statist 34 Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Independent clusters factor model. identifying constraints are that = I, and that and x -1</p><p>x are both diagonal. Although mathematically convenient, the one-size-fits-all parameter restrictions imposed in EFA, particularly the specification of uncorrelated common factors, are often not meaningful from a subject matter point of view.</p><p>In CFA, restrictions are imposed based on substantive theory or research design. An important example is the 'independent clusters model' where x has many elements set to zero such that each variable measures one and only one factor. A path diagram of a two-factor independent clusters model with three variables measuring each factor is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Here the double-headed, curved error denotes a covariance between the two common factors.</p><p>The scales of the common factors are fixed either by 'factor standardization' where variances of the common factors are fixed to 1 (as in EFA) or by 'anchoring' where one factor loading for each factor is fixed to 1 as in the figure. Elements of may be correlated, but special care must be exercised in this case to ensure that the model is identified.</p><p>In a unidimensional factor model, the common factor may represent a true variable measured with error, such as a person's true blood pressure fallibly measured by several measures. When measure-specific intercepts (x)   i are included, we obtain the 'congeneric measurement model',</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">x i = (x) i + (x) i + i .</formula><p>The reliability i , the fraction of true score variance to total variance, for a particular measure</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x i becomes i = ( (x) i ) 2 ( (x) i ) 2 + ( ) ii .</formula><p>The congeneric measurement model has several important nested special cases. The 'essentially tau-equivalent measurement model' prescribes that the measures are on the same scale</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">( (x) i = (x) ),</formula><p>the 'tau-equivalent measurement model' that the measures also have the same means</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">( (x) i = (x) , (x) i = (x) )</formula><p>and the 'parallel measurement model' that the measurement error variances are also equal for all measures</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">( (x) i = (x) , (x) i = (x) , ( ) ii = ( ) ).</formula><p>The parallel measurement model is also the model from classical (psychometric) test theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Gulliksen, 1950)</ref>.</p><p>Historical notes. The invention of factor analysis is attributed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Spearman (1904)</ref> who argued that intelligence was composed of a general factor, common to all subdomains such as mathematics, music, etc., and specific factors for each of the subdomains.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Multilevel structural equation models</head><p>In multilevel data, the units are nested in clusters, leading to within-cluster dependence. The traditional approach to extending structural equation models to the multilevel setting is to formulate separate within-cluster and between-cluster models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Longford &amp; Muthén, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Poon &amp; Lee, 1992)</ref>. Let y ik be the vector of continuous responses for unit i in cluster k. Then the within-cluster model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">y ik ∼ N( k , W (ϑ W )), (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_64">)</formula><p>where k is the mean vector for cluster k and the within-cluster covariance structure W (ϑ W ) is structured by a within-cluster structural equation model with parameters ϑ W .

An advantage of this set-up is that it allows software for conventional structural equation models to be 'tricked' into estimating the model. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Muthén (1989)</ref> suggests an approach which corresponds to maximum likelihood for balanced data where all clusters have the same size n. This approach as well as an ad hoc solution for the unbalanced case are described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Muthén (1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Goldstein (2003)</ref> describes another ad hoc approach, using multivariate multilevel modelling to estimate W and B consistently by either maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. Structural equation models can then be fitted separately to each estimated matrix.</p><p>Unfortunately, the standard implementation of the within-and between-model approaches is limited in several ways. First, it is confined to continuous responses. Multilevel factor models for dichotomous and ordinal measures, or equivalently, multilevel item-response models, have been used by, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ansari &amp; Jedidi (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Rabe-Hesketh et al.

A second limitation of the standard within-and betweenmodel is that it does not permit cross-level paths from latent or observed variables at a higher level to latent or observed variables at a lower level, although such effects will often be of primary interest. Thirdly, it does not allow for indicators varying at different levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Fox &amp; Glas (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2004)</ref> overcome these limitations. For instance, the GLLAMM framework described in section 4 includes cross-level effects among latent variables via the B matrix in the structural model and can handle indicators and latent variables varying at an arbitrary number of levels in the response model. As an illustration of a model requiring these features, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows a multilevel structural equation model considered by <ref type="bibr">Rabe-Hesketh et al.

It is regressed on observed student-level covariates w jk with regression parameter vector (the vector version of ). Student-level ability is also regressed on a school-level latent variable 'teacher excellence', measured by school-level ordinal items, with cross-level regression parameter b 12 .

For instance, subjects with a poor prognosis (unobserved heterogeneity) may self-select into the treatment perceived to be best. It is hardly surprising that conventional modelling in this case can produce severely biased estimates of the treatment effect. Hence, models attempting to correct for selection bias by jointly modelling the outcome and treatment processes, often called endogenous treatment models, have been suggested in econometrics (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Heckman, 1978)</ref>.</p><p>The outcome model for y j is specified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">g(E(y j | x j , j )) = T j + x j 1 + j ,</formula><p>where T j is a dummy for treatment with corresponding parameter and x j a vector of covariates with parameter vector 1 . j ∼ N(0, ) is a latent variable representing unobserved heterogeneity that is shared between the outcome and treatment processes and is a factor loading.

For the treatment model, a probit link and a Bernoulli distribution are typically specified. Different types of parameter constraints are necessary for identification depending on the type of response y i . For a dichotomous or continuous response y i , we set = 1. For a continuous response, we also use a scaled probit link for the treatment model with scale set equal to the residual standard deviation of y i (see <ref type="bibr">Skrondal &amp; Rabe-Hesketh, 2004, p. 108)</ref>.</p><p>A path diagram of a model with an endogenous covariate is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.

In the latter case, the response at time 2 is represented by a latent variable y * 2 . This approach can be viewed literally as correcting for missing data that are NMAR. However, as the estimation of 1 relies heavily on the distributional assumption for y ij , it might be advisable to instead interpret the results as a sensitivity analysis of the MAR assumption.</p><p>Random coefficient-based dropout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Wu &amp; Carroll (1988)</ref> consider a linear growth model for the longitudinal data with a subject-specific random intercept b 0j and slope of time b 1j . The term 0 b 0j + 1 b 1j is included in the dropout model, where 0 and 1 are unknown parameters that could be viewed as factor loadings. This type of model has also been referred to as a 'shared parameter model' by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Follmann &amp; Wu (1995)</ref>.</p><p>Another specification is to treat the subject-specific mean b 0j + b 1j t ij in the linear mixed model as a covariate in the dropout model, interpreting the subject-specific mean as the 'latent process' or true response with measurement error removed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Faucett &amp; Thomas, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Xu &amp; Zeger, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Ten <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Have et al. (2000)</ref> specify a two-level unidimensional common factor model for a multivariate dichotomous response with a subject-specific random intercept which is also included in the dropout model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Nonlinear latent variable models</head><p>In this section, we consider models that are nonlinear in the latent variables and possibly in the parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1.">Nonlinear mixed models</head><p>Nonlinear mixed models are used either because theory prescribes a particular functional form, as, for instance in compartment models for drug absorption, distribution and elimination (see below) or because the relationship between the response and explanatory variable(s) cannot be well approximated by a polynomial, due to asymptotes, inflection points or other features.</p><p>The models usually have the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">y ij = f (t ij , j ) + ij , ij ∼ N(0, 2 ) j = X j + Z j b j , b j ∼ N(0, G),<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where f (•) is some nonlinear function, t ij is a covariate vector, X j and Z j are covariate matrices, are fixed effects and b j are random effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Davidian &amp; Giltinan (2003)</ref> discuss the following one-compartment model for the blood concentration of an anti-asthmatic agent t ij time units after the administration of the drug,</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">y ij = Dk j V j (k j -C j /V j ) {exp(-k j t ij ) -exp(-C i t ij /V j )} + ij ,</formula><p>where k j is the fractional rate of absorption from the gut into the bloodstream, V j is roughly the volume required to account for all drug in the body and C j is the clearance rate, representing the volume of blood from which the drug is eliminated per time unit. The model for the vector of subject-specific random parameters j = (ln k j , ln V j , ln C j ) has the form of (31) with Z j = I 3 . We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Davidian &amp; Giltinan (2003)</ref> for a useful recent overview of nonlinear mixed effects models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2.">Nonlinear factor models</head><p>Nonlinear factor models for continuous responses (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bartlett, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">McDonald, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Yalcin &amp; Amemiya, 2001)</ref> have been proposed to relax the standard linearity specification. The vector of responses x j is modelled as</p><p>x j = x j + j , j ≡ g( j ), where g( j ) is a known deterministic vector function and normality is often assumed for j and j . Special cases include polynomial factor models where j = ( j , 2 j , . . ., p j ) , and models with (first-order) interactions where j = ( 1j , 2j , . . ., qj , 1j 2j , 1j 3j , . . ., q-1, j qj ) .</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Etezadi-Amoli &amp; McDonald (1983)</ref> consider a two-factor model for aphasic dysfunction where the first factor is interpreted as a general factor and the second as a verbal-non-verbal bipolar factor. The responses are a cubic function of the first factor, a linear function of the second factor and the interaction between the two factors.</p><p>A novel idea would be to extend multilevel structural equation models to include products of latent variables varying at different levels. For instance, consider a latent variable (2)   jk for unit j in cluster k and a latent variable (3)  k for cluster k. A product term such as ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">3</ref>) k</p><p>(2) jk could then represent either (i) a cross-level interaction of latent covariates (3)  k and (2) jk ; (ii) a random coefficient (3)  k of a latent covariate (2)  jk ; or (iii) a latent variable (2)  jk with random, cluster-specific, standard deviation (3)  k .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.3.">Nonlinear structural equation models</head><p>Structural models that are nonlinear in the latent variables have also been proposed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Kenny &amp; Judd, 1984)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Arminger &amp; Muthén (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Lee &amp; Zhu (2002)</ref>, among others, discuss nonlinear versions of the LISREL model for continuous responses (see section 2.2). The structural model for latent response variables j in terms of the latent explanatory variables j is given by j = B j + j + j , j ≡ g( j ).</p><p>As for nonlinear factor models, g( j ) is a known deterministic vector function and normality is typically assumed for j and j . An example of a nonlinear relationship between latent variables is discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Wall &amp; Amemiya (2000)</ref> where the effect of parenting skills on children's self-restraint is large for low parenting skills and eventually levels off. <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Wall &amp; Amemiya (2007)</ref> provide a recent overview of nonlinear structural equation modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding remarks</head><p>Although our survey has been quite extensive, reflecting the major developments since <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Andersen (1982)</ref>, we do not claim that it is exhaustive. For instance, we have omitted model types such as state-space models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jones, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Durbin &amp; Koopman, 2001)</ref>, Bayesian models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Fox &amp; Glas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Lee &amp; Song, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Dunson &amp; Herring, 2005)</ref> and spatial models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Knorr-Held &amp; Best, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Christensen &amp; Amemiya, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Liu et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>We have not discussed identification and equivalence which are important challenges in latent variable modelling (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Dupac ǒvá &amp; Wold, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Rabe-Hesketh &amp; Skrondal, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Skrondal &amp; Rabe-Hesketh, 2004, Chapter 5)</ref>. Roughly speaking, identification concerns whether the parameters of a specific model are unique in the sense that there is only one set of parameter values that can produce a given probability distribution, whereas equivalence concerns whether different models can produce identical probability distributions.</p><p>Regarding models with continuous latent variables, we have focused on the standard multivariate normal case. Approaches to relaxing this assumption include using multivariate t-distributions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Pinheiro et al., 2001)</ref>, finite mixtures of normal distributions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Uebersax, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Magder &amp; Zeger, 1996)</ref>, truncated Hermite series expansions (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Gallant &amp;</ref> Scand J Statist 34 <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nychka, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Davidian &amp; Gallant, 1992)</ref>, non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Lindsay, 1995)</ref>, other non-normal distributions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Lee &amp; Nelder, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Wedel &amp; Kamakura, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Lee et al., 2006)</ref> or, in a Bayesian setting, semiparametric mixtures of Dirichlet processes (e.g. M üller <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">&amp; Roeder, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we have not discussed the estimation of latent variable models and therefore give a very brief outline here. When the marginal distribution of the responses is multivariate normal, maximum-likelihood estimation is relatively straightforward because the marginal likelihood can be written in closed form. In non-normal models, such at item-response models, there is generally no analytic expression for the likelihood (exceptions being models with conjugate latent variable distributions). In this case, the integrals are typically approximated in one of three ways: (i) Laplace approximation and penalized quasi likelihood (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Breslow &amp; Clayton, 1993</ref>); (ii) numerical integration (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bock &amp; Lieberman, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Rabe-Hesketh et al., 2005)</ref>; or (iii) Monte Carlo integration (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Meng &amp; Schilling, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Train, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Lee &amp; Song, 2004)</ref>. For models with multivariate normal latent responses, such as that shown in (17), <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Muthén (1984)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Muthén &amp; Satorra (1996)</ref> developed a limited-information approach based on univariate and bivariate marginal distributions. Markov chain Monte Carlo has also been used (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Zeger &amp; Karim, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Lee, 2007)</ref>, typically with vague prior distributions. We refer to <ref type="bibr">Skrondal &amp; Rabe-Hesketh (2004, Chapter 6)</ref> for a comprehensive treatment of the estimation of latent variable models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
