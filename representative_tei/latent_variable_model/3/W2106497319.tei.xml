In many cases, estimating unknown rates of introduction and spread from observed data requires evaluating intractable variable-dimensional integrals. In general, inference on the large class of models containing latent variables of large or variable dimension precludes exact sampling techniques. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods provide an alternative to exact sampling but rely on inefficient conditional simulation of the latent variables.

This information is critical for projection of future expansion and for development of appropriate management strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, in cases where long-term temporal data is unavailable, current distribution patterns of non-native species can be used to infer how the invasion process may have occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>Invasions that occur below-ground, such as earthworm invasions, can be particularly difficult to track over time and may initially proceed unnoticed.</p><p>Non-native earthworms are currently spreading in many forests across North America <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> but have limited ability to disperse actively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Therefore, passive jump dispersal via abandonment of bait by anglers and transport along roads via vehicle traffic is thought to be important in their spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. In northern hardwood and boreal forests, which are devoid of native earthworm species, earthworm invasions are causing significant changes to nutrient cycling and soil structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. These changes have led to cascading effects on songbird <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and plant communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Because earthworms can affect other species directly, as well as indirectly via changes in the physical environment, their invasions may cause substantial changes over a large area of the Canadian boreal forest in the future. Accurate estimates of earthworm introduction and spread rates in this region are thus critical for the development of appropriate management strategies.</p><p>For many invasive species, spread occurs via a combination of diffusive spread around invaded sites and jump dispersal to new locations (i.e., stratified diffusion; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). Because even rare long-distance jump dispersal events result in faster spread than would be expected with diffusive spread alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, estimates of both introduction and spread rates are typically needed to predict the future spatial extent of an invasive species. Introductions of invasive species can be described using point process models, while models for diffusive spread following an introduction are application-dependent and can be complex (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). As a result, data likelihoods for such models are not often available in closed form.</p><p>Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>) has proven to be a useful approach for approximate inference on intractable likelihood problems, including distinguishing among introduction scenarios and invasion routes of non-native species (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>). It relies on repeated model simulation in the absence of an explicit likelihood function. Proposed parameter values are accepted or rejected based on the distance between low-dimensional summaries of a conditional model realization and the observed data.</p><p>ABC algorithms are generally computationally intensive, and can result in unreliable estimates when too few proposals are accepted (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, lemma 1).</p><p>Existing implementations typically construct a Markov chain with a dependent proposal mechanism defined on a fixed probability space <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, in many models, the dimensionality of the parameter space varies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. In this paper we develop a transdimensional ABC algorithm that allows efficient exploration of parameter subspaces of variable dimension. This approach is applied to estimate introduction and spread rates of non-native earthworms in the boreal forest.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes a general point-process model for introduction of an invasive species and its subsequent spread. As the likelihood function is an intractable integral of variable dimension, a basic ABC algorithm for obtaining a sample from an approximate posterior distribution associated with this model is described. The novel transdimensional ABC approach is then presented as an efficient alternative to existing sampling methods. Section 3 introduces the motivating problem of estimating the rates of introduction and spread of the earthworm species Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny) in northern Alberta by combining information from two datasets. The hierarchical model of the population dynamics is described, and algorithmic implementation details are provided. Inference results are summarized in Section 4, and are then utilized in a spatio-temporal simulation model to project the extent of invasion in a sample region in Section 5. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Approximate Bayesian Computation</head><p>Let us consider a model for the invasion of a non-native species over a given region with the vector of unknown model parameters, θ, such as rates of introduction, birth, predation, or spread.

In practice, evaluating p(Y | x k , θ) is often infeasible, especially under complex models for interaction and spread, or when the data is only partially observed in space. Furthermore, the domain of integration in (2) changes dimension with the dimension of the latent variable, leading to further difficulties in obtaining a closed form likelihood. For the motivating invasive species model in Section 3, even under simple deterministic linear spread in one dimension, evaluating the likelihood (2) presents a geometric and combinatorial challenge whose complexity renders exact inference practically limited. As a result, approximate simulation-based inference, such as ABC, often becomes the only tool available to approach such problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model inference for earthworm invasions</head><p>We now propose a model for the invasion of earthworms along one spatial dimension over time. Our framework is applicable for any model with a latent variable structure, requiring integration with respect to parameters of variable dimension, as long as data can be obtained by forward-simulation from the model.</p><p>The 78 observation transects were grouped into eight categories based on their spatial location on the landscape (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Each of these groups contained young, intermediate-aged, and old roads. Observations Y gr ∈ {0, 1} 6 for road r = 1, . . . , n g in group g = 1, . . . , 8 consist of binary error-free measurements of presence or absence at the sampled 6 quadrats of the corresponding transect. For notational clarity, we omit dependence of the introduction locations on k and instead define x gr to be the value of x k associated with group g and road r.</p><p>For every road in the study, we model earthworm introductions and spread over the spatio-temporal horizon H gr , defined by the largest possible extent of activity that can affect the observed data under our model, as shown in Figure x (1)   x (2)   Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Simulation horizon, H gr , consisting of all spatio-temporal locations where an introduction event will affect the data according to our spread model. Two introductions and subsequent spread are shown shaded in grey. The data generated by the illustrated invasion is m (x gr , ν, T gr ) = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0].</p><p>3. We assume that the introduction rate is constant within each of the 8 selected road groups per unit area of H gr by modelling the k introductions according to a homogeneous space-time Poisson process with rate λ g × Area of H gr ∈ R + , measured in introductions/(m×yr) to account for different road ages.</p><p>For a T gr -year-old road, earthworms are assumed to spread linearly in time from point-source locations, x gr , at an unknown constant rate, ν ∈ R + (measured in m/yr), defining the geometry of the horizon H gr = H(ν, T gr ) ∈ R 2 . If earthworms spread far enough from x gr to overlap with a sampling quadrat, a presence indicator is recorded as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We denote the resulting presence or absence of worms at the measurement locations by m(x gr , ν, T gr ).</p><p>Since we assume that presence or absence of worms in a quadrat is measured without error, the data generating mechanism D = m(x gr , ν, T gr ) is conditionally deterministic. For expositional clarity we use the point mass density, δ m(xgr,ν,Tgr) , to highlight our use of a conditionally deterministic data generat-ing mechanism.The resulting hierarchical model, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">1b</ref>, is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Y gr | x gr , ν ∼ δ m(xgr,ν,Tgr) , x gr | k gr , ν ∼ Uniform H(ν, T gr ) , k gr | λ g , ν ∼ Poisson λ g × Area of H(ν, T gr ) , Z | ν ∼ Normal(ν, σ 2 ),</formula><p>ν ∼ Normal(10, 10 2 ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">λ g ∼ Exponential(1), σ 2 ∝ 1/σ 2 .

Therefore, we can obtain p(Y gr | x gr , ν) in closed form using a geometric and combinatorial argument, and subsequently compute the likelihood p(Y gr | λ, ν) through integration over these distinct regions, as shown in the Supplementary Materials. In practice, such lengthy likelihood calculations are not feasible for general practitioners and their complexity introduces the potential for errors in implementation. However, forward simulation is often fast and computationally accessible for practitioners. As the difficulties with exact implementation increase with all but the simplest models, we illustrate transdimensional ABC as a practical alternative for this problem.</p><p>Our inference about introduction and spread is based on the marginal ABC posterior density: We use the transdimensional ABC sampler described in Algorithm 3, which is a variant of Algorithm 2, implemented with a birth-death proposal for the number of introductions for each road. A birth-death proposal consists of either increasing by one (birth), decreasing by one (death), or maintaining unchanged the number of introduction events with some probability. This sampling algorithm mimics the data-generating process to produce synthetic data efficiently, which leads to the fast mixing desired in an ABC algorithm. The birth-death proposal is a special case of the general transdimensional proposal with Jacobian of the transformation given by |J| = 1, because φ ij is taken to be the identity function of the auxiliary variables, which are sampled uniformly on H gr .</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">π ABC λ 1 , . . . , λ 8 , ν, σ 2 | Y 1,1 , . . .

However, uniform sampling from p(x gr | k gr , ν) over H(ν, T gr ) given k gr ≥ 1 introductions, generates presence in all quadrats with high probability. This is in contrast to the sets of split consecutive presence measurements separated by absences which were observed in the field data. Whereas conditioning on multiple consecutive presence measurements in the field data leads to high estimated introduction rates and marginal posterior densities of introduction events such as that illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>, a systematic lack of such multiple consecutive presence measurements in the simulated data leads to an underestimate of the number and rate of introductions. From this we conclude that for groups 6 and 7, the model assumption that introductions occur according to a homogeneous space-time Poisson process may not be reasonable. A more likely scenario for these two groups might consist of increased frequency of introductions in recent years leading to multiple consecutive separated strings of presences. Another possible culprit may be the assumption of a constant spread rate, which in reality may be hindered by obstacles to spread along roads. These possibilities present interesting subjects for further exploration and study of introduction and spread patterns for these individual regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and Prediction</head><p>The highest estimated introduction rates were for groups 6 and 7, which are located in the southwestern part of Alberta's boreal forest, near the Peace River Region. In this area, human settlement and agricultural conversion occurred earlier and more extensively than in the rest of northern Alberta (Schneider 2002). The higher earthworm introduction rates may thus be related to the greater intensity and longer history of human activity. However, it is not clear why groups 2 and 4 had substantially lower introduction rates than other loca-tions, as levels of anthropogenic disturbance are relatively similar to levels for groups 1, 3, 5, and 8. More intensive sampling at sites along a gradient of human activity would be needed to examine effects of anthropogenic disturbances on spatial variability of earthworm introduction rates. In all cases, the introduction rates estimated using our approach were lower than previously estimated from the same dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> yielded an estimated introduction rate of 1.03×10 -3 introductions/(m×yr), under the assumption of no active dispersal between sampling sites and a spread rate of 10 m/yr as obtained from literature from other regions. Attributing all occurrences to passive dispersal is likely to have produced an over-estimate of the introduction rate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate how the introduction and spread rate estimates produced by this analysis can be used to model invasive species distributions, we modelled earthworm distribution within the Alberta Pacific Forest Industries Forest Management Area (Al-Pac FMA), a 59 054 km 2 area in north-eastern Alberta.</p><p>We obtained road network and Alberta Vegetation Inventory (AVI) data from Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries and additional data on road ages from the Mistakiis Institute. In ArcGIS 10.1, we generated points every 10 m along the road network, randomly invaded these points using the introduction rate from our analysis, and created buffers around invaded points using the spread rate, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. We produced a map of the predicted areal extent of earthworms for 2006 (the year for which we were able to obtain road age data), which was intersected with a GIS layer containing forest habitat suitable for invasion. All forest types were considered to be suitable except stands in which black spruce Picea mariana or tamarack Larix laricina were dominant, as such forests have highly acidic soils and are thus less likely to be colonized by earthworms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Because we did not have a large number of sites sampled representatively across the Al-Pac FMA, we created the maps in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>   and 10 m/yr, as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>2006, while the middle values were used to illustrate predictions of the extent after 50 years following data collection. Since the Al-Pac FMA is located between groups 1-4, a low value of (λ, ν) was selected from the lower end of the bivariate posterior distributions for groups 2 and 4, while a high value of (λ, ν)</p><p>was selected from the higher end of the distributions for groups 1 and 3. The middle value was taken to be the median of the four group posteriors. All three points are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. FMA would be invaded by earthworms based on their higher estimated rate of introduction of 1.03×10 -3 introductions/(m×yr), and a fixed, non-estimated spread rate of 10 m/yr. However, our current approach to estimating the spread and introduction rates accounts for active dispersal and should produce more realistic estimates.</p><p>The increase in efficiency of the proposed transdimensional ABC algorithm over traditional fixed-dimensional formulations such as Metropolis-Hastings ABC is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A heat map of the approximate marginal density of introduction locations for one particular road is shown. Because the location vector changes dimension with the number of introductions, a fixed-dimensional ABC algorithm requires a forward-simulation step (rejection ABC) for the conditional simulation of this parameter. Instead, a transdimensional kernel allows us to make use of dependent proposals, thereby reducing Monte Carlo error when the areas of prior and posterior probabilities do not match. In this case, the prior on introduction locations is uniform over the event horizon, but the regions of high posterior density are concentrated in a very thin band around the edges of the horizon, rendering conditional simulation extremely inefficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Invasions frequently occur through a combination of long-distance jump dispersal events and diffusive spread around invaded sites, resulting in likelihoods that are often intractable. ABC methods provide an approximate inferential framework when the likelihood of the data cannot be evaluated. This paper develops a new efficient ABC sampler for a large class of models with infeasible or fully intractable likelihoods containing variable-dimensional integrals over a set of latent variables.</p><p>This class of models is used in a variety of applications. Spatio-temporal dynamic systems often combine stochastic generating mechanisms with complex time-evolution models, so that evaluation of the likelihood requires integration over a variable number of latent point sources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>). Kingman's coalescent models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in genetics are another example where observed data is generated via a process that depends on the number and location of latent branching points defining a genealogical tree. Likelihoods of the genetic data are typically unavailable and consist of an integral over the space of all branches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>).</p><p>Latent variable models with intractable likelihoods pose a challenge to existing ABC-MCMC samplers defined on fixed-dimensional probability spaces. In contrast, we were able to quickly obtain 250 000 MCMC samples per group of roads under each of the conditional values of ν using the more efficient transdimensional ABC algorithm proposed in this paper, even when requiring exact matches between summaries ( = 0).</p><p>The main structural limitation of our methodology is that the resulting inference is approximate, controlled by the degree of sufficiency of our selected summary statistics and the chosen error tolerance. However, this limitation is inherent in the problem of inferring parameters under intractable likelihoods.</p><p>All simulation-based methods suffer from the problem of dimensionality, precluding exact likelihood-free inference. Compared to established ABC methods, the sampling efficiency from our methodology allows strict error tolerances to be imposed, thereby improving the approximation. The transdimensional ABC approach proposed in this paper can be applied to problems where the likelihood consists of intractable variable-dimension integrals. on B centered at a.

Bivariate posterior density heat maps for the introduction and spread rates, ν and λ g , are shown in Figure4. The marginal posterior densities of λ g , g = 1, . . . , 8 can be classified into three categories as shown in the top panel of Figure5. Groups 4 and 2 have the lowest posterior median rates of introduction (1.31 × 10 -5 and 2.69 × 10 -5 introductions/(m×yr) respectively). Groups 1, 3, 5, and 8 have posterior median introduction rates in the mid-range (4.03 × 10 -5 , 4.12 × 10 -5 , 3.50 × 10 -5 , and 4.09 × 10 -5 introductions/(m×yr) respectively). Finally, groups 6 and 7 have the highest posterior median introduction rates (6.53×10 -5 , 7.38×10 -5 introductions/(m×yr) respectively). The marginal posterior of ν is shown in the middle panel of Figure5, where the posterior median was estimated at 13.93 m/yr with a 95% credible interval between 10.60 and 16.99 m/yr.
