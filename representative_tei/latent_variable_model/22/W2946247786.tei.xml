<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Popular thoughts and folk wisdom have accentuated the prominence of a positive orientation to life. In parallel, scholars have devoted a great deal of research attention to optimism, "a mood or attitude associated with an expectation about the social or material future-one which the evaluator regards as socially desirable, to his [or her] advantage, or for his <ref type="bibr">[or her]</ref> pleasure" <ref type="bibr">(Tiger, 1979, p. 18)</ref>. The burgeoning literature has demonstrated the benefits of optimism in predicting employee job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Munyon, Hochwarter, Perrewé, &amp; Ferris, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seligman &amp; Schulman, 1986)</ref>, leadership potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chemers, Watson, &amp; May, 2000)</ref>, well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aryee, Srinivas, &amp; Tan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Gould, Dieffenbach, &amp; Moffett, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Lee, Ashford, &amp; Jamieson, 1993)</ref>, and even winners of Olympic games <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Gould et al., 2002)</ref> and presidential candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Zullow &amp; Seligman, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>The majority of the literature on optimism has adopted an individual difference approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Forgeard &amp; Seligman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peterson, 2000)</ref>. Thus in this study, we focus on dispositional optimism, "an individual difference variable that reflects the extent to which people hold generalized favorable expectancies for their future" <ref type="bibr">(Carver, Scheier, &amp; Segerstrom, 2010, p. 879)</ref>. Previous research has mainly examined the selection effect of dispositional optimism on predicting employee career success and social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Forgeard &amp; Seligman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peterson, 2000)</ref>. Selection effects are broadly defined as the influences of individual characteristics on shaping the situations that individuals engage in (e.g., through career choice or job crafting) <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Schneider, 1983)</ref>. Recently, scholars have started to investigate the other direction of causality: The socialization effect of life experiences on the development of dispositional optimism. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Segerstrom (2007)</ref> reported that the size of social network and number of subordinates one supervised were significantly related to the change of dispositional optimism in a two wave longitudinal study.</p><p>The selection effect of dispositional optimism on modifying work outcomes and the socialization effect of work experiences on optimism development represent two contrasting views on the direction of causality in the relationship between dispositional optimism and work variables. Selection effects have been featured prominently in research adopting the classic dispositional perspective of personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(McCrae et al., 2000)</ref>, such as the majority of organizational research <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Tasselli, Kilduff, &amp; Landis, 2018)</ref>. It assumes that personality traits cause work outcomes, and negates the socialization effect, because personality traits are "endogenous dispositions that follow intrinsic paths of development essentially independent of environmental influences" <ref type="bibr">(McCrae et al., 2000, p. 173</ref>). Hence, most organizational "researchers have tended to render such [personality] change impossible by definition" <ref type="bibr">(Tasselli et al., 2018, p. 44)</ref>. Likewise, dispositional optimism has been portrayed as "a relatively enduring characteristic that changes little with the vagaries of life" <ref type="bibr">(Scheier &amp; Carver, 1993, p. 27)</ref>.</p><p>Socialization effects are rooted in research adopting the radical contextualist perspective (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lewis, 2001)</ref>, which highlights influences of contextual factors and often neglects influences of personality traits. Thus, there is a need to reconcile the two contradictory perspectives.</p><p>Extrapolating from the TESSERA framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017</ref>) that recognizes the coexistence of the selection and the socialization effect, we propose that the relationship between employee dispositional optimism and work variables is reciprocal in nature:</p><p>Dispositional optimism likely changes one's work experiences, and the changed work experiences may in turn give rise to further changes in optimism later on. Such an integrated perspective potentially reconciles the two seemingly conflicting views. It highlights that the selection effect and the socialization effect likely coexist and further reinforce each other over time. Essentially, this taps into a core question pertaining to a self-reinforcing cycle for dispositional optimism, that is, whether the work experiences that can be altered by dispositional optimism tend to prompt dispositional optimism development at a later point in time.</p><p>Adopting a latent change score approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ferrer &amp; McArdle, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">McArdle, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">McArdle, , 2009) )</ref> with a five-wave longitudinal design, we examine change-related reciprocal relationships between dispositional optimism and work variables including income, job insecurity, coworker support, and supervisor support. Prior research has documented that pursuits of major life goals driven by dispositional optimism are likely to be reflected in two major arenas: Work achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Segerstrom, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seligman &amp; Schulman, 1986)</ref>, and social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Assad, Donnellan, &amp; Conger, 2007)</ref>. Accordingly, we operationalize work experiences by drawing on the socioanalytic theory of personality and job performance (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hogan &amp; Holland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">R. Hogan, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">R. Hogan &amp; Blickle, in press</ref>). It postulates that people are motivated by two basic needs: Getting ahead and getting along. "Getting along was defined as behavior that gains the approval of others, enhances cooperation, and serves to build and maintain relationships. Getting ahead was defined as behavior that produces results and advances an individual within the group and the group within its competition." (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hogan &amp; Holland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 103)</ref>. As such, we employ the career success variables, income, and job insecurity to indicate getting ahead and social support from coworker and supervisor for getting along. Income has been widely adopted as an objective indicator of career success <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baruch &amp; Bozionelos, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, &amp; Barrick, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Ng, Eby, Sorensen, &amp; Feldman, 2005)</ref>. Job insecurity is defined as "perceived powerlessness to maintain desired continuity in a threatened job situation" <ref type="bibr">(Greenhalgh &amp; Rosenblatt, 1984, p. 438)</ref>. As today's organizations are facing numerous threats, changes, and challenges, employees are becoming increasingly vulnerable to job loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Lee, Huang, &amp; Ashford, 2018)</ref>. Being able to maintain the stability and continuity of one's job (i.e., low job insecurity) becomes essential to employee career advancement and success <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Shoss, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Coworker support and supervisor support refer to the amount of assistance that one receives from coworker and supervisor respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990)</ref>. They have been studied as crucial forms of social relationships at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chiaburu &amp; Harrison, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Humphrey, Nahrgang, &amp; Morgeson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Tews, Michel, &amp; Ellingson, 2013)</ref>. This investigation contributes to the scholarship on optimism in three ways. First, examining change-related reciprocal relationships between dispositional optimism and work experiences represents a first step to integrate the two seemingly conflicting perspectives on the causal direction embedded in these linkages: Selection effect of dispositional optimism and socialization effect of work experiences. In his review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peterson (2000)</ref> lamented that "little attention has been paid to the origins of this individual difference and in particular to the distinct possibility that its putative outcomes are … its determinants" (p. 47). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fisher and Aguinis (2017)</ref> pointed out that knowledge on such change-related reciprocal relationships enables scholars to "improve the explanatory and predictive adequacy" of the theory on optimism (p. 449).</p><p>Second, this study sheds light on what and how work experiences change dispositional optimism and contributes to the new endeavors to "better understand how optimism is formed" <ref type="bibr">(Forgeard &amp; Seligman, 2012, p. 115)</ref>. In doing so, this study challenges, and complements, the view that dispositional optimism changes little over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Scheier &amp; Carver, 1993)</ref> and promotes a developmental mindset <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012)</ref>. Examining lagged effects of work experiences on optimism development also represents a more stringent test of the socialization effect. Most recent research merely correlated change of optimism with concurrent change of life experiences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chopik, Kim, &amp; Smith, 2015)</ref>. Correlating two change variables captured at the same time does not permit strong inferences for causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cook &amp; Campbell, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>Third, this study serves as a more rigorous examination of the dispositional perspective of dispositional optimism by probing its effect on changing work variables with a longitudinal design <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Segerstrom, 2007)</ref>. Put differently, we use dispositional optimism at Time n to predict changes in work variables from Time n to Time n+1. The majority of prior research has adopted cross-sectional or lagged designs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aryee et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chemers et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Gould et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Lee et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Munyon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seligman &amp; Schulman, 1986)</ref>, which limits the examination of the causal effect of dispositional optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cook &amp; Campbell, 1979)</ref>.</p></div>

Such patterns are stable enough to represent dispositions, but also able to change throughout adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bleidorn, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Caspi, Roberts, &amp; Shiner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Roberts &amp; Mroczek, 2008)</ref>.

A major reason for personality change is that different people have distinct life experiences, which lead to various forms of personality change <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Roberts &amp; Mroczek, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>As such, individual differences in personality change are at the forefront of research on personality development <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bleidorn, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Specht et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Among the new theoretical developments <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Fleeson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fleeson &amp; Jayawickreme, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Roberts &amp; Jackson, 2008)</ref>, the TESSERA framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref> outlines the selection effect of personality traits by explaining that "individuals select or create personalitycongruent situations" (p. 258) and the socialization effect by explaining how life experiences alter personality traits in the long-term "due to repeated short-term situational processes" (p. 253). In tandem, the framework suggests that personality traits change one's life experiences, and the altered life experiences in turn bring further changes in those personality traits.</p><p>In particular, in accounting for long-term personality development, the TESSERA framework stipulates that triggering situations first influence expectancies about which states (e.g., behaviors, thoughts, or feelings) are appropriate. State/States expression follows, which then results in reactions from oneself or other people. The ensuing two processes serve as the major mechanisms for personality change: reflection and learning from the reactions and consequences, because they influence whether behaviors, thoughts, or feelings will be repeated, generalized, and habituated in the future. Such repeated processes will change the patters of behaviors, thoughts, or feelings, that is, by definition, personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Johnson, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Applied to the current research, we expect the selection effect of dispositional optimism to play out in two work arenas related to getting ahead and getting along. Chiefly, optimistic individuals seek or create more challenging work tasks and exhibit greater persistence over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2014)</ref>. Hence, they tend to enjoy higher income and lower job insecurity.</p><p>They also tend to experience increased coworker and supervisor support over time, because they exhibit greater levels of positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chang &amp; Sanna, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaplan, Bradley, Luchman, &amp; Haynes, 2009)</ref>, and are liked more by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carver, Kus, &amp; Scheier, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The socialization effect of work experiences on development of optimism occurs when optimists successfully achieve their work goals of getting ahead and getting along. Achieving such goals provides ample opportunities to enhance optimistic individuals' confidence and growth. The positive reactions from others and themselves trigger reflection and learning, which in turn reinforce the tendency to form more favorable expectations in the future. As a result, optimists' behavioral tendencies likely get generalized and habituated. Increases in dispositional optimism ensue. In concert, a recursive cycle likely emerges: Optimistic employees are likely to become more successful in achieving important work goals of getting ahead and getting along; increased achievements in obtaining those goals may further strengthen dispositional optimism.</p><p>In what follows, we first formulate hypotheses on the selection effect of dispositional optimism on changing work experiences. Then we delineate the rationale for the socialization effect of work experiences on changing dispositional optimism. Last, we present hypotheses on change-related reciprocal relationships between dispositional optimism and work experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection Effect of Dispositional Optimism on Changes of Work Experiences</head><p>Dispositional optimism and changes of income and job insecurity. We expect optimistic employees to reap the benefits of obtaining greater levels of career goals of getting ahead (e.g., increases in income and decreases in job insecurity) for three reasons. First, optimistic employees tend to craft work environments that allow them to set up higher career goals and persevere more over time even in stressful situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Forgeard &amp; Seligman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peterson, 2000)</ref>. As they have achieved their goals, they tend to set more challenging goals in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Latham &amp; Locke, 2007)</ref>. Second, optimists are increasingly able to disengage from intractable and unobtainable goals, because disengagement from such goals liberates them to conserve resources and pursue more important and obtainable goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aspinwall, Richter, &amp; Hoffman, 2001)</ref>. Third, optimistic employees are able to attract more organizational sponsorship over time. Because optimists achieve higher levels of job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Seligman &amp; Schulman, 1986)</ref> and are perceived as more leader-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chemers et al., 2000)</ref>, they likely secure greater sponsorship from organizations over time.</p><p>Organizational sponsorship has been shown to be a critical catalyst to facilitate career success <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Ng et al., 2005)</ref>. All the above reasoning suggests that optimistic employees likely achieve greater success in terms of getting ahead, which may be reflected in earning higher income and having lower job insecurity over time.</p><p>Previous research provides indirect support for this prediction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seligman and Schulman (1986)</ref> found that optimistic sales agents outperformed their less optimistic counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Segerstrom (2007)</ref> reported that dispositional optimism was positively related to income 10 years later. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cheng, Mauno, and Lee (2014)</ref> found a negative relationship between dispositional optimism and job insecurity. We thus propose that:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Employee dispositional optimism is positively related to increases in income (H1a) and decreases in job insecurity (H1b) over time.</p><p>Dispositional optimism and increases in social support at work. We also predict positive relationships of dispositional optimism with increases in important work goals related to getting along: coworkers and supervisors support. Optimistic employees likely reach out to seek more support from coworker and supervisor over time to aid achieving more challenging work goals or dealing with stress. Social support from coworker and supervisor represents two important forms of resources at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Eisenberger, Stinglhamber, Vandenberghe, Sucharski, &amp; Rhoades, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Humphrey et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990)</ref>. They are manifested in instrumental support including providing crucial information and resource to complete work tasks and emotional support providing assistance in dealing with stressors. As optimistic employees seek more and more challenging work goals, the importance of coworker and supervisor support tends to increasingly loom large. Furthermore, when facing relationship challenges with significant others, optimists tend to engage in more cooperative problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Assad et al., 2007)</ref> and thus have long-term and successful relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Segerstrom, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Last, optimistic employees are likely to attract more and more support from coworkers and supervisors over time. They often exhibit greater levels of positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chang &amp; Sanna, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Tennen, Affleck, Urrows, Higgins, &amp; Mendola, 1992)</ref> and confidence with their abilities in achieving work goals. Interacting with such upbeat and confident employees tends to be perceived as rewarding to coworkers and supervisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Harker &amp; Keltner, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although there is lack of evidence in direct support for this prediction, research showed that dispositional optimism predicted increases in emotional support from friends and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brissette, Scheier, &amp; Carver, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dougall, Hyman, Hayward, McFeeley, &amp; Baum, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Dispositional optimism was also reported to be positively related to increases in romantic relationship satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Assad et al., 2007)</ref>. We thus hypothesize the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Employee dispositional optimism is positively related to increases in coworker support (H2a) and supervisor support (H2b) over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socialization Effect of Work Experiences on Development of Dispositional Optimism</head><p>Income, job insecurity, and changes of dispositional optimism. We expect that having achieved important work goals related to getting ahead and getting along will further spur increases in dispositional optimism over time through employees' reflecting upon and learning from successful work experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref>. First, getting ahead successfully, as reflected in earning high income <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baruch &amp; Bozionelos, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Judge et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Ng et al., 2005)</ref> and experiencing low job insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Greenhalgh &amp; Rosenblatt, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Shoss, 2017)</ref>, may strengthen one's confidence in his or her abilities to pursue more challenging work goals in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Latham &amp; Locke, 2007)</ref>. Achieving such a success also breeds more positive affect, which, in turn, broadens employees' thought-action repertoires and builds up more enduring intellectual and physical resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Fredrickson, 2001)</ref>. The gratifying work experience tends to become easily remembered and readily accessible, which is conducive to reflection.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiences</head><p>Integrating the selection effect of dispositional optimism on changing work experiences (Hypotheses 1 to 2) and the socialization effect of work experiences on changing dispositional optimism (Hypotheses 3 to 4), we expect a change-related reciprocal relationship: Dispositional optimism will alter work variables, and the changed work variables in turn will prompt further increases in dispositional optimism later on. The TESSERA framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref> proposes that a personality trait tends to be strengthened by life experiences through "seeking or creating environments that reinforce the original personality trait" (p. 261; also see the corresponsive principle, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006)</ref>. Stated differently, work experiences tend to strengthen the personality traits that lead individuals to those work experiences in the first place.</p><p>In the case of this study, the TESSERA framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref> suggests that optimistic employees shape work environments that are conducive to getting ahead and getting along, because they set up, and are able to achieve, more challenging work tasks throughout their careers. They are also capable of forging more supportive social relationships at work. Such a selection effect renders it likely for optimistic employees to enjoy higher income, lower job insecurity, and more coworker and supervisor support over time. Furthermore, having successfully achieved important life goals of getting ahead and getting along provides the positive reinforcement to validate the approaches that optimistic employees adopt. According to the TESSERA framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref>, the gratifying affective reactions from others and oneself render such successful experiences more likely to be reflected upon. At the same time, successfully getting ahead and getting along provide the opportunities and resources for optimistic employees' skill development through a learning mechanism. The two processes of reflection and learning enable optimistic employees to develop more generalized and favorable expectations in all life domains for the future. Over time, dispositional optimism will increase. Note that proposing a change-related reciprocal relationship does not mean that the two effects are equal in strength. It provides an account for the notion that dispositional optimism is both relatively stable, and open to change.</p><p>Examining reciprocal relationships in organizational research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interplays between the person and the environment rooted in interactional psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Schneider, 1983</ref>).

Among the few studies, sociologists <ref type="bibr">Kohn and</ref><ref type="bibr">Schooler (1978, 1982)</ref> examined reciprocal relationships of work experiences with personality and intellectual flexibility. Personality psychologists (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Roberts et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Sutin &amp; Costa, 2010)</ref> and organizational scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Frese, Garst, &amp; Fay, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wu &amp; Griffin, 2012)</ref> have also started to look into such issues. We thus propose that:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: There are change-related reciprocal relationships between dispositional optimism with work variables over time, such that dispositional optimism is positively related to increases in income, coworkers support, and supervisor support, and negatively related to decreases in job insecurity; the changed work variables further strengthen dispositional optimism later on.</p></div>

The major purpose of this project was to examine how changes in working condition during the transition period Researchers identified participants of the large longitudinal study in the following manner. First, researchers randomly selected streets in Dresden, a large city in the south of East Germany. Then they chose every third house in each selected street, and invited individuals from every fourth apartment in each house. In smaller houses, individuals in every third apartment were invited. Last, researchers invited full-time employees in the selected apartments from ages of 18 to 65 to participate. Across the five waves of data used for the current research<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , the same 665 working employees were invited for each wave. <ref type="bibr">Among them,</ref><ref type="bibr">530,</ref><ref type="bibr">536,</ref><ref type="bibr">497,</ref><ref type="bibr">474,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 486</ref> provided usable information on study variables for the five waves respectively, yielding response rates of 79.7%, 80.6%, 74.7%, 71.2%, and 73.1%. To prevent participant attrition, after each data collection the researchers sent participants reports with key findings. Furthermore, about two months prior to each data collection, participants received a letter announcing the upcoming visit of a researcher. The procedures led to a representative sample in terms of age, gender, and social class of working population in the city.</p><p>Researchers collected the five waves of data during the following time periods: October to December, 1990, August to September, 1991, August to September, 1992, August to September, 1993, and August to September, 1995. A major consideration for choosing such time lags was that over time, the situation in East Germany became more stable and thus the influences of reunification gradually decayed. In our analyses, we included participants with all available information on study variables. Detailed information is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The practice of using all possible data available has been suggested previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Newman, 2009)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Dispositional optimism. We assessed dispositional optimism with the widely adopted eight-item measure of the Life Orientation Test (LOT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985)</ref> on a response scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree).

As such, LOT has been the most widely adopted measure to assess dispositional optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Forgeard &amp; Seligman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peterson, 2000)</ref>. This measure includes four positively and four negative worded items. Sample items were "In uncertain times, I usually expect the best" and "If something can go wrong for me, it will" (negatively worded). Internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's α) were .72, .74, .73, .72, and .73 respectively for the five waves.</p><p>Income. We captured respondents' monthly income with one item asking them to indicate the level of income from the following options in Deutsche Mark (In the years of data collection 1 Deutsche Mark was approximately 0.65 U.S. dollar): 1) less than 600, 2) 600-800, 3) 800-1000, 4) 1000-1200, 5) 1200-1400, 6) 1400-1600, 7) 1600-1800, 8) 1800-2000, and 9) more than 2000. Following previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Westerhof &amp; Barrett, 2005)</ref>, we utilized the middle value of the range indicated by each option (e.g., 700 to indicate option 2) 600-800; 300 was used for option 1) and 2000 was used for option 9)) and employed the natural logarithm transformation of the values in the analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Judge, Cable, Boudreau, &amp; Bretz, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Job insecurity. We gauged participants' job insecurity with a three-item scale by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Frese and Hilligloh (1991)</ref>, which has also been used previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Garst et al., 2000)</ref> (α = .50, .55, .52, .49 and .49, respectively for the five waves). Participants reported the extent to which they agreed or disagreed to questions regarding their job insecurity on a five-point scale (1=Not true at all, 5=Completely true). A sample item is "If you become unemployed, how good are your chances of actually finding a job?" Similar unidimensional measures of job insecurity have been adopted in previous research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Oldham, Kulik, Stepina, &amp; Ambrose, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Social support from coworker and supervisor. We measured coworker and supervisor support using scales adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Caplan, Cobb, French, van Harrison, and Pinneau (1975)</ref>. The two scales have been employed previously and demonstrated sufficient reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Frese, 1999)</ref>. Participants rated on a four-point scale (1=Not at all, 4=Absolutely) three questions with reference to supervisor and colleagues, respectively: "How much is … willing to listen to your work-related problems?", "How much is … helpful for you to get your job done?", Optimism, Work Experiences, &amp; Reciprocal Relationship 19 and "How much can … be relied on when things get tough at work?". The two scales have appreciable reliabilities for all the five waves (for supervisory support, α = .86, .88, .87, .86 and .85 respectively; for coworker support, α = .84, .83, .82, .83 and .81).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Strategy</head><p>We adopted the classic latent change score approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ferrer &amp; McArdle, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">McArdle, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">McArdle, , 2009) )</ref> to test our hypotheses. This approach explicitly models change as a latent variable that can be derived from a construct of interest measured at two adjacent time points. Thus, it is more flexible than latent growth curve modeling that typically requires at least three waves of data to model a change variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bliese &amp; Ployhart, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Liu, Mo, Song, &amp; Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Preacher, Briggs, Wichman, &amp; MacCallum, 2008)</ref>. Because of its advantage in explicitly modeling change in a flexible and straightforward manner, this approach has been recently applied to examine change related issues not only in personality psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Jackson, Hill, Payne, Roberts, &amp; Stine-Morrow, 2012)</ref>, but also in organizational research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ritter, Matthews, Ford, &amp; Henderson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">S. G. Taylor, Bedeian, Cole, &amp; Zhang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Toker &amp; Biron, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wu, Griffin, &amp; Parker, 2015)</ref>. Another unique advantage of this approach is that it allows scholars to examine reciprocal relationships directly related to change that do not restrict the form of change to be linear. This is because a change variable can be modeled by a variable at two time points and thus change from Time n to Time n+1 does not have to bear a linear relationship with change from Time n+1 to Time n+2. It has advantages over latent growth curve modeling and cross-lagged analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(McArdle, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(McArdle, , 2009))</ref>. Latent growth curve modeling typically models change as the slope or high-order terms across at least three time points and it is typically not used to examining reciprocal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bliese &amp; Ployhart, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Liu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Preacher et al., 2008)</ref>. Cross-lagged analyses, although often used to test reciprocal relationships, are not adopted in directly modeling changes in an explicit way. The latent change score approach is regarded as a more generalized and flexible approach incorporating the advantages of both latent growth curve modeling and cross-lagged analyses.</p><p>As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>, following previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ferrer &amp; McArdle, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">McArdle, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">McArdle, , 2009))</ref>, the classic bivariate latent change score model was utilized to examine a changerelated reciprocal relationship between a work variable and dispositional optimism. A latent change variable (e.g., change of dispositional optimism from Time 1 to Time 2, Δ DO1) is modeled as the change of the same construct between Time 1 and Time 2 (in total, four latent change variables across the five time points were modeled). In addition, this model encompasses two change parameters that are often examined in latent growth curve modeling: An intercept and a slope, for each of the two constructs. The intercept (e.g., InterceptDO for dispositional optimism) affects the starting point of a variable at Time 1 (e.g., DO1) and the slope (e.g., SlopeDO for dispositional optimism) affects all the latent change variables (e.g., Δ DO1 to Δ DO4). The selection effect of dispositional optimism was examined through the influence of optimism on the change in a work variable (γ1) and the socialization effect was tested via the influence of a work variable on the change in dispositional optimism (γ2). If the two effects are both significant, then a change-related reciprocal relationship is supported. Following previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lang, Bliese, Lang, &amp; Adler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Meier &amp; Spector, 2013)</ref>, we used the following indices to evaluate model fitness: Comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) for the latent change score models. Standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) was also used in confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). We performed the analyses using Mplus 8.0 <ref type="bibr">(Muthen &amp; Muthen, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">-2017)</ref>.</p></div>

Thus, we first conducted CFAs to demonstrate the study variables were independent from each other at each time point. Error terms of the negatively worded items for dispositional optimism were allowed to correlated with each other; the same for the parallel items of supervisor support and coworker support (which only differed in the reference, i.e., "supervisor" or "coworker"). Results showed that a fourfactor model (with dispositional optimism, job insecurity, coworker support, and supervisor support) generated appreciable model fit indices for all the five waves of data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Thus, the measures used at each wave were independent from each other.</p><p>We then examined two types of measurement invariance, configural (i.e., form) and metric (i.e., factor loading) equivalence <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000)</ref> across time.

The correlations of dispositional optimism across the five measurement occasions ranged from .53 to .75, indicating relative consistency across time. The correlations of the work variables across time fell within the range from .18 to .68, which seems to suggest less consistency. The mean levels of dispositional optimism for the whole sample did not change significantly across the five waves. Participants' mean level of income increased over time across time from wave 1 to wave 5. While participants did not experience significant change in supervisor support, they experienced significant increment in coworker support from wave 3 to wave 4. We suspect that the significant changes in mean levels of those variables might be related to the fact that after unification, there was a high necessity for former East German companies to invest in new technology, adopt contemporary management styles, and cope with the competition. Those changes might start to be manifested in in numerous improvements in working conditions from wave 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Frese et al., 1996)</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).

Likewise, dispositional optimism has been portrayed as a personality trait that changes little with life experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Scheier &amp; Carver, 1993)</ref>. As such, the observed significant relationships between dispositional optimism and work outcomes have typically been interpreted as suggesting the causal effect of dispositional optimism on work outcomes, not vice versa. Yet, our findings show the necessity to examine this assumption more rigorously by looking at whether dispositional optimism prompts changes in work variables longitudinally.</p><p>Such an approach allows us to strike one step closer to examining the causal influences of dispositional optimism. From a temporal perspective, investigating the influence of dispositional optimism on changing work variables over time represents a theoretically distinct approach than examining their concurrent correlations in terms of time specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Mitchell &amp; James, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimism, Work Experiences, &amp; Reciprocal Relationship 25</head><p>This partly explains the different findings between this research and previous cross-sectional research on dispositional optimism and career success. In fact, this is also the case for other personality traits. As one example, previous cross-sectional research found a significant relationship between proactive personality and income <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Seibert, Crant, &amp; Krainer, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>However, longitudinal research <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Seibert, Kraimer, &amp; Crant, 2001)</ref> reported that "proactive personality was not significantly correlated with salary progression or promotions" (p. 863).</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Sutin et al. (2009)</ref> found that while a significant concurrent relationship between neuroticism and income was recorded, when examined longitudinally, neuroticism did not lead to changes in income over time. However, income significantly decreased neuroticism. Our findings are in fact in keeping with those from recent longitudinal research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Segerstrom (2007)</ref> found that dispositional optimism did not predict increases in social network size, satisfaction with social support, nor number of supportive others. Future research should use longitudinal designs including experience sampling methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2015)</ref> to reveal developmental patterns of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings of optimistic people.</p><p>The findings of the current research have implications for intervention research on changing optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2014)</ref>. The assumption that dispositional optimism is beneficial serves as the very theoretical foundation for recent research looking into interventions that are able to promote optimism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Gillham, Reivich, Jaycox, &amp; Seligman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Seligman, 2006)</ref>. Otherwise, there will be no reason to change optimism. If dispositional optimism has little substantial effect on changing life outcomes, it will cast doubt on the approach of changing optimism as an avenue to promote performance and well-being. Our findings suggest that before conducing intervention research, perhaps it is informative for researcher to consolidate evidence to show that optimism indeed gives rise to changes in certain work variables of interest.</p><p>The current study investigated what and how work variables contribute to the development of dispositional optimism over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Forgeard &amp; Seligman, 2012)</ref>. While the influences of coworkers support and supervisor support were not significant, employees with high levels of income and low levels of job insecurity experienced increases in dispositional optimism later on. Such findings pose a challenge to the traditional dispositional perspective that assumes dispositional optimism changes little with life experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Scheier &amp; Carver, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The findings suggest that the work variables related to getting ahead are more important in driving changes in dispositional optimism than those related to getting along. Our reading of the literature on socioanalytic theory of personality and job performance (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hogan &amp; Holland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">R. Hogan, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">R. Hogan &amp; Blickle, in press)</ref> suggests that this literature has yet to distinguish the relative importance of the two important life goals of getting ahead and getting along. Thus, we speculate possible reasons for the differences. Variables related to getting ahead as we studied in this research reflect employees' capabilities to maintain their stability of employment and successfully advance their careers in an uncertain period <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baruch &amp; Bozionelos, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Greenhalgh &amp; Rosenblatt, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Judge et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Ng et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Shoss, 2017)</ref>. Achieving such goals has significance for survival and reproduction from an evolutionary perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bakan, 1966)</ref>. As such, obtaining goals related to getting ahead seems more salient to employee career development than those of getting along. It follows that high income and low job insecurity may be more likely to promote the two processes underlying personality development: reflection upon and learning from such successful experiences. Thus they are more likely to prompt changes in dispositional optimism. Future research can build on our findings and formally test such differences with longitudinal designs.</p><p>Perhaps the most important contribution of the current research lies in its investigation of change-related reciprocal relationships between dispositional optimism and work variables. Such an investigation recognizes that the causal direction in such relationships travels both ways and provides a potential reconciliation for the two contrasting perspectives discussed previously. Our findings revealed that such a reciprocal relationship occurred between dispositional optimism and job insecurity: Being an optimistic employee prompted decreases in job insecurity and the weakened job insecurity in turn strengthened one's optimistic disposition later on. This finding is consistent with previous research showing a reciprocal relationship between job insecurity and self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kinnunen et al., 2003)</ref>. Such reciprocal relationships have already been hinted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peterson (2000)</ref> and suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bandura ( , 2001))</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bell and Staw (1989)</ref> also argued that people are both sculptors and sculpture of their career development. Organizational research has demonstrated that such reciprocal relationships occurred between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Wu &amp; Griffin, 2012)</ref>, and between proactive personality and job demands and job control <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. Our study extended this line of research to the literature on dispositional optimism and provides a more nuanced understanding of the development of optimism.</p><p>The finding that job insecurity bore a change-related reciprocal relationship with dispositional optimism raises the question how long such a virtuous cycle endures. Scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sonnentag &amp; Frese, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Sturman, 2007)</ref> suggest when optimistic employees set up more challenging goals as a result of low job insecurity, their skills may not develop fast enough to meet the new requirements. Such a situation will not generate lower job insecurity later on. Put differently, an enduring virtuous cycle entails self-correction and selfregulation, which ultimately results in asymptotes. Future research needs to examine this challenging question related to the sustainability of self-reinforcing cycles in greater depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Study limitations. The results of this research should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, the unique changing economic and social environment in East Germany, though providing a suitable context to test the hypotheses, limits the generalization of the findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Shin, Morgeson, &amp; Campion, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">P. J. Taylor, Li, Shi, &amp; Borman, 2008</ref>). Yet, nowadays, many countries are experiencing political or economic changes in Latin America, <ref type="bibr">Europe, Africa, and Asia (United Nations Development Programme, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and job automation has been changing not only the nature of work, but also job requirements of the workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Frey &amp; Osborne, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Manyika et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus it seems premature to conclude that our findings have little implication for today's world. Future research needs to examine the reciprocal relationships in other economic and cultural settings. Second, the latent change score approach typically requires equal time intervals between adjacent measurement occasions. This ensures that the influences of study variables between adjacent occasions are equal. As in previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Toker &amp; Biron, 2012)</ref>, uneven time intervals were used in this research: The time intervals for the first four waves were approximately 1 year and the time interval was 2 years between the fourth and fifth wave. This concern may be alleviated, though, because the influences of reunification on people's work and life slowed down over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dormann &amp; Zapf, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fay &amp; Sonnentag, 2002)</ref>. Third, time lag is a thorny issue for longitudinal research <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dormann &amp; Griffin, 2015)</ref>. Although consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Caspi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Roberts et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wu &amp; Griffin, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wu et al., 2015)</ref>, the selection of time lag in this study might not be optimal. Choosing the optimal time lag entails both empirical evidence and theoretical considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dormann &amp; Griffin, 2015)</ref>. Fourth, because positively and negatively worded items were used in the measure of job insecurity, the internal reliability coefficients for this scale were relatively low <ref type="bibr">(Weijters, Baumgartner, &amp; Schillewaert, 2013</ref>). However, this may reduce the chance to find significant findings and thus our study represents a conservative test of relationships related to job insecurity. Additional analyses with data using items of the job insecurity scale provided similar results. Fifth, consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bleidorn, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Caspi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Roberts &amp; Mroczek, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Tasselli et al., 2018)</ref>, self-report questionnaires were used as the major way of data collection.</p><p>Thus common method bias might influence the findings. However, the latent change score approach adopted in this study and the findings of this research suggest that this is not a serious problem. With the latent change score approach, a change score is defined as "the part of the score of Y[2] that is not identical to Y[1]" <ref type="bibr">(McArdle, 2009, p. 583)</ref>. If a variable at Time 1 is affected by common method bias, the same variable at Time 2 will also be influenced to the same extent (there is no theoretical reason to expect otherwise). As such, the change variable between Time 1 and Time 2 should be free from common method bias. Given that our hypotheses focused on change-related relationships, it seems unlikely that common method bias led to spurious significant results. This is probably the reason why we did not observe significant effect of dispositional optimism on changes of social support, nor vice versa.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Roberts &amp; Nickel, 2017)</ref>. Organizational scholars need consider securing large research funds to launch large-scale longitudinal research in the future to tackle such issues in greater depth. Last, recent research suggests that state optimism is a component of psychological capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Luthans, Avey, Avolio, &amp; Peterson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007)</ref>. While it is unknow whether dispositional optimism and the other three constructs of psychological capital also represent a underlying dispositional construct, future research can examine change-related reciprocal relationships for the other three components of psychological capital to test whether this is true.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Findings of this study offer important implications for organizations and employees to enhance employee career development. Our findings that income and job insecurity changed one's disposition to be optimistic have important implications for employees to effectively manage their careers. The findings suggest that employees should be mindful of the fundamental influences of their work experiences on altering their personality traits. If they are interested in maintaining or enhancing their dispositional optimism, they need to strategically create or seek out work environments that provide them with more opportunities of getting ahead (e.g., high levels of income and low job insecurity). Although great levels of career success are pursued by most employees, the findings regarding their influences on changing dispositional optimism provide employees with a more crucial reason to do so. In addition, our finding that the effect of dispositional optimism on changing work variables received support only on job insecurity serves a sobering note for both organizations and employees to introduce positive psychology interventions to enhance individual optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Seligman, 2006)</ref>. Dispositional optimism did not have a significant impact on changing income, an objective indicator of career success. Thus, interventions aiming at enhancing optimism may more likely have an effect on changing subjective rather than objective work outcomes. The notion is echoed by the criticism from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hackman (2009)</ref> who stated that the effect of positive psychological interventions should be examined more rigorously beyond employee perceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>As an important indicator of positive thinking, dispositional optimism has garnered much attention from both scholars and lay people. Drawing from the TESSERA framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wrzus &amp; Roberts, 2017)</ref> and the dispositional optimism literature, the current study served as a first attempt to integrate the two seemingly contrasting perspectives in the literature on dispositional optimism: The selection effect of optimism and the socialization effect of life experiences on altering optimism. The findings provided support for the importance of getting ahead in enhancing dispositional optimism and a reciprocal relationship between dispositional optimism and job insecurity. Future research should examine personality development in longitudinal research as "one of the most vital outcomes of organizational experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Tasselli et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 44)</ref>. Future research also need to investigate change-related reciprocal relationships between other personality traits and work experiences in order to unravel more intriguing interplays between the agentic person and the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura, 2001)</ref>      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>affected employees' work and life in East Germany.

Hypothesis 5 dealt with change-related reciprocal relationships between optimism and work variables. Overall, such a reciprocal relationship was observed for job insecurity. Dispositional optimism over time decreased job insecurity and the decreased job insecurity in turn fostered further increases in dispositional optimism. Hypothesis 5 was partially supported.</figDesc></figure>

Future research should explore change-related reciprocal relationships with other work experiences such as challenging work experiences (DeRue &amp; Wellman, 2009), stressors, and leadership. For example, leader behaviors play a role because they influence both dispositional optimism and social support at work. Given the relationship between leadership behaviors and dispositional optimism also tends to be reciprocal, including one more variable will to a great extent complicate the bivariate relationship examined in this study. Future research should explore such trivariate relationships more thoroughly. In addition, future research should examine mechanisms for personality development, which has been understudied in personality psychology</figDesc></figure>
