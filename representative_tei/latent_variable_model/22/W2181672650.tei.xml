<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Phrase-based models directly trained on mix-of-domain corpora can be sub-optimal. In this paper we equip phrase-based models with a latent domain variable and present a novel method for adapting them to an in-domain task represented by a seed corpus. We derive an EM algorithm which alternates between inducing domain-focused phrase pair estimates, and weights for mix-domain sentence pairs reflecting their relevance for the in-domain task. By embedding our latent domain phrase model in a sentence-level model and training the two in tandem, we are able to adapt all core translation components together -phrase, lexical and reordering. We show experiments on weighing sentence pairs for relevance as well as adapting phrase-based models, showing significant performance improvement in both tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Mix vs. Latent Domain Models</head><p>Domain adaptation is usually perceived as utilizing a small seed in-domain corpus to adapt an existing system trained on an out-of-domain corpus.</p><p>Here we are interested in adapting an SMT system trained on a large mix-domain corpus C mix to an in-domain task represented by a seed parallel corpus C in . The mix-domain scenario is interesting because often a large corpus consists of sentence pairs representing diverse domains, e.g., news, politics, finance, sports, etc.</p><p>At the core of a standard state-of-the-art phrasebased system <ref type="bibr">(Och and Ney, 2004</ref>) is a phrase table { ẽ, f } extracted from the word-aligned training data together with estimates for P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ). Because the translations of words often vary across domains, it is likely that in a mix-domain corpus C mix the translation ambiguity will increase with the domain diversity. Furthermore, the statistics in C mix will reflect translation preferences averaged over the diverse domains. In this sense, phrase-based models trained on C mix can be considered domainconfused. This often leads to suboptimal performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gascó et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Irvine et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Recent adaptation techniques can be seen as mixture models, where two or more phrase tables, estimated from in-and mix-domain corpora, are combined together by interpolation, fill-up, or multiple-decoding paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Koehn and Schroeder, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bisazza et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sennrich, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Razmara et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sennrich et al., 2013)</ref>. Here we are interested in the specific question how to induce a phrase-based model from C mix for indomain translation? We view this as in-domain focused training on C mix , a complementary adaptation step which might precede any further combination with other models, e.g., in-, mix-or general-domain.</p><p>The main challenge is how to induce from C mix a phrase-based model for the in-domain task, given only C in as evidence? We present an approach whereby the contrast between in-domain prior distributions and "out-domain" distributions is exploited for softly inviting (or recruiting) C mix phrase pairs to either camp. To this end we in-troduce a latent domain variable D to signify in-(D 1 ) and out-domain (D 0 ) respectively. 1  With the introduction of the latent variables, we extend the translation tables in phrase-based models from generic P t (ẽ | f ) to domain-focused by conditioning them on D, i.e., P t (ẽ | f , D) and decomposing them as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P t (ẽ | f , D) = P t (ẽ | f )P(D | ẽ, f ) ẽ P t (ẽ | f )P(D | ẽ, f )</formula><p>.</p><p>(1)</p><p>Where P(D | ẽ, f ) is viewed as the latent phraserelevance models, i.e., the probability that a phrase pair is in-(D 1 ) or out-domain (D 0 ). In the end, our goal is to replace the domain-confused tables, P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ), with the in-domain focused ones,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P t (ẽ | f , D 1 ) and P t ( f | ẽ, D 1 ). 2 Note how P t (ẽ | f , D 1 ) and P t ( f | ẽ, D 1 ) contains P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ) as special case.</formula><p>Eq. 1 shows that the key to training the latent phrase-based translation models is to train the latent phrase-relevance models, P (D | ẽ, f ). Our approach is to embed P (D | ẽ, f ) in asymmetric sentence-level models P (D | e, f ) and train them on C mix . We devise an EM algorithm where at every iteration, in-or out-domain estimates provide full sentence pairs e, f with expectations {P (D | e, f ) | D ∈ {0, 1}}. Once these expectation are in C mix , we induce re-estimates for the latent phrase-relevance models, P (D | ẽ, f ). Metaphorically, during each EM iteration the current in-or out-domain phrase pairs compete on inviting C mix sentence pairs to be in-or outdomain, which bring in new (weights for) in-and out-domain phrases. Using the same algorithm we also show how to adapt all core translation components in tandem, including also lexical weights and lexicalized reordering models.</p><p>Next we detail our model, the EM-based invitation training algorithm and provide technical solutions to a range of difficulties. We report exper-1 Crucially, the lack of explicit out-domain data in Cmix is a major technical difficulty. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cuong and Sima'an, 2014)</ref> and in the sequel present a relatively efficient solution based on a kind of "burn-in" procedure.</p><p>2 It is common to use these domain-focused models as additional features besides the domain-confused features. However, here we are more interested in replacing the domain-confused features rather than complementing them. This distinguishes this work from other domain adaptation literature for MT.</p><p>iments showing good instance weighting performance as well as significantly improved phrasebased translation performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model and training by invitation</head><p>Eq. 1 shows that the key to training the latent phrase-based translation models is to train the latent phrase-relevance models, P (D | ẽ, f ). As mentioned, for training P (D | ẽ, f ) on parallel sentences in C mix we embed them in two asymmetric sentence-level models {P (D | e, f ) | D ∈ {0, 1}}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Domain relevance sentence models</head><p>Intuitively, sentence models for domain relevance P (D | e, f ) are somewhat related to data selection approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moore and Lewis, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Axelrod et al., 2011)</ref>. The dominant approach to data selection uses the contrast between perplexities of in-and mix-domain language models. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> In the translation context, however, often a source phrase has different senses/translations in different domains, which cannot be distinguished with monolingual language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cuong and Sima'an, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, our proposed latent sentencerelevance model includes two major latent components -monolingual domain-focused relevance models and domain-focused translation models derives as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (D | e, f) = P (e, f, D) D∈{D 1 ,D 0 } P (e, f, D) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P (e, f, D) can be decomposed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (f, e, D) = 1 2 P (D)P lm (e | D)P t (f | e, D) + P (D)P lm (f | D)P t (e | f, D) .</formula><p>(3)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Here</head><p>• P t (e|f, D) and similarly P t (f|e, D): the latent domain-focused translation models aim at capturing the faithfulness of translation with respect to different domains. We simplify this as "bag-of-possible-phrases" translation models:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P t (e|f, D) := ẽ, f ∈A(e,f) P t (ẽ| f , D) c(ẽ, f ) ,</formula><p>(4) where A(e, f) is the multiset of phrases in e, f and c(•) denotes their count. Sub-model P t (ẽ| f , D) is given by Eq. 1.</p><p>• P lm (e|D), P lm (f|D): the latent monolingual domain-focused relevance models aim at capturing the relevance of e and f for identifying domain D but here we consider them language models (LMs). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> As mentioned, the out-domain LMs differ from previous works, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Axelrod et al., 2011)</ref>, which employ mix-domain LMs. Here, we stress the difficulty in finding data to train out-domain LMs and present a solution based on identifying pseudo out-domain data.</p><p>• P (D): the domain priors aim at modeling the percentage of relevant data that the learning framework induces. It can be estimated via phrase-level parameters but here we prefer sentence-level parameters:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref>  It is obvious that there does not exist a closed-form solution for Equation 6 because of the existence of the log-term log . The EM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dempster et al., 1977)</ref> comes as an alternative solution to fit the model. It can be seen to maximize L via blockcoordinate ascent on a lower bound F(q, Θ) using an auxiliary distribution q(D | e, f)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F(q, Θ) = e,f D q(D | e, f) log P Θ D (D, e, f) q(D | e, f)<label>(7</label></formula><p>) where the inequality results, i.e., L ≥ F(q, Θ), derived from log being concave and Jensen's inequality. We rewrite the Free Energy F(q, Θ) (Neal and Hinton, 1999) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F = e,f D q(D | e, f) log P Θ D (D | e, f) q(D | e, f) + e,f D q(D | e, f) log P Θ (e, f) = e,f log P Θ (e, f)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>-</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">KL[q(D | e, f) || P Θ D (D | e, f)],</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">KL[• || •] is the KL-divergence.</formula><p>With the introduction of the KL-divergence, the alternating E and M steps for our EM algorithm are easily derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E-step : q t+1 (9) argmax q(D | e,f) F(q, Θ t ) = argmin q(D | e,f) KL[q(D|e, f) || P Θ t D (D|e, f)] = P Θ t D (D | e, f) M-step : Θ t+1 (10) argmax Θ F(q t+1 , Θ) = argmax Θ e,f D q(D | e, f) log P Θ D (D, e, f)</formula><p>The iterative procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> At the E-step, a guess for P (D | ẽ, f ) can be used to update P t ( f | ẽ, D) and P t (ẽ | f , D) (i.e., using Eq. 1) and consequently P t (f | e, D) and P t (e | f, D) (i.e., using Eq. 4). These resulting table estimates, together with the domain-focused LMs and the domain priors are served as expected counts to update P (D | e, f).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> At the M-step,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hinton, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Before EM training starts we must provide a "reasonable" initial guess for P (D | ẽ, f ). We must also train the out-domain LMs, which needs the construction of pseudo out-domain data. 9 One simple way to do that is inspired by burnin in sampling, under the guidance of an indomain data set, C in as prior. At the beginning, we train P t (ẽ | f , D 1 ) and P t ( f | ẽ, D 1 ) for all phrases learned from C in . We also train P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ) for all phrases learned from C mix . During burn-in we assume that the out-domain phrase-based models are the domainconfused phrase-based models, i.e., P t</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(ẽ | f , D 0 ) ≈ P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ, D 0 ) ≈ P t ( f | ẽ).</formula><p>We isolate all the LMs and the prior models from our model, and apply a single EM iteration to update P (D | e, f) based on those domain-focused models</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P t (ẽ | f , D) and P t ( f | ẽ, D).</formula><p>In the end, we use P (D | e, f) to fill in the values of hidden variable D in C mix , so it provides us with an initialization for P (D | ẽ, f ). Subsequently, we also rank sentence pairs in C mix with is important to scale the probabilities of the four LMs to make them comparable: we normalize the probability that a LM assigns to a sentence by the total probability this LM assigns to all sentences in C mix .</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P (D 1 | e, f)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Intrinsic evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the ability of our model to retrieve "hidden" in-domain data in a large mix-domain corpus, i.e., we hide some in-domain data in a large mix-domain corpus. We weigh sentence pairs under our model with P (D 1 | ẽ, f ) and P (D 1 | e, f) respectively. We report pseudoprecision/recall at the sentence-level using a range of cut-off criteria for selecting the top scoring instances in the mix-domain corpus. A good relevance model expects to score higher for the hidden in-domain data.</p><p>Baselines Two standard perplexity-based selection models in the literature have been implemented as the baselines: cross-entropy difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moore and Lewis, 2010)</ref> and bilingual cross-entropy difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Axelrod et al., 2011)</ref>, investigating their ability to retrieve the hiding data as well. Training them over the data to learn the sentences with their relevance, we then rank the sentences to select top of pairs to evaluate the pseudo-precision/recall at the sentence-level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We use a mix-domain corpus C g of 770K sentence pairs of different genres. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">10</ref> There is also a Legal corpus of 183K pairs that serves as the in-domain data. We create C mix by selecting an arbitrary 83K pairs of in-domain pairs and adding them to C g (the hidden in-domain data); we use the remaining 100k in-domain pairs as C in .</p><p>To train the baselines, we construct interpolated 4-gram Kneser-Ney LMs using BerkeleyLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pauls and Klein, 2011)</ref>. Training our model on the data takes six EM-iterations to converge.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref>  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> helps us examine how the pseudo sentence invitation are done during each EM iteration. For later iterations we observe a better pseudo-precision and pseudo-recall at sentencelevel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>(a), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(b)</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> also reveals a good learning capacity of our learning framework. Nevertheless, we observe that the baselines do not work well for this task. This is not new, as pointed out in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cuong and Sima'an, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Which component type contributes more to the performance, the latent domain language models or the latent domain translation models? Further experiments have been carried on to neutralize each component type in turn and build a selection system with the rest of our model parameters. It turns out that the latent domain translation models are crucial for performance for the learning framework, while the latent domain LMs make a far smaller yet substantial contribution. We refer readers to our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cuong and Sima'an, 2014)</ref>, which provides detail analysis of the data selection problem.</p></div>

We limit phrase length to a maximum of seven words. The LMs are interpolated 4-grams with Kneser-Ney, trained on 2.2M English sentences from Europarl augmented with 248.8K sentences from News Commentary Corpus (WMT 2013).

For every system reported, we run the optimizer at least three times, before running MultEval <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clark et al., 2011)</ref> for resampling and significance testing. Outlook In Section 5 we examine the effect of training only the latent domain-focused phrase table using our model. In Section 6 we proceed further to estimate also latent domain-focused lexical weights and lexicalized reordering models, examining how they incrementally improve the translation as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Adapting phrase table only</head><p>Here we investigate the effect of adapting the phrase table only; we will delay adapting the lexical weights and lexicalized reordering features to Section 6. We build a phrase-based system with the usual features as the baseline, including two bi-directional phrase-based models, plus the penalties for word, phrase and distortion. We also build a latent domain-focused phrasebased system with the two bi-directional latent phrase-based models, and the standard penalties described above.</p><p>We explore training data sizes 1M , 2M and 4M sentence pairs. Three baselines are trained yielding 95.77M , 176.29M and 323.88M phrases respectively. We run 5 EM iterations to train our learning framework. We use the parameter estimates for P (D | ẽ, f ) derived at each EM iteration to train our latent domain-focused phrase-based systems. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> presents the results (in BLEU) at each iteration in detail for the case of 1M sentence pairs. Similar improvements are observed for METEOR and TER. Here, we consistently observe improvements at p-value = 0.0001 for all cases.</p><p>It should be noted that when doubling the training data to 2M and 4M , we observe the similar results.</p><p>Finally, for all cases we report their best result in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. Here, note how the improvement could be gained when doubling the training data.  Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hasler et al., 2014)</ref> in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> we also show that the entropy decreases significantly in the adapted tables in all cases, which indicates that the distributions over translations of phrases have become sharper.  In practice, the third iteration systems usually produce best translations. This is somewhat expected because as EM invites more pseudo indomain pairs in later iterations, it sharpens the estimates of P (D 1 | ẽ, f ), making pseudo outdomain pairs tend to 0.0. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref> shows the percentage of entries with P (D 1 | ẽ, f ) &lt; 0.01 at every iteration, e.g., 34.52% at the fifth iteration. This induced schism in C mix diminishes the difference between the relevance scores for certain sentence pairs, limiting the ability of the latent phrase-based models to further discriminate in the gray zone. Finally, to give a sense of the improvement in translation, we (randomly) select cases where the systems produce different translations and present some of them in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. These examples are indeed illuminating, e.g., "can reproduce signs of audio"/"can play signals audio", "password teacher"/"password master", revealing thoroughly the benefit derived from adapting the phrase models from being domain-confused to being domain-focused. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> presents phrase table entries, i.e., p t (e | f ) and p t (e | f, D 1 ), for the "can reproduce signs of audio"/"can play signals audio" example.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Entries P (D 1 | f , ẽ) &lt; 0.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Fully adapted translation model</head><p>The preceding experiments reveal that adapting the phrase tables significantly improves translation performance. Now we also adapt the lexical Briefly, the lexical weights provide smooth estimates for the phrase pair based on word translation scores P (e | f ) between pairs of words e, f , i.e., P (e | f ) = c(e,f ) e c(e,f ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We present a novel approach for in-domain focused training of a phrase-based system on a mix-of-domain corpus by using prior distributions from a small in-domain corpus. We derive an EM training algorithm for learning latent domain relevance models for the phrase-and sentence-levels in tandem. We also show how to overcome the difficulty of lack of explicit out-domain data by bootstrapping pseudo out-domain data.</p><p>In future work, we plan to explore generative Bayesian models as well as discriminative learning approaches with different ways for estimat-ing the latent domain relevance models. We hypothesize that bilingual, but also monolingual, relevance models can be key to improved performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>P</head><label></label><figDesc>(D) := e,f ∈C mix P (D | e, f) D e,f ∈C mix P (D | e, f) model can be viewed to have latent parameters Θ = {Θ D 0 , Θ D 1 }.

We must also train the out-domain LMs, which needs the construction of pseudo out-domain data. 9 One simple way to do that is inspired by burnin in sampling, under the guidance of an indomain data set, C in as prior. At the beginning, we train P t (ẽ | f , D 1 ) and P t ( f | ẽ, D 1 ) for all phrases learned from C in . We also train P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ) for all phrases learned from C mix . During burn-in we assume that the out-domain phrase-based models are the domainconfused phrase-based models, i.e., P t (ẽ | f , D 0 )≈ P t (ẽ | f ) and P t ( f | ẽ, D 0 ) ≈ P t ( f | ẽ).We isolate all the LMs and the prior models from our model, and apply a single EM iteration to update P (D | e, f) based on those domain-focused models P t (ẽ | f , D) and P t ( f | ẽ, D).In the end, we use P (D | e, f) to fill in the values of hidden variable D in C mix , so it provides us with an initialization for P (D | ẽ, f ).
