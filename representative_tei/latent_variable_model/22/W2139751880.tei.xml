<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Structural equation models (SEMs) are becoming increasingly popular in health research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bandeen-Roche et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budtz-Joergensen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Liu, Wall, and Hodges, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Proust et al., 2006)</ref>. This modeling framework is useful in analyzing data from studies where multivariate outcomes or multiple, highly correlated predictors, for example surrogates of an exposure, have been collected. Through the use of latent variables, SEMs succinctly describe associations between multivariate predictors and multivariate outcomes, and alleviate issues of multiple comparisons and collinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sánchez et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Classical fitting methods for these models depend on distributional and linearity assumptions that are important to check. Distributional assumptions are required for using readily available fitting procedures in the presence of data missing at random <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Little and Rubin, 2002)</ref>, for example in the Mplus software <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Muthén and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Muthén, 1998-2004)</ref>. Although procedures that relax distributional assumptions have been developed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Browne, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arminger and Schoenberg, 1989)</ref>, they work correctly only under data missing completely at random. Further, distributional assumptions are desirable because of improved efficiency, especially when small effect sizes may be expected. Deviations from the assumed distribution lead to biased standard errors, and may hinder the predictive ability of the model. Deviations from linearity are also problematic, but are difficult to explore prior to modeling since the latent variables are unobserved. An incorrect linearity assumption among latent variables leads to, for example, incorrect estimation of exposure effects (e.g., nonlinear doseresponse). Further, incorrectly assuming linear relationships between a latent variable and one of its observed indicators is also problematic because it may preclude the comparison of latent variable means across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bauer, 2005)</ref>. Although procedures that relax linearity assumptions have also been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wall and Amemiya, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carroll et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee and Song, 2004)</ref>, their use has remained relatively limited. Hence, it is of interest to develop tools to check linearity and distributional assumptions for SEMs with latent variables.</p><p>Diagnostics tools for SEMs that are based on individuallevel residuals is an area that has received little attention, although some notable references exist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lee and Lu (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee and Tang (2004)</ref>, for example, propose computationally efficient diagnostics to assess the degree of influence a particular observation may have on the estimated model parameters, and model fit. Their methods can be viewed as generalizations of Cook's distance to SEMs. Other authors have used ad hoc diagnostics to check for model fit, such as examining standardized residuals against quantiles from a standard normal distribution. However, such diagnostics do not account for having estimated model parameters with the same data. Not accounting for parameter estimation may affect the Type I error rates of goodness-of-fit tests derived from such ad hoc procedures.</p><p>We propose and evaluate a variety of graphical procedures and associated statistical tests to examine distribution and linearity assumptions. Their theoretical basis rests on recent developments in diagnostic methodology for linear mixed models, as follows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Houseman, Ryan, and Coull (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Houseman, Coull, and Ryan (2006)</ref> developed theory and methods to test the normality assumption of the error term in a linear model for correlated data, including linear mixed models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pan and Lin (2005)</ref> provide theoretical results and methodology to check the deterministic component of linear mixed models. Both methodologies directly apply to linear SEMs because SEMs have many overlaps with linear mixed 104 C 2008, The International Biometric Society models. Specifically, SEMs, like linear mixed models, imply a structured mean and variance for the marginal moments of the data. This similarity is sufficient for the methodologies to apply. We adapt both methods to structural equation modeling. Key issues in adapting their methods to SEMs are defining residuals for the various error components of the model, and adequately weighting observations in the presence of missing data. We evaluate properties of the diagnostics not previously examined because of the complexity of SEMs in contrast to linear mixed models. The proposed methods are graphical in nature, such that they provide information on the type of misspecification. We also provide test statistics to assess significance of lack of fit.</p><p>The motivation for this work comes from a study of fetal lead exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tellez-Rojo et al., 2004)</ref>. Some of the study aims are to quantify the relative contribution of endogenous (e.g., bone lead concentration) versus exogenous (e.g., use of lead contaminated ceramics) sources of exposure and to understand how maternal characteristics impact fetal lead exposure levels. The exposure data collected are high dimensional: various biomarkers and survey data are collected on the mother pre-pregnancy and three or four times during and after pregnancy. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows a list of observed biomarkers used in this analysis and their timing. The sample size is 209, although there is a large number of missing data patterns, and higher percentages of missing data occur at the earlier stages of pregnancy when recruitment is more difficult. We model these data with a structural equation model with la-  tent variables, represented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which reduces the dimensionality of the data and succinctly describes associations between lead concentrations in various media.</p><p>In Section 2, we define linear structural equation models with latent variables. In Section 3, we propose distribution and linearity diagnostics for SEMs. Section 4 presents results from simulation studies evaluating the empirical size and power of the proposed tests. In Section 5, we demonstrate the utility of these diagnostics by applying them to the study of in utero lead exposure. In Section 6, we state our conclusions and suggest directions for future work.</p></div>

We use maximum likelihood estimation to obtain parameter estimates, but refer the reader elsewhere for estimation details (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sánchez et al., 2005)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Residual-Based Diagnostics</head><p>The model specification assumes linearity, and maximum likelihood estimation requires distributional assumptions; either or both assumptions could be violated. The distributions of either the latent variable errors, or the conditional errors, or both, can deviate from normality. Given the linearity assumptions at both stages of the model, there are at least four possibilities for misspecification. In (2), one could misspecify (a) the functional form of a covariate on a latent variable or (b) the link between a latent variable and its linear predictor; and in (1), (c) the functional form of a covariate on a surrogate or (d) the link between a surrogate and its linear predictor. To propose diagnostics to check these assumptions, we first define several types of residuals. Residuals similar to ours have been described previously by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bollen and Arminger (1991)</ref>.</p><p>Standardized marginal residuals for the ith subject are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r i = Σ -1/2 (X i -µ i ),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where Σ 1/2 is the square root of Σ. Because these residuals have zero mean, variance one, and are uncorrelated, they lend themselves to regression diagnostics for independent data. Because the marginal residuals encompass both the conditional and latent variable error, they will serve to define an omnibus test of fit.</p><p>Next we define the kth conditional and gth latent variable residuals based on standardized estimates of the respective components of the conditional and latent variable error vectors. Estimates of the errors ik and ζ ig are obtained by taking their conditional expectation, given the observed data. As de-</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">tailed in Web Appendix A, E( ik | X i ) = π c k Σ Σ -1 (X i -µ i ), where π c k is a (1 × p) matrix that selects the kth compo- nent of E( i | X i ), i.e., it is zero everywhere except at the (1, k) position, which is one. Similarly, E(ζ ig | X i ) = π g Ψ(I - B) -1 Λ T Σ -1 (X i -µ i ), where π g selects the gth component of E(ζ i | X i ).</formula><p>To standardize, first note that the conditional expectations above can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E( ik | X i ) = C k Σ -1/2 (X i -µ i ) and E(ζ ig | X i ) = D g Σ -1/2 (X i -µ i ), where C k = π c k Σ Σ -1/2 and D g = π g Ψ(I -B) -1 ΛΣ -1/2 . Then, letting P c k = (C k C T k ) -1/2 C k , and P g = (D g D T g ) -1/2 D g , we arrive at r c,k i = P c k r i , (conditional) (6) r ,g i = P g r i (latent),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>which are standardized conditional and latent variable residuals. Standardizing is important in the presence of missing data, as the estimated residuals will have different variabilities. Web Appendix B details how the definitions of the residuals are affected by missing data. Also note that the conditional and latent variable residuals are linear combinations, or projections, of the marginal residuals r i defined in (5). The projections play a role in defining the diagnostics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Distribution Diagnostics</head><p>To assess normality assumptions, we first describe the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of the above defined residuals, and later define ECDF-based test statistics. Because the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is difficult to obtain analytically, we then discuss an efficient simulation technique to compute p-values.</p><p>To construct an omnibus test of normality, consider the ECDF of the standardized marginal residuals r = (r T 1 , r T 2 , . . . , r T n ) T . For a fixed value of t in the real line, this ECDF is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">F pn (t; θ, r) = (pn) -1 n i=1 p k=1 1{r ik ≤ t}, (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where r ik is the kth component of the ith subject's standardized marginal residuals, r i . Under the null hypothesis that i and ζ i are normally distributed, and assuming that the marginal mean, µ i , and variance, Σ, are correctly specified, then (8) evaluated at θ = θ 0 , the true value of θ, approximates the standard normal cumulative distribution function, Φ(t). Large deviations of (8) from Φ(t) would indicate that either the latent variable errors, or the conditional errors, or both, are not normally distributed. To construct tests for lack of normality for the kth or gth conditional errors latent variable errors, ik or ζ ig , consider the ECDF of the residuals in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">7</ref>). For a given matrix P (e.g., P = P c k or P = P g ), the ECDF of the residuals is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">F n (t; θ, P, r) = n -1 n i=1 1{Pr i ≤ t}.</formula><p>(9)</p><p>Thus, for example, under the null hypothesis that k is normally distributed, and assuming that µ i and Σ are correctly specified, F n (t; θ = θ 0 , P = P c k , r) should approximate Φ(t). Standard normality tests (van der Vaart, 1998) cannot be conducted to assess the significance of the observed differences between the ECDFs and Φ(t) because θ 0 is unknown. Instead, a variety of test statistics capturing the discrepancy between the ECDFs and Φ(t) can be defined. For instance, we compute test statistics similar to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and the Cramér-Von Mises (CVM) test, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">τ KS = sup | F n (t; θ, P, r) -Φ(t) | , and τ CVM = (F n (t; θ, P, r) -Φ(t)) 2 dΦ(t).</formula><p>The null distribution of test statistics like τ KS and τ CVM , which adjust for the estimation of θ, are difficult to obtain analytically but can be approximated by simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Houseman et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Houseman et al., , 2006))</ref>. That is, first simulate the behavior of the discrepancies F pn (t; θ, r) -Φ(t) or F n (t; θ, P, r) -Φ(t) under the null hypothesis; then compute the statistics, τ KS and τ CVM , over many simulations; and finally obtain a p-value by calculating the proportion of simulated test statistics that are larger than the observed statistic.</p><p>Under the null hypothesis, the behavior of F pn (t; θ, r) -Φ(t) and F n (t; θ, P, r) -Φ(t) can be simulated by computing realizations of the stochastic processes in t</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F * pn (t) -Φ(t) = F pn (t; θ, r * ) -Φ(t)</formula><p>+ δ pn (t, θ, θ) T J( θ) -1 S( θ, r * ), and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">F * n (t) -Φ(t) = F n (t; θ, P, r * ) -Φ(t) + δ n (t, θ, θ) T J( θ) -1 S( θ, r * ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Diagnostics for Linearity</head><p>To assess departures from linearity, we propose tests based on cumulative sums of projected residuals, r c,k i or r ,g i , taken with respect to covariate values or certain predicted values (e.g., E(X ik ) or E(U ig )).

In contrast to residual plots, the asymptotic behavior of the sums can be approximated via simulation such that inference, and thus objective conclusions, regarding lack of linearity can be drawn.

The cumulative sums of residuals define stochastic processes in t, which, under the null hypothesis, fluctuate around zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pan and Lin, 2005)</ref>. Hence, unusually large departures from zero are indicative of model misspecification. Departures from zero can be characterized by test statistics defined as functionals, (•), of the cumulative sums; for example, the sup and L 2 norms,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">∞ (W (t)) = sup t | W (t) | , and 2 (W (t)) = t (W (t)) 2 dt,</formula><p>can be used. These are analogous to the KS and CVM tests for normality.</p><p>The asymptotic behavior of such test statistics, however, is difficult to obtain analytically. Instead, the null distribution of the functional-based test statistics, (•) is approximated via simulation. Specifically, we draw realizations of the stochastic processes ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">15</ref>) under the null hypothesis; calculate the statistics on each of many realizations; and compute p-values as the proportion of simulated statistics that exceed the observed test statistic. Under the null hypothesis, realizations of the cumulative sums of residuals can be simulated as follows. First, note that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">14</ref>) are special cases of a multivariate stochastic process</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">W Z (t) = n -1/2 n i=1 1{Z i ≤ t}Pr i , (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where t = (t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t q ), and 1{Z i ≤ t} = p k=1 1{Z k ≤ t k }, and P is P c k or P g .

Repeated realizations of W Z (t) can be obtained by fixing the observed data, and drawing samples of (G 1 , G 2 , . . . G n ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Distribution Diagnostics</head><p>We evaluated the power of the distribution tests to detect lack of normality in a specific component of the latent variable error or in a specific component of the conditional error. We simulated data using skewed (centered χ 2 3 ) or heavy-tailed (t 3 ) distributions. We considered scenarios where either the conditional error i1 or the latent variable error ζ i1 was nonnormal, as well as cases where both i1 and ζ i1 deviated from normality. We conducted tests of normality on the conditional and the latent variable residuals, as well as the omnibus test.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> illustrates the empirical size and power for tests of nominal size 0.05. The top half of the table shows results for the CVM tests, while the bottom half shows results for the KS tests. In general, the simulation-based tests proposed here perform well in terms of power, and are within Monte Carlo error of the nominal size. For every type of misspecification, the CVM test was more powerful than the KS test. The test for lack of normality of the conditional error was, in general, more powerful than the test for the latent variable error (e.g., compare Alternatives 1 and 2 under the 50% error column). Similarly, the omnibus test had slightly more power to detect a misspecified distribution for i1 than ζ i1 , and had high power when both distributions were misspecified. As expected, larger measurement error variance decreases the power of the tests. Finally, and most importantly, the tests were specific to the stage of the model containing the deviation from normality. If the conditional error was not normal while the latent variable residual was normal, then the test conducted on the latent variable residuals preserved its Type-1 error rate, and vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Linearity Diagnostics</head><p>We evaluated the performance of linearity tests based on cumulative residuals. In scenarios where the functional form of a covariate is misspecified, at either stage of the model, we also evaluated the power of the corresponding link test, and the CVM normality test <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eberly and Thackeray, 2005</ref>, show that normality tests can detect misspecified mean functions). For comparison, we also evaluate the power of the Wald test of the null hypothesis when fitting the model under the (correct) alternative hypothesis. The Wald test was only possible for cases when the null was nested in the alternative.</p><p>To investigate the power of the test of the functional form of a covariate for the mean of a latent variable, we considered three alternatives for the structural part of the model</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">Model 1a: U 1i = γ 11 Z 1i + γ 12 Z 2i + γ 13 Z 2 2i + ζ 1i , Model 1b: U 1i = γ 11 Z 1i + γ 12 exp(Z 2i ) + ζ 1i , Model 1c: U 1i = γ 11 Z 1i + γ 12 Z 2i + γ 13 Z 3i + ζ 1i ,</formula><p>where Z 3i ∼ Normal(0,1), and independent from (Z 1i , Z 2i ). Models 1a and 1b represent scenarios where a quadratic term should be included in the linear predictor for U 1i , and where the covariate was incorrectly log -transformed. Model 1c implies Z 3i is missing from the model specification. We use data on Z 3 to construct the cumulative sum diagnostic; for example, mother's age in the example section, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>. The power of the link test between covariates and a latent </p><formula xml:id="formula_35">(U 1i ) = γ 11 Z 1i + γ 12 Z 2i + ζ 1i .</formula><p>To evaluate the power of the test of the functional form of a covariate on a surrogate, we considered two alternatives for the measurement part of the model Model 3a:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">X 3i = ν 3 + λ 3 U 1i + κZ 1i + 3i , Model 3b: X 3i = ν 3 + λ 3 U 1i + λU 2 1i + 3i .</formula><p>Given that the assumed model does not include covariates in the measurement part of the model, the misspecification represented by Model 3a corresponds to item bias. Similar to Model 1c, data on Z 1 is used to construct the diagnostic. Model 3b corresponds to a nonlinear association between the latent variable and the observed surrogate. In this case, U 1 is already in the model, but the diagnostic still uses an estimate of U 1 , E(U 1 ), to construct the cumulative sum. Finally, to investigate the power of the test of link between a surrogate and its predictors, we considered the following alternative for the measurement model</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">Model 4: g(X 3i ) = ν 3 + λ 3 U 1i + 3i ,</formula><p>where g(•) is a nonlinear link function.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> show the empirical sizes and power for the linearity tests considered. The empirical sizes of the tests based on the cumulative sums of residuals are within Monte Carlo error of the nominal size. The cumulative sum tests based on the latent variable residuals enjoy reasonable power in larger sample sizes, although their power is reduced with increasing measurement error variance in the surrogates. In contrast to linear mixed models, the link tests had little power to detect misspecified functional forms of covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pan and Lin, 2005)</ref>; the power never exceeded 30% (not shown). The test evaluating the functional form of the covariates on either the latent or surrogate variables have good power. Under all scenarios, the CVM-type test 2 (•) is more powerful than the KS-type test ∞ (•). The normality test, as expected, detected misspecified means in some settings. The power of the Wald test is greater, but the test requires a correctly specified, nested alternative.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Measurement Model</head><p>We relate the blood-based biomarkers to latent circulating lead as follows. At time t, t = 0, 1, 2, 3 (before pregnancy, and trimesters 1, 2, 3) let,</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">X 1t = U t + 1t Model for Plasma Lead X 2t = ν 2t + λ 2 U t + 2t Model for Blood Lead, ABC Laboratory X 3t = ν 3t + λ 3 U t + 3t Model for Blood Lead,</formula><p>Smith Laboratory</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">X 43 = ν 43 + λ 43 U 3 + 43 Model for Cord Blood Lead,</formula><p>where U t represents circulating lead at time t. Circulating lead takes the units of plasma lead, both in terms of its scale as well as central tendency because λ 1 = 1 and ν 1t = 0. The model is weakly time invariant <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bollen, 1989)</ref> because the only parameters not allowed to vary over time are the factor loadings, λ-i.e., the associations between the scales of the latent and observed variables do not change over time. To account for laboratory effects in the blood lead concentrations, we allow 2 = ( 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ) T and 3 = ( 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ) T to have banded correlation structures, but 2 and 3 are assumed to be independent; i.e., for j = 2, 3, corr( jt , j;t+k ) = 0 for k = 1, but is 0 for k &gt; 1, and corr( jt ; j t ) = 0 for j = j . Bone resorption rates, measured at t = 1, 2, 3, are modeled using a mixed effects model, X t4 = U 4 + κt + t4 , where U 4 ∼ Normal(α 4 , ψ 4 ) represents a random intercept, and κ is a fixed time effect. The random intercept can be interpreted as the mother's intrinsic resorption rates. The model for bone lead concentrations is</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">X 15 = U 5 + 15</formula><p>Patella lead, before pregnancy which assumes that bone lead burden, U 5 , is measured in units of patella lead concentration. The population average for bone lead burden is assumed to be equal to the average observed for patella lead before pregnancy. After pregnancy this concentration is, on average, ν 35 units different from that before pregnancy (i.e., fixed time effect). Tibia lead concentration is also a surrogate of bone lead burden; 1 unit of patella lead is roughly equivalent to λ 25 units of tibia lead before and after pregnancy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Associations Between Latent Variables</head><p>We impose a longitudinal model on latent circulating-lead exposure. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">U t = α t + β 1 U 4 + β 2 U 5 + γ 1 Z 1 + γ 2 Z 2 + γ 3 Z 3 + ζ t</formula><p>, where α t is a trimester-specific mean (to avoid assumptions on the trend of the latent variables). The effects of bone resorption rates, U 4 , and bone lead burden, U 5 , on circulating lead are given by β 1 and β 2 , respectively. The covariance of ζ t , t = 0, 1, 2, 3 is modeled as a bandedheterogeneous matrix. The model defined for the blood-based lead biomarkers can be seen as a latent variable model for longitudinal data with multiple continuous outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Roy and Lin, 2000)</ref>, except that here latent variables are also predictors. Finally, we model the effects of covariates on bone lead burden:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">U 5 = α 5 + γ 15 Z 1 + γ 25 Z 2 + γ 35 Z 3 + ζ 5</formula><p>, where ζ 5 is assumed to be independent from ζ 4 and from ζ t , t = 0, 1, 2, 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Diagnostics</head><p>Given the variety of residuals and available tests, a strategy for the order in which model assumptions are evaluated is needed. Since the distribution tests require correct mean and variance specification, we apply linearity tests first. Specifically, we use linearity diagnostics to detect whether covariates are missing from the model misspecification, or whether linear relationships are incorrectly specified. We then inspect distributional assumptions by first using the omnibus test for normality, then checking the distributions of the latent variable residuals, and, finally, examining the conditional residuals.</p><p>Here we show a sample of the diagnostic results to illustrate the use of the methods. After fitting a model, it may be of interest to assess whether additional covariates should be added to it. For instance, we considered adding maternal education as a predictor of latent circulating lead exposure. A sensible approach may be to plot the circulating lead exposure residuals against education and fit a regression line (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). In this case, the p-value obtained from a regression of the residuals against maternal education suggests that education should be added as a predictor. However, inferences from such an approach may be problematic as they do not adjust for the estimation of θ. Thus, we analyze the cumulative sum of the circulating lead residuals with respect to education (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). Although the observed cumulative sum appears to deviate from the simulated sums (light lines), objective inference based on the simulated p-value does not call for adding education as a predictor. Nevertheless, we fitted a model including education as a predictor of trimester 1 exposure. From the corresponding Wald test, we concluded education was not a statistically significant predictor of circulating lead exposure.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> displays the cumulative sum of latent resorption rate residuals with respect to maternal age. The observed cumulative sum clearly stands out from the simulated sums. The drastic increase in the sum indicates a preponderance of positive residuals at younger ages, and the sharp decrease indicates an excess of negative residuals at older ages. This pattern in the residuals and their cumulative sum is consistent with a missing linear term for age (Z 1 ), and thus suggests modeling: U 4 = α 4 + γ 14 Z 1 + ζ 4 . We included the term γ 14 Z 1 in the model, and again calculated the cumulative sum of the bone resorption residuals with respect to age. From the updated plot and test, we concluded there was no significant association between the bone resorption rate residuals and maternal age, thereby suggesting that a linear term may be sufficient in modeling the bone resorption rate-age association.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> presents the cumulative sum of conditional residuals for patella lead concentration. The observed sum is well within the cloud of simulated sums. Thus, no evidence exists of a misspecified association between patella lead concentration and age. Similarly, cumulatively summing the residuals of plasma lead concentrations gave no evidence of a misspecified links between the plasma biomarkers and its predictors (not shown).</p><p>Next we examine distributional assumptions. We first conducted an omnibus test of normality based on the standardized marginal residuals, and concluded significant lack of normality. However, the omnibus test provides no indication of which residuals ζ or violate the normality assumption. Therefore, we examined the conditional and latent components of the error separately. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref> show Q-Q plots for two of the six latent variable residuals in the model, point-wise confidence intervals calculated using the variance estimator proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Houseman et al. (2004)</ref>, and p-values for the KS and CVM type tests. There was no violation of normality in the distribution latent variable residuals for bone resorption rates. In contrast, the distributions of (latent) circulating lead residuals violate normality assumptions. The shape of the Q-Q plot would instead suggest a left-skewed distribution.</p><p>Next, we inspected the conditional error distributions. The conditional residuals for both bone lead concentrations (before and after) and blood lead concentrations (both laboratories, at every trimester) did not deviate significantly from normality. The bone resorption concentrations reveal deviation from normality at trimester 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>). The conditional residuals for plasma lead show marginally significant lack of normality (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>); the Q-Q plot is indicative of a heavy tailed error distribution. Thus, a t or logistic distribution might instead be considered for these conditional errors. Note that these figures show the specificity of the normality tests; that is, the latent variable residuals for the bone resorption rates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>) do not appear to violate normality assumptions, whereas one of its surrogates does (NTX, T2, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We proposed and implemented residual-based diagnostics that assess distributional and linearity assumptions commonly made in classical SEMs. The diagnostics are based on three types of residuals that isolate the various sources of error in the model, namely, marginal, conditional, and latent variable residuals. The theoretical basis for making inferences based on the proposed diagnostics follows from research on residual diagnostics for linear mixed models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Houseman et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Houseman et al., , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pan and Lin, 2005)</ref>. Both tests are adjusted for the estimation of all model parameters, although more simple adjustments for parameter estimation may be sufficient for the normality tests (see Web Appendix D). The proposed diagnostics improve upon available model specification tools for SEMs because they not only lend themselves to graphical displays, but are also based on individual-level residuals. Classical model specification tools, such as modification and χ 2 fit indices, are based on aggregate forms of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beck, 1982)</ref>, and require specific alternatives to test against.</p><p>Further research is needed on the sequence in which these diagnostics should be implemented; that is, there is possible confounding between various types of model misspecification <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eberly and Thackeray, 2005)</ref>. We examined linearity assumptions before normality assumptions because distribution diagnostics assume correctly specified mean and variances; but diagnostics for linearity may not necessitate correctly specified error distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pan and Lin, 2005</ref>; also see Web Appendix E).</p><p>Furthermore, because in SEMs incorrect covariance assumptions on the error terms leads to biased conditional mean parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sammel and Ryan, 2002)</ref> it is unclear whether testing the default linear associations in SEMs may also require correctly specified covariance structures for the errors. This is in contrast to diagnostics for linear mixed models, where correctly specified covariance matrices are not required to make inferences on the predictive part of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pan and Lin, 2005)</ref>. Thus, developing projection matrices based on robust variance matrices might be a promising next step. Developing methods to assess the covariance matrices of the errors might also be of interest.</p></div>
