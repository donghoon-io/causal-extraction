<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the applicability of logistics capability for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk and improving logistics performance in the Australian courier industry. Based on the resource-based view, a quantitative research study is designed to investigate the relationships among three latent variables: logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk, and logistics performance. Structural equation modelling is used to analyse the data. The results indicate that there are significant relationships between logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk, and logistics performance. The results provide insights into supply chain uncertainty and risk management.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Due to the increased supply chain complexity, higher customer expectations, shorter product and technology life cycles, and unstable environment, supply chain uncertainty and risk have become major obstacles to achieving on time delivery, increasing customer satisfaction, improving the efficiency and reducing costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Christopher and Lee 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Christopher and Peck 2004</ref>). In addition, the worldwide trend in globalization has led to firms outsourcing their logistics function to the third-party logistics (3PL) providers. One of the significant advantages of using 3PLs is transferring the supply chain uncertainties and risks to the 3PLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Zsidisin and Ritchie 2009)</ref>. However, 3PLs have to manage these uncertainties and risks. 3PLs now face more uncertainties and risks than ever <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Marasco 2008)</ref>. Courier is a typical 3PL model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cowles 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the resource-based view theory, each firm is a unique bundle of resources and capabilities that provided the basis for its competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mohamed, Ann, and Yee 2014)</ref>. A firm has to establish logistics capability focusing on delivery speed, quality service, flexibility, cost, and innovation in order to achieve optimal logistics performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fawcett and Stanley 1997)</ref>. In other words, logistics capability may improve the logistics performance. In contrast, supply chain uncertainty and risk is an issue in supply chain and logistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Prater 2005)</ref>. It has negative impacts on logistics performance such as delays, damages and customer satisfaction (Sanchez- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rodrigues et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Simangunsong et al. 2012</ref>). Many businesses do not have a Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreas 2013)</ref>. Especially, courier businesses need SCRM to improve their performance. In addition, the knowledge of managing supply chain risk and uncertainty is very limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Peck 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sanchez-Rodrigues et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Waters 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zsidisin and Ritchie 2009)</ref>. Therefore, this study examines the applicability of logistics capability for mitigating the supply Operations and Supply Chain Management 11(1) pp. <ref type="bibr">45 -54 © 2018</ref> chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve logistics performance. This may draw attention to the advancement of resource based view approach for supply chain uncertainty and risk management.</p><p>Traditional risk management focuses on rare and extreme events, and events with low probabilities and high consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aven 2012)</ref>. However, for managers the greatest threat is often from the day-to-day operations in supply chain. We consider the resolutions on mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk simultaneously, because the managers have to manage both supply chain uncertainty and risk at the same time. Sometimes, a little problem or mistake may cause supply chain disruption in a real world environment. In addition, supply chain uncertainty and risk are often happened together, they both influence decision makers in the supply chain resulting in ineffectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vorst and Beulens 2002)</ref>. This study measures the impact of both supply chain uncertainty and risk, they both have very similar impacts in logistics and transport firms (Sanchez- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rodrigues et al. 2009)</ref>. And the problem has been raised in many previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Simangunsong et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sanchez-Rodrigues et al. 2010)</ref>. Therefore, this study focuses on the approach for mitigating both supply chain uncertainty and risk. The empirical study offers opportunities for theory building and verification, which is important for the advancement of supply chain uncertainty and risk management.</p><p>In the paper, we examine the applicability of logistics capability for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve logistics performance. We empirically analyse a key question: whether or not logistics capability can be used for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve the logistics performance. To answer the question, we construct a research model, in which the effect of logistics capability on logistics performance is mediated by the supply chain uncertainty and risk. Empirical evidence is gathered from 98 Australian courier firms. The partial least squares approach for structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis is used for analysing the model. PLS-SEM is an approach to structural equation modelling. In SmartPLS, the PLS algorithm estimates the values for latent variables (factor scores) in an iterative procedure. The idea is to first construct each latent variable by the sum of its observed variables, then in the inner approximation to try to reconstruct each latent variable by means of its neighbouring latent variables and in the outer approximation to find the best linear combination to express each latent variable by means of its observed variables. The coefficients are referred to as outer weights. Finally, each latent variable is constructed as weighted sum or linear combination of its observed variables. It is a conceptual approach to data analysis involving the interplay of theoretical thinking and empirical data. The results indicate that the measurement models have high reliability and validity and there are significant relationships between logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk, and logistics performance in the structural model. The empirical evidence supports the idea of mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk.</p><p>The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. The literature review and hypothesis is presented in Section 2. Section 3 describes operationalization and dataset. In section 4, we use a partial least squares (PLS) approach to analyse the model. In section 5, we summarize and discuss the findings. The final section provides the conclusions of the paper and the recommendations for future research.</p></div>

The resource-based view of the firm provides important insights for understanding how competitive advantage within firms is created and how such advantage is sustained over time. Briefly, resource-based view theory states that firms obtain competitive advantage by accumulating internal resources and capabilities that are rare, valuable, and difficult to imitate <ref type="bibr">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. Thus, one of the main objectives for firms applying a resource-based view is to identify their capabilities and develop them further <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Day, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Capability is an ability to make use of resource to perform some task or activity and defined a resource as anything tangible or intangible owned or acquired by a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hafeez et al. 2002)</ref>.

The day-to-day supply chain uncertainty and risk, which most managers want to deal with imminently in a real world environment. Moreover, the managers have to face and manage the supply chain uncertainty and risk at the same time. The study indirectly measures the impacts of both supply chain uncertainty and risk in the logistics and transport firms, rather than directly calculate the probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al. 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the study does not separate supply chain uncertainty and risk.</p><p>Resource-based view provides special lens to review the supply chain uncertainty and risk management in a firm.

As mentioned previously, customer related uncertainty and risk are most likely occurred between the logistics companies and customers. There is a very close relationship between courier firms and customers, the customers may directly affect the logistics performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Instrument Development</head><p>In this section, we develop an instrument to measure the three main constructs including logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk and logistics performance. An extensive literature review was conducted to identify the key constructs. Considering the measures of logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk, and logistics performance, we measures respondents' opinions. The questionnaire is structured and presented on a 7-point Likert scale. Rensis Likert developed the scale in 1932. Likert-type scales are considered as reliable and are recommended for obtaining people's attitudes, values and perceptions. It allows the individuals to make a decision based on the level of agreement. This is a common format for assessing participants' opinions of usability. In the seven point likerttype scale used in this study the value "1" represents 'Strongly disagree' or 'No problem' and the value "7" represents 'Strongly agree' or 'Very severe problem'.</p><p>The multiple-item measures of logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk, and logistics performance are derived from previous researches. In order to ensure the content validity, a pilot study is conducted to test the questionnaire before conducting a comprehensive survey. It was discussed with managers from Australia's leading courier firms and supply chain and logistics academics. The respondents are asked to rate how the respondents consider logistics capability and logistics performance in their firms compared to the major competitors in the market. There are very few studies on the Australian courier firms. Although the measures were adopted from previous studies, they are used for the first time in the Australian courier firms in this research. Therefore, the item measures were assessed by factor analysis, in order to generate a reliable and accurate instrument for the Australian courier firms. In terms of the measures of supply chain uncertainty and risk, we measure the severity of impact of uncertainties and risks in the Australian courier firms. The scale of supply chain uncertainties and risks is adopted from a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al. 2014)</ref>. Results indicate the instrument has a high level of reliability and validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Collection</head><p>This section presents the data collection used to conduct the research. Purposive sampling is used in this study. It is defined as selecting a sample in a systematic or purposive way, based on what we know about our target population and the purpose of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Walter 2013)</ref>. In this study, a survey population was selected from the Australian business register online and yellow page online. Total 98 courier firms are identified and invited to participate the study in Australia. The practitioners, who work in the Australian courier industry, have been approached by emails and telephone calls. The empirical data was collected through a web-based survey. There are five states and three territories in Australia. In order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of data collection, the web-based survey is chosen as the main data collection instrument in the study. The questionnaire is designed to ensure objectivity, generalizability and reliability by conducting statistical techniques. The participators can access the questionnaire via the internet 24/7. It provides greater flexibility for practitioners to answer the questions.</p><p>Overall, 75% of respondents hold management positions including senior managers, operations managers and supervisors. 18% of respondents were company employees including customer service, sales and operations staff and 7% of respondents were independent contractors including truck drivers and couriers. In addition, 38% of respondents were from Victoria, 25% of respondents were from New South Wales,9% of respondents were from Queensland, 8% of respondents were from Western Australia, 7% of respondents were from South Australia, and rest of respondents were from Australian Capital Territory (4%), Northern Territory (5%) and Tasmania (4%). The cases with any missing values are excluded from analysis. With an approximate survey response rate of 20%, total 167 valid questionnaires are used for data analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Analysis Using PLS-SEM</head><p>The partial least squares approach (PLS-SEM)is an approach for structural equation modelling. Many business studies used PLS-SEM as a primary tool to analyse the data <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al. 2012</ref>). Moreover, it has become a popular statistical technique in today's business research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Henseler et al. 2009)</ref>. The SmartPLS version 2.0.M3 statistical software package was chosen in this study. The SmartPLS can be obtained free of charge compared to other PLS software, such as XLSTAT-PLSPM. The SmartPLS provides a graphical user interface (GUI). It is easy to indicate the results of study and relationships in a model. In SmartPLS, PLS algorithm estimates the values for latent variables (factor scores) by an iterative procedure. The idea is to first construct each latent variable by the sum of its observed variables. Then in the inner approximation, we try to reconstruct each latent variable by means of its neighbouring latent variables. All variables are standardized to zero mean and unit variance. A bootstrapping approach is used to estimate the significance of path coefficients and item loadings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reliability and Validity</head><p>The measurements were tested for its reliability and validity. Reliability is an assessment of the degree of consistency between multiple measurements of a variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hair 2010)</ref>. This study applies reliability coefficient with Cronbach's alpha to test the reliability of the scale. The reliability is demonstrated by Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hair 2010</ref>). In the study all loadings are above the threshold of 0.7.The results indicate the measurements have a high level of reliability in the study.</p><p>Validity is an important dimension to indicate the degree of accuracy of measurements. Face / content validity are tested in a pilot study. This section examines both convergent validity and discriminant validity. Convergent validity assesses the degree to which two measures of the same concept are correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hair 2010)</ref>. High correlations are required to ensure the convergent validity, Composite reliability (CR) great than 0.7 is considered as a satisfaction level. In contrast, discriminant validity is the degree to which two conceptually similar concepts are distinct <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hair 2010)</ref>. Convergent validity is demonstrated by loadings greater than 0.700, average variance extracted (AVE) greater than 0.500, and Communalities greater than 0.500. Discriminant validity is demonstrated by the square root of the AVE being greater than any of the inter-construct correlations <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al. 2012)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>The path model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The estimation of the structural relationships in the model was conducted by using a bootstrap routine with 1,000 iterations. The bootstrapping sample relates to significances of p&lt;0.1 for t&gt;1.65, p&lt;0.05 for t&gt;1.96 and p&lt;0.001 for t&gt;2.58 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hair et al. 2010)</ref>. A confidence interval indicates how reliable survey results are. In applied practice, confidence intervals are typically stated at the 95% confidence level (p&lt;0.05 for t&gt;1.96 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zar 1984)</ref>.</p><p>A path coefficient is used for testing hypotheses in the paper. The standardised path estimates (â) represent the strength, direction and significance of the relationship between constructs. â is considered to be large, medium and small for values of greater than 0.37, 0.24 and 0.1, respectively. Absolute value of a path coefficient should be not greater than 1. Negative value stands for the negative relationship between two concepts. Positive value stands for the positive relationship. According to the literature review and data analysis, the hypotheses in this study are supported as indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The assessment of the model's quality is based on its ability to predict the endogenous constructs. The following criteria facilitate this assessment: Coefficient of determination (R²), and the effect size (f²) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hair et al. 2014)</ref>. The criterions are used for the assessing the path model. Based on the study, the R² of0.46 the overall model fit is good. Our model explains 46% of the variance of logistics performance. The effect size is calculated based on the increase in R² relative to the proportion of variance of the endogenous latent variable that remains unexplained <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Henseler et al. 2009</ref>). The formula is shown as follows f²= (R²in-R²ex)/(1-R²in). The value of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 can be viewed as a gauge for whether a predictor latent variable has a weak, medium, or large effect at the structural level <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Henseler et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cohen 1992)</ref>. We find that the logistics capability has the largest direct effect (f² = 0.42) on logistics performance in the model. Supply chain uncertainty and risk have weak effects (f² = 0.04) on logistics performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p>In recent years, supply chain uncertainty and risk have become a popular topic for both managers and academics. Although mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk were discussed in many previous studies, most of the studies focused on the identification and categorisation of supply chain uncertainty and risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Simangunsong et al. 2012)</ref>. This study provides a different angle on supply chain uncertainty and risk management. The study does not separate supply chain uncertainty and risk, because the study indirectly measures the impacts of both supply chain uncertainty and risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al. 2014)</ref>, they have very similar impacts in logistics and transport firms (Sanchez- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rodrigues et al. 2009)</ref>, and the model based on the actual operations in the Australian courier firms, the managers often have to deal with both supply chain uncertainty and risk simultaneously in a real-world environment. The results are not only used to identify the supply chain uncertainty and risk, but also we may use them to detect the resolutions to manage supply chain uncertainty and risk.</p><p>In the paper, we investigate the role of logistics capability for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk and improving logistics performance. In general, this study provides empirical evidence that logistics capability mitigates supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve logistics performance in the Australian courier industry. The results indicate there are significant relationships among the three constructs. This may imply the possibility of implementing logistics capability for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk and improving logistics performance. This idea is different from the idea of building the supply chain resilience. The two ideas have a similar strategy to manage supply chain uncertainty and risk by implementing capabilities. However, the idea of supply chain resilience focuses on the recovery and building additional ability and/or capacity for supply chain resilience, and solving the severity problems such as disruptions or natural disasters. In this study, the resource based review approach proposes that developing the firm capabilitylogistics capability to mitigate the supply chain uncertainty and risk in the day-to-day operations. Simultaneously, it may improve the logistics performance. In other words, managers may optimise and develop the existing internal resources and capability to conduct risk management; this approach may help them to merge and transfer the complex and expensive risk management activities into day-to-day business operations. This may help companies to reduce the cost of risk management. For example, the companies may not need to hire additional risk consultants to conduct risk management activities. In addition, the strategy may continue improving the firm capability to mitigate the risks and uncertainties. This would minimise the additional costs caused by the damages, disruptions, delays, etc.</p><p>The result support the original idea of logistics capability mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve logistics performance. It shows that supply chain uncertainty and risk have a negative impact on the logistics performance. In contrast, logistics capability has a significant positive impact on the logistics performance. Thus, it is possible to attempt to apply the logistics capability for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve logistics performance. Logistics capability may be used to generate new capabilities and competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olavarrieta and Ellinger 1997)</ref>. This may lead to improve the logistics performance. In addition, the result in line with the resource based review theory; we find that logistics capability is positively associated with logistics performance. Overall, the empirical evidence supports the idea of resource based review approach for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk. The idea has a significant difference from traditional risk management theory. It does not try to influence or alter the source of uncertainty and risk. Instead, it tries to find alternative ways to adapt and hence minimise the impact of uncertainty and risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presents that the logistics capability for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to improve logistics performance. The primary contribution is that we find empirical evidence of the resource based review approach for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk in the Australian courier firms. The study investigates the relationships among logistics capability, supply chain uncertainty and risk, and logistics performance. The findings indicate that there is a negative relationship between logistics capability and supply chain uncertainty and risk, there is a negative relationship between logistics capability and supply chain uncertainty and risk, and there is a positive relationship between logistics capability and logistics performance. The relationships imply that logistics capability mitigates supply chain uncertainty and risk and improves logistics performance. This provides us an opportunity to manage both supply chain uncertainty and risk and improve logistics performance simultaneously by developing and deploying logistics capability. It may draw attention to the resource based review approach for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk.</p><p>The results have important practice implications for development of a practical guidance for managers developing and deploying logistics capability to support and enable their supply chain risk management strategies. In Operations and Supply Chain Management 11(1) pp. 45 -54 © 2018 addition, the results may suggest alternative configurations for managers to resolve the problems, which may be caused by supply chain uncertainty and risk. The resource based review approach provides new insights into supply chain uncertainty and risk management. This study is dedicated to courier firms. Thus, any generalization to other industries or sectors must be made with caution. Supply chain uncertainty and risk may be affected not only by logistics capabilities, but also by various other variables or capabilities not considered in this study. Further research can be conducted to develop the resource based review approach for managing different supply chain and risk under the different supply chain risk management strategies, and investigate extent of different types of firm capabilities for mitigating supply chain uncertainties and risks. The approach also may be examined respectively in the different sectors by deploying different types of firm capabilities. Furthermore, the research enlightens the logistics participators to rethink the way to manage the supply chain uncertainty and risk in order to achieve superior logistics performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1 Conceptual model</figDesc></figure>
