<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We perform a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for low-dimensionalized complex flow phenomena. We first apply the SINDy with two regression methods, the thresholded least square algorithm and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator which show reasonable ability with a wide range of sparsity constant in our preliminary tests, to a two-dimensional single cylinder wake at Re D = 100, its transient process and a wake of two-parallel cylinders, as examples of high-dimensional fluid data. To handle these high-dimensional data with SINDy whose library matrix is suitable for low-dimensional variable combinations, a convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) is utilized. The CNN-AE is employed to map a high-dimensional dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space. The SINDy then seeks a governing equation of the mapped low-dimensional latent vector. Temporal evolution of high-dimensional dynamics can be provided by combining the predicted latent vector by SINDy with the CNN decoder which can remap the low-dimensional latent vector to the original dimension. The SINDy can provide a stable solution as the governing equation of the latent dynamics and the CNN-SINDy-based modelling can reproduce high-dimensional flow fields successfully, although more terms are required to represent the transient flow and the two-parallel cylinder wake than the periodic shedding. A nine-equation turbulent shear flow model is finally considered to examine the applicability of SINDy to turbulence, although without using CNN-AE.

The SINDy algorithm enables us to discover a governing equation from time-discretized data and identify dominant terms from a large set of potential terms that are likely to be involved in the model. Recently, the usefulness of the SINDy has been demonstrated in various fields <ref type="bibr">(Champion, Brunton &amp; Kutz 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hoffmann, Fröhner &amp; Noé 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zhang &amp; Schaeffer 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deng et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Here, let us introduce some efforts, especially in the fluid dynamics community. <ref type="bibr">Loiseau, Noack &amp; Brunton (2018b)</ref> utilized SINDy to present general reduced-order modelling (ROM) framework for experimental data: sensor data and particle image velocimetry data. The model was investigated using a transient and post-transient laminar cylinder wake. They reported that the nonlinear full-state dynamics can be modelled with sensor-based dynamics and SINDy-based estimation for coefficients of ROM. The SINDy which takes into account control inputs (called SINDYc) was also investigated by <ref type="bibr">Brunton, Proctor &amp; Kutz (2016b)</ref> using the Lorenz equations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Loiseau &amp; Brunton (2018)</ref> combined SINDy and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to enforce energy-preserving physical constraints in the regression procedure toward the development of a new data-driven Galerkin regression framework. For the time-varying aerodynamics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Li et al. (2019)</ref> identified vortex-induced vibrations on a long-span suspension bridge utilizing the SINDy algorithm extended to parametric partial differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rudy et al. 2017)</ref>. As a novel method to perform the order reduction of data and SINDy simultaneously, there is a customized autoencoder (AE) <ref type="bibr">(Champion et al. 2019a</ref>) introducing the SINDy loss in the loss function of deep AE networks. The sparse regression idea has also recently been propagated to turbulence closure modelling purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beetham &amp; Capecelatro 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schmelzer, Dwight &amp; Cinnella 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beetham, Fox &amp; Capecelatro 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Duraisamy 2021</ref>). As reported in these studies, by employing the SINDy to predict the temporal evolution of a system, we can obtain ordinary differential equations, which should be helpful to many applications, e.g. control of a system. In this way, the propagation of the use of SINDy can be seen in the fluid dynamics community.</p><p>We here examine the possibility of SINDy-based modelling of low-dimensionalized complex fluid flows presented in figure 1. Following our preliminary tests with the van der Pol oscillator and the Lorenz attractor presented in the Appendices, we apply the SINDys with two regression methods, (1) thresholded least square algorithm (TLSA) and (2) adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Alasso), to a two-dimensional cylinder wake at Re D = 100, its transient process, and a wake of two-parallel cylinders as examples of high-dimensional dynamics. In this study, a convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) is utilized to handle these high dimensional data with SINDy whose library matrix is suitable for low-dimensional variable combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kaiser, Kutz &amp; Brunton 2018)</ref>. The CNN-AE here is employed to map a high-dimensional dynamics into low-dimensional latent space. The SINDy is then utilized to obtain a governing equation of the mapped low-dimensional latent vector. Unifying the dynamics of the latent vector obtained via SINDy with the CNN decoder which can remap the low-dimensional latent vector to the original dimension, we can present the temporal evolution of high-dimensional dynamics and avoid the issue with high-dimensional variables as discussed above. The scheme of the present ROM is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hasegawa et al. (2019</ref><ref type="bibr">Hasegawa et al. ( , 2020a,b) ,b)</ref> who utilized a long short term memory instead of SINDy in the present ROM framework. The paper is organized as follows. We provide details of SINDy and CNN-AE in § 2. We present the results for high-dimensional flow examples with the CNN-AE/SINDy ROM in § § 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. In § 3.4, we also discuss 926 A10-2 its applicability to turbulence using the nine-equation turbulent shear flow model, although without considering the CNN-AE. At last, concluding remarks with outlook are offered in § 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">CNN-AE</head><p>We use a CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(LeCun et al. 1998</ref>) AE <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hinton &amp; Salakhutdinov 2006)</ref> for order reduction of high-dimensional data, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. As an example, we show the CNN-AE with three hidden layers. In a training process, the AE F is trained to output the same data as the input data q such that q ≈ F(q; w), where w denotes the weights of the machine learning model. The process to optimize the weights w can be formulated as an iterative minimization of an error function E,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">w = argmin w [E(q, F(q; w))].</formula><p>(2.8)</p><p>For the use of the AE as a dimension compressor, the dimension of an intermediate space called the latent space η is smaller than that of the input or output data q as illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. When we are able to obtain the output F(q) similar to the input q such that q ≈ F(q), it can be guaranteed that the latent vector r is a low-dimensional representation of its input or output q. In an AE, the dimension compressor is called the encoder F e (the left-hand part in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and the counterpart is referred to as the decoder F d (the right-hand part in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Using them, the internal procedure of the AE can be expressed as r = F e (q), q = F d (r).</p><p>(2.9a,b)</p><p>In the present study, the dimension of the latent space for the problems of a cylinder wake and its transient process is set to two following our previous work (Murata, Latent vector Fukami &amp; Fukagata 2020). <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Murata et al. (2020)</ref> reported that the flow fields can be mapped into a low-dimensional latent space successfully while keeping the information of high-dimensional flow fields. For the example of a two-parallel cylinder wake in § 3.3, the dimension of the latent space is set to four to handle its quasi-periodicity, accordingly.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">w = argmin w [E(q, F(q; w))] Number of layers Number of filters Channel K L L H H r = F e (q) q = F d (r) F (q) = q( l max) r m q = q (0) q (2)</formula><p>For construction of the AE, the L 2 norm error is applied as the error function E and the Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kingma &amp; Ba 2014)</ref> is utilized for updating the weights in the iterative training process.</p><p>Next, let us briefly explain the convolutional neural network. In the scheme of the convolutional neural network, a filter h, whose size is H × H, is utilized as the weights w, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a). The mathematical expression here is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">q (l) ijm = ψ ⎛ ⎝ K-1 k=0 H-1 p=0 H-1 s=0 h (l) pskm q (l-1) i+p-C,j+s-C,k + b (l) ijm ⎞ ⎠ ,</formula><p>(2.10)</p><p>where C = floor(H/2), q (l) is the output at layer l, and K is the number of variables in the data (e.g. K = 1 for black-and-white photos and K = 3 for RGB images). Although not shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, b is a bias added to the results of the filter operation. The activation function ψ is usually a monotonically increasing nonlinear function. The AE can achieve more effective dimension reduction than the linear theory-based method, i.e. POD <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lumley 1967)</ref>, thanks to the nonlinear activation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Milano &amp; Koumoutsakos 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fukami et al. 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Murata et al. 2020</ref>). In the present study, a hyperbolic tangent function ψ(a) = (e ae -a ) • (e a + e -a ) -1 is adopted for the activation function following <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Murata et al. (2020)</ref>. Moreover, we use the convolutional neural network to construct the AE because the CNN is good at handling high-dimensional data with lower computational costs than fully connected models, i.e. multilayer perceptron, thanks to the filter concept which assumes that pixels of images have no strong relationship with those of far areas. Recently, the use of CNN has emerged to deal with high-dimensional problems including fluid dynamics <ref type="bibr">(Fukami, Fukagata &amp; Taira 2019a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fukami et al. 2019c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fukami, Fukagata &amp; Taira 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fukami et al. 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Omata &amp; Shirayama 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morimoto, Fukami &amp; Fukagata 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fukami, Fukagata &amp; Taira 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Matsuo et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Morimoto et al. 2021)</ref>, although this concept was originally developed in the field of computer science.  The SINDy is then performed to obtain a governing equation of the mapped low-dimensional latent vector. Unifying the predicted latent vector by the SINDy with the CNN decoder, we can obtain the temporal evolution of high-dimensional flow field as presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Moreover, the issue with high-dimensional variables and SINDy can also be avoided. Note again that the present ROM is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hasegawa et al. (2019</ref><ref type="bibr">Hasegawa et al. ( , 2020a,b) ,b)</ref> who capitalized on a long short-term memory instead of SINDy. We apply this framework to a two-dimensional cylinder wake in § 3.1, its transient process in § 3.2 and a wake of two-parallel cylinders in § 3.3. In this study, we perform a fivefold cross-validation <ref type="bibr">(Brunton &amp; Kutz 2019)</ref> to create all machine learning models, although only the results of a single case will be presented, for brevity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Example 1: periodic cylinder wake</head><p>Here, let us consider a two-dimensional cylinder wake using a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS). The governing equations are the incompressible continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∂u ∂t + ∇ • (uu) = -∇p + 1 Re D ∇ 2 u, (3.2)</formula><p>where u and p represent the velocity vector and pressure, respectively. All quantities are made dimensionless by the fluid density, the free stream velocity and the cylinder diameter. The Reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter is Re D = 100. The size of the computational domain is L x = 25.6 and L y = 20.0 in the streamwise (x) and the transverse (y) directions, respectively. The origin of coordinates is defined at the centre of the inflow boundary. A Cartesian grid with the uniform grid spacing of x = y = 0.025 is used; thus, the number of grid points is (N x , N y ) = (1024, 800). We use the ghost cell method <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kor, Badri Ghomizad &amp; Fukagata 2017)</ref> to impose the no-slip boundary condition on the surface of cylinder whose centre is located at (x, y) = (9, 0). In the present study, we utilize the flows around the cylinder as the training data set, i.e. 8.2 ≤ x ≤ 17.8 and -2.4 ≤ y ≤ 2.4 with <ref type="bibr">384,</ref><ref type="bibr">192)</ref>. The fluctuation components of streamwise velocity u and transverse velocity v are considered as the input and output attributes for CNN-AE. The time interval of the flow field data is t = 0.025 corresponding to approximately 230 snapshots per a period with the Strouhal number St = 0.172.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(N * x , N * y ) = (</formula><p>As mentioned above, the SINDy is employed to identify the ordinary differential equations that govern the temporal evolution of the mapped vector obtained by the CNN encoder. The time history and the trajectory of the mapped latent vector r = (r 1 , r 2 ) are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. For the assessment of the candidate models, we integrate the differential equations to reproduce the time history. Note in passing that the indices based on the L 2 error are not suitable since the slight difference between the period of reproduced oscillation and that of original one results in large L 2 errors for oscillating systems. We here use the amplitude and the frequency of oscillation to evaluate the similarity between the reproduced waveform and the original one. Hereafter, the error rate of the amplitude and the frequency are shown in the figures below for simplicity. The number of terms is also considered for the parsimonious model selection.</p><p>We consider two regression methods for SINDy, i.e. TLSA and Alasso, following our previous tests. Let us present the results of parameter search utilizing TLSA in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Note here that we use 10 000 mapped vectors for the construction of a SINDy model.   Using α = 1, the reproduced trajectory is in excellent agreement with the original one. However, there are many terms in the ordinary differential equations and some coefficients are too large, although the oscillation are presented with a shallow range (-1, 1). The result with the TLSA here is likely because we do not use the data processing, which causes the large regression coefficients and non-sparse results. On the other hand, the reproduced trajectory with α = 10 converges to a point around (r 1 , r 2 ) = (0.6, 0), although the model SINDy with low-dimensionalized flow representations becomes parsimonious. Since the predicted latent vector converges after t ≈ 4 as shown in the time history of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the temporal evolution of the flow field by the CNN decoder is also frozen, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. Other observation here is that there remains no terms in the ordinary differential equations with high threshold, i.e. α ≥ 50.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">t = 2 α = 1 α = 10 DNS t = 4 t = 6 (a) (d) ( e) ( f ) (g) (h) (i) (b) ( c)</formula><p>With Alasso as the regression method, we can find the candidate models with low errors at α = 2 × 10 -5 and 1 × 10 -4 , as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. At α = 2 × 10 -5 , the ordinary differential equations consist of four coefficients in total and the reproduced trajectory gradually converges as shown. On the other hand, by choosing the appropriate sparsity constant, i.e. α = 1 × 10 -4 , the circle-like oscillating trajectory, which is similar to the reference, can be represented with only two terms. We then check the reproduced flow field by the combination of the predicted latent vector by SINDy and CNN decoder, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The temporal evolution of high-dimensional dynamics can be reproduced well using the proposed model, although the period of the two fields are slightly different.</p><p>The quantitative analysis with the probability density function, the mean streamwise velocity at y = 0, and the time history of ERR is summarized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. The ERR R is defined as In other words, the obtained equation can be integrated stably. The success of the CNN-SINDy-based modelling can be also seen with time-averaged velocity and energy containing rate in figure 10. For SINDy, we use the data with t = [60, 160]. The library matrix contains up to fifth-order terms. Although equations, which can provide the correct temporal evolution of the latent vector, can be obtained with Alasso by including higher-order terms, the model here is, of course, not sparse and so difficult to interpret.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R = S (u 2 Rep + v 2 Rep ) dS S (u 2 DNS + v 2 DNS ) dS , (<label>3</label></formula></div>

Unlike the wake dynamics of two identical circular cylinders as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kang (2003)</ref>, the coupled wakes behind two side-by-side uneven cylinders exhibits more complex vortex interactions, due to the mismatch in their individual shedding frequencies.   Training flow snapshots are prepared with a DNS with the open-source computational fluid dynamics (known as CFD) toolbox OpenFOAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Weller et al. 1998)</ref>, using second-order discretization schemes in both time and space. We arrange the two circular cylinders with a size ratio of r and a gap of gD, where g is the gap ratio and D is the diameter of the lower cylinder. The Reynolds number is fixed at Re D = 100. The two cylinders are placed 20D downstream of the inlet where a uniform flow with velocity U ∞ is prescribed, and 40D upstream of the outlet with zero pressure. The side boundaries are specified as slip and are 40D apart. The time steps for the DNS and the snapshot sampling are, respectively, 0.01 and 0.1. A notable feature of wakes associated with the present two-cylinder position is complex wake behaviour caused by varying the size ratio r and the gap ratio g <ref type="bibr">(Morimoto et al. 2020b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Morimoto et al. , 2021))</ref>. In the present study, the wake with the combination of {r, g} = {1.15, 2.0}, which is a quasi-periodic in time, is considered for the demonstration. For the training of both the CNN-AE and the SINDy, we use 2000 snapshots.

We here construct AEs with two n r cases: n r = 3 and n r = 4. As presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>(a), the recovered flow fields through the AE-based low-dimensionalization are in reasonable agreement with the reference DNS snapshots. Quantitatively speaking, the L 2 error norms between the reference and the decoded fields are approximately 14 % and 5 % for each case. Although both models achieve the smooth spatial reconstruction, we can find the significant difference by focusing on their temporal behaviours in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15(b)</ref>. While the time trace with n r = 4 shows smooth variations for all four variables, the curves with n r = 3 exhibit a shaky behaviour despite the quasi-periodic nature of the flow. This is caused by the higher error level of the n r = 3 case. Furthermore, it is also known that a high-error level due to an overcompression via Let us perform SINDy with TLSA and Alasso for the AE latent variables with n r = 4. For the construction of a library matrix of this example, we include up to third-order terms in terms of four latent variables. The relationship between the sparsity constant α and the number of terms in identified equations is examined in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>. Similarly to the previous two examples with a single cylinder, the trends for TLSA and Alasso are different from each other. Note that one can only refer to this map to check the sparsity trend of the identified equation, since there is no model equation. To validate the fidelity of the equations, we need to integrate identified equations and decode a flow field using the decoder part of AE.</p><p>The identified equations via the TLSA-based SINDy are investigated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref>. As examples, the cases with α = 0.1 and 0.5 are shown. The case with α = 1 which contains nonlinear terms shows a diverging behaviour at t ≈ 90. The sparse equation obtained with α = 0.5 can provide stable solutions for r 1 and r 2 ; however, its sparseness causes the unstable integration for r 3 and r 4 . Note in passing that the TLSA-based modelling cannot identify the stable solution although we have carefully examined the influence on the sparsity factors for other cases not shown here.</p><p>We then use Alasso as a regression function of SINDy, as summarized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref>. The cases with α = 5 × 10 -7 and 10 -6 are shown. The identified equation with α = 5 × 10 -7 can successfully be integrated and its temporal behaviour is in good agreement with the reference curve provided by the AE-based latent variables. However, what is notable here is that the equation with α = 10 -6 shows the decaying behaviour with an increasing of the integration window despite the equation form being very similar to the case with α = 5 × 10 -7 . Some nonlinear terms are eliminated due to the slight increase in the sparsity constant. These results indicate the importance of the careful choice for both regression functions and the sparsity constants associated with them.</p><p>Based on the results above, the integrated variables with the case of Alasso with α = 5 × 10 -7 are fed into the CNN decoder, as presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">19</ref>.

In addition, the number of terms in a coefficient matrix must be drastically increased for the turbulent case unless the flow can be expressed with a smaller number of modes.

Since the equations for the temporal coefficients are constructed up to second-order terms, the coefficient matrix also includes up to second-order terms, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21(a)</ref>. The total number of terms considered here is 55. The results with TLSA and Alasso are summarized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21(b</ref>). The matrices located in the right-hand area correspond to the coefficient matrix in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21(a)</ref>. Similar to the results above, the model using TLSA has some huge values due to a lack of penalty terms. Especially, the effects by overfitting can be seen for the low-order portion. On the other hand, the remarkable ability of the SINDy can be seen with the Alasso. By giving the appropriate sparsity constant α, the governing equations can be represented successfully. The details of each magnitude of the coefficients are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">22</ref>. It is striking that the dominant terms are perfectly captured by using SINDy, although the magnitudes are slightly different.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We performed a SINDy for low-dimensionalized fluid flows and investigated influences of the regression methods and parameter considered for construction of SINDy-based modelling. Following our preliminary test, the SINDys with two regression methods, the TLSA and the Alasso, were applied to the examples of a wake around a cylinder, its transient process, and a wake of two-parallel cylinders, with a CNN-AE. The CNN-AE was employed to map high-dimensional flow data into a two-dimensional latent space using nonlinear functions. Temporal evolution of the latent dynamics could be followed well by using SINDy with an appropriate parameter selection for both examples, although the required number of terms for the coefficient matrix are varied with each other due to the difference in complexity. Finally, we also investigated the applicability of SINDy to turbulence with low-dimensional representation using a nine-shear flow model. The governing equation could be obtained successfully by utilizing Alasso with the appropriate sparsity constant. The results indicated that ML-ROM for turbulent flows can be perhaps presented in the interpretable sense in the form of an equation, if a well-designed model for mapping high-dimensional complex flows into low-dimensional manifolds can be constructed. With regard to the low-dimensional manifolds of fluid flows, the novel work by <ref type="bibr">Loiseau et al. (2018a)</ref> discussed the nonlinear relationship between lower-order POD modes and higher-order counterparts of cylinder wake dynamics by relating it to a triadic interaction among POD modes. We may be able to borrow the concept here to investigate the possible nonlinear correlations in the data, although it will be tackled in the future since it is not easy to apply their idea directly to the nine-equation shear flow model which is composed of more complex relationships among modes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5:</head><p>Assess the candidate model with an evaluation index 6: end for 7: Choose the best model by the assessment 8: Model is identified. in algorithm 3, number of total remaining terms of the obtained equation are utilized as the evaluation index for the preliminary test. For cylinder examples, the number of total terms, the error in the amplitudes of obtained waveforms, and the error ratio in the period between the obtained wave and the solution are assessed. we will investigate the dependence of SINDy performance on both the length of time step and the length of training data range later. The library matrix is arranged including up to the fifth-order terms. In this example, we assess candidate models by using the total number of terms contained in the obtained ordinary differential equation. As denoted in (B1) and (B2), the true model has four non-zero terms in total in two governing equations. The relationship between the total number of terms in the candidate models and α is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">25</ref>. As shown, the uses of Lasso and Enet cannot reach the true model whose total number of terms is four. On the other hand, using TLSA or Alasso, the correct governing equation can be identified. It is striking that we should choose the appropriate parameter α for the correct model identification, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">25</ref>. In this sense, the Alasso is suitable for the problem here since a wide range of α, i.e. 10 -9 ≤ α ≤ 10 -2 , can provide the correct equation. The difference here is likely due to the scheme of each regression.</p><p>The TLSA is unable to discard the components of β with low α values: in other words, a lot of terms remain through the iterative process. On the other hand, the Alasso can identify the dominant terms clearly thanks to adaptive weights even if α is relatively low.</p><p>To investigate the dependence on the time step of the input data, SINDy is performed on the data with different time steps: t = 1 × 10 -2 , 0.1 and 0.2. Here, we consider only TLSA and Alasso following the aforementioned results. Note that the number of input data is different due to the time step since the integration time length is fixed to t max = 200 in all cases. We have checked in our preliminary tests that this difference has no significant effect on the results. The trajectory, the results for the parameter search, and the example of obtained equations are summarized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">26</ref>. With the fine data, i.e. t = 1 × 10 -2 , the governing equations are correctly identified with some α for both methods. The true model can be found even if we use very small α, i.e. α = 1 × 10 -8 with Alasso as mentioned before. With increasing t, i.e. t = 0.1, the coefficients of terms are slightly underestimated. Additionally, the range of α where the number of terms is around α = 1 × 10 -8 . The time length has little effect on the model identification if the time length is more than one period. For considering models in which higher-order terms may be dominant due to higher nonlinearity, it will be valuable to find the way to select the appropriate potential terms that should be included in the library matrix. From this view, the dependence on the number of potential terms is investigated using the data with t = 1 × 10 -2 . In the case where the maximum order of the potential terms is the fifth, the true model can be found with two regression methods, i.e. TLSA and Alasso, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">26(a)</ref>. Here, the case with higher maximum order, i.e. the 15th and 20th, are also investigated as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">28</ref>. Note that there are 136 and 231 potential terms for each differential equation in these cases. For both cases with a different number of potential terms, we cannot find the true model with TLSA while the true model is identified in a wide range of α with Alasso. Furthermore, in the case including up to the 15th terms, some coefficients in the equation obtained by TLSA become huge. These large coefficients are due to the different functions included in the library being almost collinear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2. Pretest 2: Lorenz attractor</head><p>As the second preliminary test, we consider the problem of identifying a chaotic trajectory called the Lorenz attractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lorenz 1963)</ref> As with the preliminary test of the van der Pol oscillator, we consider four regression methods: TLSA, Lasso, Enet and Alasso, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">30</ref>. Note that 10 000 discretized points with t = 1 × 10 -2 from the time range of t = [0, 100] are used as the training data and the potential terms up to fifth order are considered here. Similar to the van der Pol oscillator, we can obtain the true model whose total number of terms is seven with TLSA or Alasso, although Lasso or Enet cannot identify the equation correctly.</p><p>Comparing the two methods which can obtain the correct model, the range of α, where the governing equations are identified, is wider using Alasso. We also perform SINDy with different time steps as shown in figure 31. Note that the considered time range is not changed depending on the time steps: in other words, the number of training data is changed per a considered time step, which is the same setting as that for the van der  Pol example. Similarly to the case of the van der Pol oscillator, we cannot reach the correct model using TLSA unless α is fine-tuned, and the coefficients are underestimated using Alasso with the wider time step data, i.e. t = 2 × 10 -2 . Moreover, the dependence on how many orders are considered in the library matrix is investigated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">32</ref>. There are 286 or 816 potential terms for each differential equation with the case including up to the 10th-or 15th-order terms, respectively. Analogous to the van der Pol oscillator example, the true model cannot be identified with TLSA; however, we can identify the true equation using Alasso even if there are as many as 816 potential terms with an appropriate range of α. Based on these results, TLSA and Alasso are selected as candidate regressions for high-dimensional complex flow problems.</p><p>In addition, we here note that the use of simple data processing (e.g. the standardization and the normalization) for both AE and SINDy pipelines may help Lasso and Enet to improve the regression ability, although it highly relies on a problem setting. Taking the data processing usually limits the model for practical uses because these data processing can only be successfully employed when we can guarantee an ergodicity, i.e. the statistical features of training data and test data are common with each other <ref type="bibr">(Guastoni et al. 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morimoto et al. 2020b</ref>). When we perform the data processing, an inverse transformation error through the normalization or standardization is usually added since parameters for x = 0.17 the processing, e.g. minimum value, maximum value, average value and variance, may be changed over the training and test phases. Hence, toward practical applications, it is better to prepare the regression method which is robust for the amplitudes of data oscillations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
