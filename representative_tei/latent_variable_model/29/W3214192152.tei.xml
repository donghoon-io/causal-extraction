<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is well documented that energy balance and other remote sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) models face greater uncertainty over water-limited tree-grass ecosystems (TGEs), representing nearly 1/6 th of the global land surface. Their dual vegetation strata, the grass dominated understory and tree dominated overstory, make for distinct structural, physiological and phenological characteristics, which challenge models compared to more homogeneous and energy-limited ecosystems. Along with this, the contribution of grasses and trees to total transpiration (T), along with their different climatic drivers, is still largely unknown nor quantified in TGEs. This study proposes a thermal-based three-source energy balance (3SEB) model, accommodating an additional vegetation source within the well-known two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. The model was implemented at both tower and continental scales using eddy-covariance (EC) TGE sites, with variable tree canopy cover and rainfall (P) regimes, and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) images. 3SEB robustly simulated latent heat (LE) and related energy fluxes in all sites (Tower: LE RMSD ~ 60 W/m 2 ; MSG: LE RMSD ~ 90 W/m 2 ), improving over both TSEB and a seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S) models. In addition, 3SEB inherently partitions water fluxes between the tree, grass and soil sources. The modelled T correlated well with EC T estimates (r &gt; 0.76), derived from a machine learning ET partitioning method. The T/ET was found positively related to both P and leaf area index, especially compared to the decomposed grass understory T/ET. However, tree and grasses had contrasting relations with respect to monthly P. These results demonstrate the importance in decomposing total ET into the different vegetation sources, as they have distinct climatic drivers, and hence, different relations to seasonal water availability. These promising results improved ET and energy flux estimations over complex TGEs, which may contribute to enhance drought monitoring and understanding, and their responses to climate change feedbacks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Climate models project semi-arid tree-grass ecosystems (TGEs), such as savannas, to be disproportionately sensitive to global land and climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bond et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sala et al., 2000)</ref>. Along with this, long-term water, carbon and energy flux data are notably less available in arid and semi-arid ecosystems compared to humid or mesic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Biederman et al., 2017)</ref>. Remote sensing (RS) and modeling alleviate the relative lack of data however, these are often poorly constrained and/or do not sufficiently represent their more complex heterogeneous features <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Whitley et al., 2017)</ref>. By contrast, global and regional-scale studies highlighted the dominant role that TGEs and other semi-arid ecosystems play on the global biogeochemical cycle, being the main contributor to the trend and inter-annual variability of global carbon and water fluxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahlström et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Poulter et al., 2014)</ref>. These regions are largely water-limited, as opposed to the energy limited, and have unique seasonal and phenological characteristics that are much more coupled to water availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baldocchi and Xu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Higgins et al., 2011)</ref>. As climate change scenarios predict increases in drought frequency and severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Sheffield and Wood, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wang, 2005)</ref>, an improved understanding of these TGEs is critical to not only better manage their limited hydrological resources, but also due to their important links with the global carbon cycle.</p><p>Evapotranspiration (ET), the combination of the abiotically driven surface evaporation and biotic transpiration of vegetation, is an important proxy to determine drought events (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">González-Dugo et al., 2021)</ref>. It is a major flux of the water cycle, often more than 90% of incoming annual precipitation (P) in semi-arid catchments <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(García et al., 2013)</ref>, and of the surface energy balance (SEB) as latent heat flux (LE). Eddy-covariance (EC) flux tower networks such as FLUXNET <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baldocchi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Running et al., 1999)</ref> provide LE observations at numerous sites worldwide. Although the prevalent lack of energy balance closure (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Stoy et al., 2013)</ref> is generally attributed, at least partly, to an underestimation of LE <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Foken et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Leuning et al., 2012)</ref>. Since EC measurements only offer information over a footprint of several hundred meters, RS is the most feasible source to obtain spatially distributed global and regional ET estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Glenn et al., 2007)</ref>. Among them, SEB models find a good compromise between being physically-based, but without needing extensive data inputs nor parameters to constrain them <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kustas and Anderson, 2009)</ref>. For this reason, regional and global ET products widely use SEB models <ref type="bibr">(Allen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anderson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guzinski et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Senay et al., 2013)</ref>. These models compute ET as the residual of the energy balance, where the available energy (AE), the difference between net radiation (Rn) and ground heat flux (G), is partitioned between sensible heat (H) and LE fluxes. SEB modeling exploits the thermal infrared region (TIR; 8-14 µm) to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST), using it as the main boundary condition to give a proxy on root-zone soil moisture and vegetation status.</p><p>There are several types of thermal-based SEB models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bastiaanssen, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Norman et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Su, 2002)</ref>. They largely differ in how they address the difference between the radiometric (LST) and aerodynamic temperature (T0). 'Single-source' models treat the surface as a single composite layer and may use an additional excess resistance term <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lhomme et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Verhoef et al., 1997)</ref> and/or apply a local calibration procedure that is constrained by end-member pixels (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bastiaanssen, 2000)</ref>. However, these adjustments are often highly parameterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Boulet et al., 2015)</ref>, need local calibration <ref type="bibr">(Kustas et al. 2016)</ref> or rely on certain assumptions being met at the area of interest. A 'dual-source' approach instead decouples the surface temperature and energy exchange into vegetation and soil components, considering the directional effects of the TIR sensor observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Boulet et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Norman et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Norman et al., , 1995))</ref>. This more physically based formulation avoids the need for large empirical adjustments, and more adequately represents sparse vegetation cover, common in semi-arid ecosystems. The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kustas and Norman, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Norman et al., 1995)</ref> has been robustly applied in diverse landscapes, including for water stressed conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guzinski et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kustas et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Timmermans et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>However, ET models show limitations in more structurally complex landscapes, such as TGEs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Andreu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burchard-Levine et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cleugh et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Majozi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Ramoelo et al., 2014)</ref>. TGEs represent about 1/6 th of the Earth's surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Sulla-Menashe et al., 2019)</ref> and are a prominent land cover within semi-arid regions. Their scattered (or open) tree overstory superimposing a continuous herbaceous understory have very different structural and phenological characteristics. These features, combined with the complex non-linear relationship between model parameters and flux output, causes for greater model uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Burchard-Levine et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, 2020)</ref>. To improve ET simulations through a two-source perspective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burchard-Levine et al. (2020)</ref> proposed a seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S) to accommodate the contrasting phenology of trees and grasses. In a similar Mediterranean TGE, Andreu et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) calibrated the initial potential transpiration estimate in TSEB and adjusted the wind profile scheme to incorporate the effects of both the overstory and understory on wind turbulence. However, while these adjustments improved the flux estimations in TGEs, they do not directly account for the effect of the dual vegetation layer, limiting their applicability to other TGE sites.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a remote sensing based three-source energy balance (3SEB) model, integrating the tree-grass-soil layers present in TGEs within its model structure. The inherent decoupling of fluxes across these layers seeks to improve the understanding of transpiration (T) and plant water use efficiency, along with their relation to water availability and climate change. This also provides a framework to quantify the different tree and grass contribution to T, with currently very little available knowledge in this respect, especially at the ecosystem scale. EC measurements benchmarked 3SEB at four TGE sites located in Australia, Spain (2) and USA. The natural gradient between sites including large variability in tree cover (19 to 48%), climate (annual rainfall (P): 300 to 850 mm/y) and physiology (evergreen vs deciduous trees) required examining the T/ET relation with P and the leaf area index (LAI). In addition, TSEB <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Norman et al., 1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">TSEB-2S (Burchard-Levine et al., 2020)</ref> simulations were evaluated against 3SEB. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, 3SEB was implemented at quasi-global scale using data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites. The model outputs were produced for TGE pixels within the MSG extent (~Africa, Europe and parts of Asia and South America) and evaluated over three EC sites in Spain, Senegal and South Africa.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Three-source energy balance (3SEB) model structure</head><p>The 3SEB model structure is based on the TSEB <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Norman et al., 1995)</ref> surface resistance and energy balance equations. 3SEB adds a vegetation layer to the TSEB model scheme to account for the dual vegetation layers. The original TSEB formulation presented both the 'series' and 'parallel' formulations to describe the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Norman et al., 1995)</ref>. The 'parallel' approach portrays no interaction between the soil/substrate and vegetation components, with both components interacting directly with the atmosphere. By contrast, the 'series' formulation assumes interaction between the two sources with both contributing to the temperature in the canopy air space (i.e., aerodynamic temperature) <ref type="bibr">(Kustas and Norman, 1999b)</ref>.</p><p>The 'parallel' model should not be confused with the 'patch' model as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lhomme et al. (2012)</ref>, where the surface is portrayed as 'patches' of vegetation and soil/substrate that are fully uncoupled and act independently of each other <ref type="bibr">(Kustas and Norman, 1999b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lhomme et al., 2012)</ref>. Within the 'parallel' resistance framework, the vegetation source still has an influence on the wind speed attenuation below the canopy, and the radiation transmitting through canopy towards the soil surface <ref type="bibr">(Kustas and Norman, 1999b)</ref>. A combined 'parallel-series' three-source modeling approach is proposed here (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑇 𝑠𝑢𝑏 = [𝑓 (𝜃),𝑢𝑛 𝑇 𝑢𝑛 4 + (1 -𝑓 (𝜃),𝑢𝑛 )𝑇 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 4 ] 1 4 ⁄ (1.2)</formula><p>where 𝑇 𝑠𝑢𝑏 is the understory vegetation + soil substrate (sub) temperature (K); 𝑓 (𝜃),𝑐 is the fraction of vegetation (c for either understory, un, or overstory, ov) observed by the sensor and estimated as: 𝑓 (𝜃),𝑐 = 1 -𝑒𝑥𝑝(-𝑘 𝑏𝑐 𝛺 𝑐 𝐹 𝑐 ), where F is the local LAI (m 2 /m 2 ), 𝛺 is the clumping index (-), and 𝑘 𝑏 is the beam extinction coefficient described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Campbell and Norman (1998)</ref>. Section S2 in supplementary material (SI) describes 𝛺 and 𝑘 𝑏 estimations. Using this approach, the energy balance is decoupled between the three sources:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝐿𝐸 𝑜𝑣 = 𝑅𝑛 𝑜𝑣 -𝐻 𝑜𝑣 (2.1) 𝐿𝐸 𝑢𝑛 = 𝑅𝑛 𝑢𝑛 -𝐻 𝑢𝑛 (2.2) 𝐿𝐸 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 = 𝑅𝑛 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 -𝐻 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 -𝐺 (2.3)</formula><p>where LE is latent heat flux (W m -2 ) and G is the soil heat flux (W m -2 ). Using the layer approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lhomme et al. 2012)</ref>, the fluxes of each source sum up to obtain the total bulk surface flux (i.e., 𝐹𝑙 = 𝐹𝑙 𝑜𝑣 + 𝐹𝑙 𝑢𝑛 + 𝐹𝑙 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 , where 𝐹𝑙 represents the energy fluxes, either Rn, LE or H). The radiative transfer model (RTM) described in Chapter 15 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Campbell and Norman (1998)</ref>, which was slightly adapted to consider multiple vegetation layers (see section S2 in SI), simulated the radiation transmission through the canopies. G is estimated through the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Santanello and Friedl (2003)</ref>. To solve the system of equations, a two-step approach is applied. Firstly, the surface is treated as a parallel (i.e., uncoupled) tree-substrate system to obtain 𝐻 𝑜𝑣 and 𝐻 𝑠𝑢𝑏 using the heat transport equation (Eq. 3.1, 3.2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐻 𝑜𝑣 = 𝜌𝐶 𝑝 (𝑇 𝑜𝑣 -𝑇 𝐴 ) 𝑅 𝐴 (3.1) 𝐻 𝑠𝑢𝑏 = 𝜌𝐶 𝑝 (𝑇 𝑠𝑢𝑏 -𝑇 𝐴 ) 𝑅 𝐴 +𝑅 𝑠𝑢𝑏 (3.2)</formula><p>where 𝜌𝐶 𝑝 is the volumetric heat capacity of air (J m -3 K -1 ); 𝑅 𝐴 is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (Eq. S9 in SI) and 𝑅 𝑆𝑢𝑏 is the resistance to heat transfer in the surface boundary layer above substrate layer (s m -1 ) (Eq. S10 in SI). Subsequently, 𝐻 𝑢𝑛 and 𝐻 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 are estimated through a series (i.e., coupled) approach (Eq. 4. where 𝑇 𝐴𝐶 is the air temperature in the canopy space (K) and is equivalent to the aerodynamic temperature; 𝑅 𝑋 is the bulk canopy resistance to heat transfer (s m -1 ; Eq. S11) and 𝑅 𝑆 is the resistance to heat transfer in the boundary layer above soil layer (s m -1 ; Eq. S10). Eq. 3.2 is inverted to estimate 𝑇 𝑠𝑢𝑏 , which serves as the boundary condition to derive 𝑇 𝑢𝑛 and 𝑇 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 in Eq. 1.2. The three-source resistance scheme in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is based on the resistance formulation described in Appendix B of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Norman et al. (1995)</ref>.</p><p>Since 𝑇 𝑜𝑣 , 𝑇 𝑢𝑛 and 𝑇 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 are unknown a priori, the Priestley-Taylor (PT) formulation, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Norman et al. (1995)</ref>, computes a first estimate of the canopy LE and H for both overstory and understory using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝐿𝐸 𝑐 = 𝛼 𝑃𝑇 𝑓 𝑔 ( ∆ ∆ + 𝛾 ) 𝑅𝑛 𝑐</formula><p>(5.1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝐻 𝑐 = 𝑅𝑛 𝑐 -𝐿𝐸 𝑐 = 𝑅𝑛 𝑐 [1 -𝛼 𝑃𝑇 𝑓 𝑔,𝑐 ( ∆ ∆ + 𝛾 )] (5.2)</formula><p>where 𝐿𝐸 𝑐 is the initial canopy transpiration estimate (W m -2 ); 𝛼 𝑃𝑇 is the PT coefficient (default is 1.26) (-), defined in this case only for the vegetation canopy component <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agam et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kustas and Anderson, 2009)</ref>; 𝑓 𝑔,𝑐 is the green vegetation fraction and hence actively transpiring (-); ∆ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa K -1 ) at air temperature (TA); and γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa K -1 ). The subscript c here refers to the understory or overstory vegetation component.</p><p>The PT formulation initializes the model to solve the system of equations. However, this assumes the canopy is transpiring at a potential rate (without water stress). While the vegetation canopy behaves more conservatively compared to the bulk surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agam et al., 2010)</ref>, if the plant is stressed, the PT equation overestimates LE at the canopy level, underestimating the canopy temperature. This induces an overestimation of soil and substrate temperatures and, thus, 𝐻 𝑠𝑢𝑏/𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 to conserve the total surface temperature (Eq. 1.1-1.2). As such, to preserve the energy balance (Eq. 2.1-2.3), this would produce a negative soil or substrate LE (i.e., condensation), which is considered unrealistic for daytime conditions. Therefore, an iteration procedure reduces 𝛼 𝑃𝑇 to mimic water stress until there is conservation in the radiometric and energy balance under feasible bounds (i.e., non-negative daytime component LE). 3SEB implements this procedure separately for the overstory-substrate and the understory-soil systems, since it is expected that each vegetation layer experiences water stress differently, both in terms of magnitude and timing. As such, the understory-soil layer applies the PT formulation considering 𝑇 𝑠𝑢𝑏 as the main boundary condition (Eq. 1.2 and 3.2). The overstory-substrate uses LST as the main boundary condition (Eq. 1.1 and 3.1). Refer to the model source code for further details (<ref type="url" target="https://github.com/VicenteBurchard/3SEB">https://github.com/VicenteBurchard/3SEB</ref>).</p><p>A combination of proximal and satellite RS data forced the 3SEB model. All sites collected half-hourly proximal TIR measurements. This approach is more efficient than daily or bi-weekly satellite near-noon overpasses, since the later does not capture the entire temporal and seasonal dimension and requires clear-sky conditions. However, the model implementation would essentially be the same using spatially discrete LST imagery (see section 2.4). LAI is another important variable that dictates the radiation transmission between the various layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Campbell and Norman, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">section S1 in SI)</ref>. It also characterizes the roughness and aerodynamic resistance of the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Norman et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">section S2 in SI)</ref>. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms retrieved LAI and 𝑓 𝑔 , key for the initial transpiration estimate (Eq. 5.1, 5.2). Section 2.3 describes details on LST, LAI and 𝑓 𝑔 retrievals. In addition, the respective sites collected meteorological data to characterize the turbulent and atmospheric condition (section 2.2). Other auxiliary inputs included the vegetation structure (height, cover and leaf width) (section 2.4) and parameters related to the resistance and radiation transfer sub-models (section S1 and S2 in SI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Study sites</head><p>Four experimental TGE EC sites across three continents evaluated the 3SEB model: Majadas de Tiétar (ES-LM1) and Albuera (ES-Abr) in Spain, the Tonzi Ranch in California, USA (US-Ton) and Dry River in Australia (AU-Dry) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). At all sites, P is mostly concentrated during specific wet seasons and suffer a sustained seasonal drought period. The wet season largely falls during autumn (~October-November) and spring (~March-April), except for AU-Dry (~December-February). Sites vary in P and LAI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), from the relatively arid ES-Abr (P ~300 mm/year) with large seasonal range in LAI (~0.4-2 m 2 /m 2 ) to the more humid AU-Dry (P ~850 mm/year), with comparatively less range in LAI (~0.8-1.8 m 2 /m 2 ). The peak biomass period occurs in ~April-May, but slightly earlier for AU-Dry in ~February-March (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The dry season occurs for all sites roughly in ~June-August, when most of the understory herbaceous species largely senesce. Distinct tree overstory and grass understory compose all TGE sites with variable vegetation composition and density. ES-LM1 is a managed agro-forested area in central Spain, known as dehesa <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(El-Madany et al., 2018)</ref>, where evergreen Holm Oak (Quercus ilex. L.) represents roughly 20% of the surface and stands at a mean height of 8.7 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bogdanovich et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">El-Madany et al., 2020)</ref>. At ~200 km south, ES-Abr is a more arid dehesa also composed of Holm Oaks, but with slightly larger tree fractional cover (24%) and lower canopy height (6.6m) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(El-Madany et al., 2020)</ref>. Deciduous Blue Oaks (Quercus douglasii H. &amp; A) dominate the overstory with a larger 48% cover at the US-Ton site, an oak savanna woodland located on the lower foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baldocchi et al., 2010)</ref>. Evergreen eucalyptus species (Eucalyptus tetrodonta F.Muell, Eucalyptus terminalis F.Muell and Eucalyptus dichromophloia F.Muell) standing at 12.3 m mean height dominate in AU-Dry, with roughly 25% cover <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hutley et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sea et al., 2011)</ref>. All four EC sites have similar instrumentation to force and evaluate 3SEB, including threedimensional sonic anemometer (Gill LTD<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , Lymington, UK), along with infrared gas analyzers <ref type="bibr">(Li-Cor Inc.</ref>, Lincoln, NE, USA) and four-component net radiometers (CNR4, Kipp and Zonen, Delft, Netherlands). Refer to the respective reference of each site for more details (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>). Halfhourly meteorological and flux data were downloaded for the four-year simulation period shown in Fig 3 and listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>, using hydrological years (1-Oct to 30-Sept) to fully capture the main wet and growing seasons. These include incoming shortwave (SWin) and longwave (LWin) irradiance, outgoing longwave irradiance (LWout), TA, relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (u). Additionally, in-situ energy balance observations of Rn, LE, H and G benchmarked the model performance. Allocating residuals to the observed LE ensured the energy balance closure (i.e., ∑[𝐿𝐸 + 𝐻] / ∑[𝑅 𝑁 -𝐺]), which ranged from 0.76 and 0.83 across sites, with the assumption that errors in LE are larger than H (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Foken et al., 2011)</ref>, as applied in similar studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burchard-Levine et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Guzinski et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kustas et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to these four sites, two other EC sites were also used to benchmark the 3SEB model when applied at the continental scale (see section 2.3.3).

The MODIS LAI v006 (MCD15A3H) product provided green LAI (LAIgreen) at 500 m spatial resolution (LAIMODIS). Because the non-green or non-photosynthetically active vegetation (i.e. dead leaves/plants or wooded material) influence the aerodynamic and radiative transfer, total LAI (LAItotal) or plant area index (PAI) would be more appropriate but it is not available globally. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gutman and Ignatov (1998)</ref>  EC measurements benchmarked 3SEB flux outputs (H, LE, Rn and G) at both half-hourly and daily scales. Additionally, 3SEB ET partitioning (T/ET) was evaluated against the Transpiration Estimation Algorithm (TEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Nelson et al., 2018)</ref>. TEA is a data-driven method, which uses the carbon (i.e., gross primary production, GPP) and water (i.e., ET) relations to decouple the T signal from ET.

Since TSEB has only one vegetation source assumed in the model structure, effective input and parameter values depict the mixed surface (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). TSEB-2S adjusts the parameterization of the vegetation source depending on the assumed dominant vegetation source, a grass dominated (understory-soil system) growing phase and a tree-dominated (overstory-soil) drought phase.

TSEB-2S applies the 'understory' or 'overstory' configuration depending on the phenological phase (section S5 in SI). To clarify, 𝑓 𝑐 is different to 𝑓 (𝜃),𝑜𝑣 and 𝑓 (𝜃),𝑢𝑛 from Eq. 1.1 and 1.2. The 𝑓 𝑐 mostly characterizes the distribution and canopy clumping (Eq. S4.1), while 𝑓 (𝜃),𝑜𝑣 and 𝑓 (𝜃),𝑢𝑛 , functions of LAI and sensor viewing angle, are the vegetation fraction viewed by the sensor and partitions the temperature contribution from the different sources. For example, the understory 𝑓 𝑐 (i.e., 𝑓 𝑐,𝑢𝑛 ) is maintained constant at 1 throughout the simulation period, since the understory rather homogeneously covers the entire soil surface, even during the dry period (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). Nevertheless, 𝑓 𝑔 quantifies the vegetation percentage that is photosynthetically active and, by contrast, varies seasonally (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baldocchi and Ma, 2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Vegetation biophysical inputs</head><p>In ES-LM1, the MODIS-derived LAIun correlated well with both in-situ LAItotal (r = 0.71) and LAIgreen (r = 0.83) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). However, moderate errors were observed, notably compared against LAItotal (RMSD = 0.59 m 2 /m 2 ). LAIun was systematically lower compared to LAItotal (bias = -0.45 m 2 /m 2 ), notably during the March-May 2016 peak biomass (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>). Nevertheless, LAIun was generally aligned with LAIgreen (RMSE = 0.32 m 2 /m 2 and bias = -0.08 m 2 /m 2 ). In ES-LM1, as field sampling protocols separated green and non-green material, the fg,un was also assessed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). The retrieved fg,un aligned reasonably well with in-situ measurements in ES-LM1, being well correlated (r = 0.6) and capturing the magnitudes (bias = -0.05 m 2 /m 2 ). Despite this, modeled fg,un had moderate errors (RMSE = 0.22) and a quicker dry down compared to observed values, which sustained peak values for longer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). In US-Ton, the retrieved LAIun were within similar magnitudes to the observed understory LAI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).

LE3SEB RMSD ranged between 59 and 67 W/m 2 . Errors and bias were generally larger in ES-Abr and US-Ton due to the slight underestimation of H (bias = -38 and -36 W/m 2 , respectively). By contrast, H3SEB was slightly overestimated in AU-Dry (bias = 26 W/m 2 ). For all sites, the NSE was greater than 0.5, which indicated a satisfactory model fit compared to observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Moriasi et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The ET3SEB RMSD ranged between 0.35 and 0.48 mm/day (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).

By contrast, ES-Abr, ES-LM1 and US-Ton often overestimated ET during the seasonal drought period. For ES-Abr and ES-LM1, this is particularly apparent during the 2016 dry period, largely due to the sustained H underestimation.

Tov/ET was largest in AU-Dry (i.e., 45±11 %) and lowest in ES-Abr and ES-LM1 with mean annual contributions of 31±9 and 34±11 %, respectively. In US-Ton, the mean Tov/ET was much more variable (40±29 %) due to the deciduous nature of the tree species.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The proposed 3SEB model improved the depiction and simulation of water and energy fluxes for heterogeneous semi-arid TGE landscapes, typically poorly represented by state-of-theart models <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Majozi et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Ramoelo et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Whitley et al. 2017</ref>). In the four sites, 3SEB accurately simulated ET (RMSD &lt; 0.5 mm/day) and related energy fluxes (midday H RMSD ~60 W/m 2 ). The model structure also demonstrated robustness when applied at the continental scale (LE RMSD ~90 W/m 2 ), along with reproducing flux dynamics for sites with spatial and temporal variability in canopy cover, P and LAI. Furthermore, it consistently improved over TSEB and TSEB-2S with fewer overall errors (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), along with less intra-and IAV of errors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). These semi-arid ecosystems often switch from being carbon sinks and sources. Therefore, better capturing the IAV is particularly relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Biederman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">El-Madany et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Burchard-Levine et al. (2021)</ref>, the combination of tree and grass features in TGEs caused large uncertainties when using effective input/parameter values at coarser spatial scales (pixel size &gt; 10 m). Along with spatial complexities, the 3SEB model incorporated the distinct overstory and understory phenological dynamics of the TGEs semi-arid vegetation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Whitley et al. (2017)</ref> highlighted these considerations as important characteristics generally not accounted for within land surface models, misrepresenting and generating uncertainty over TGEs. In particular, the seasonal dry-down induces an even greater landscape heterogeneity with important mixing of senesced and active understory vegetation along with the overstory. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>, 3SEB better captured these transitional periods, as the LAI is decoupled and the phenology of each vegetation source can change independently. It is more challenging to represent the heterogeneity present through effective values (e.g., TSEB) for a landscape with dual vegetation layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Burchard-Levine et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2021)</ref>. To account for this, TSEB-2S alters the model parameterization assuming either the understory or overstory vegetation as dominant. However, the sharp change in the parameterization caused uncertainty during the seasonal transition periods, when both vegetation sources co-dominate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>; S4). This was particularly evident in US-Ton, where TSEB-2S had large errors at the beginning of the summer season (~June, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>), subsequently decreasing during the peak seasonal drought periods (~July-August), when the understory had largely senesced.</p><p>As a proof of concept, 3SEB was applied at the continental scale over Africa, Europe and neighboring regions from other continents. Quasi-global datasets available from LSA-SAF and ancillary data sources parameterized the model. The promising evaluation over three sites rendered errors only slightly greater than the site-level simulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>). LE errors increased more significantly than H due to more uncertainty in the AE estimation (i.e. Rn -G, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S9</ref>). This was expected due to numerous reasons. First off, the ERA-5 reanalysis meteorological and LSA-SAF shortwave irradiance data inputs are likely to add more uncertainty, compared to locally measured meteorological and irradiance data. Crucially, shortwave irradiance directly affects Rn estimations and, thus, LE as it estimated as the residual of the EB. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S9</ref> shows that LSA-SAF irradiance inputs are highly correlated to tower measurements in all sites. Nevertheless, important errors are present (RSMD &gt;100W/m 2 ), translating to nosier modeled outputs. Secondly, there is a large spatial scale mismatch between the pixel size (~5km) and the EC tower footprint (~hundreds of meters). This substantially increases pixel heterogeneity, which may induce greater uncertainty to the primary (i.e. LST, LAI) and ancillary (i.e., fg, fc, hc,) inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chu et al., 2021)</ref>. Despite these greater sources of errors from model inputs, 3SEB performed relatively well at the MSG pixel level, obtaining similar errors statistics as the 20m Sen-ET retrievals (LE RMSD ~80-100 W/m 2 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guzinski et al. 2020)</ref>, and performed better than the LSA-SAF ET product (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8</ref>). These promising results demonstrate 3SEB's potential application on the operational level or incorporated within global Earth System Models.</p><p>In addition to improving flux estimates in these complex landscapes, 3SEB explicitly decomposes ET into the different vegetation and land surface components. Research on ET partitioning from biotic and abiotic sources (i.e., T/ET) has gained traction because of its key links to plant water use and limitations in the context of climate and agronomic sciences <ref type="bibr">(Anderson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fisher et al., 2017)</ref>.

However, these reported global T/ET values carry large uncertainty, ranging between ~30-90% <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Stoy et al., 2019)</ref>. 3SEB reported here a T/ET between 44-66% at site scale, which aligned well with the TEA algorithm (RMSD: ~ 0.6 mm/day), and 50.5% for the continental-scale (~Africa and Europe) 3SEB simulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12d</ref>). A meta-analysis of T/ET estimates over 38 semi-arid sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sun et al., 2019)</ref> reported the T/ET was roughly 50%, as similarly reported in this study.</p><p>Soil evaporation (Esoil/ET) was largest in ES-Abr and ES-LM1 representing around ~55% of ET. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Perez-Priego et al. (2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2018)</ref> who show that the understory ET dominated in ES-LM1. In fact, Esoil/ET in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Perez-Priego et al. (2018)</ref> reached up to ~70% during the growing period through lysimeter measurements and a novel ET partitioning method, similar to that achieved with 3SEB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). The summer drought maintained relatively large Esoil/ET. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Perez-Priego et al. (2018)</ref> observed considerable soil evaporation rates even when the shallow (i.e., sandy) soil was dry, indicating the evaporation rates may be upheld from moisture of the deeper soil (e.g., clay) layer.</p><p>While past studies suggested T/ET to be independent from P (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fatichi and Pappas, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Schlesinger and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jasechko, 2014, Sun et al. 2019)</ref>, mean annual T/ET correlated positively here with annual P (r = 0.58, p = 0.02; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>). In water-limited ecosystems, ET partitioning might be more strongly linked to P and water availability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Perez-Priego et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">El-Madany et al. (2020)</ref> reported very strong linear correlations between annual P and GPP for ES-Abr and ES-LM1, which has mechanistic links to T. At the monthly scale, Tun/ET and Tov/ET had opposing relations with seasonal P. This further demonstrated the contrasting survival strategies of both vegetation functional types. The tree overstory has large root systems to access deeper soil moisture sources and remain physiologically active during the dry season (Archibald and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Scholes, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Higgins et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018)</ref>. Their growth is less dependent on rainfall events or other meteorological cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Archibald and Scholes, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Higgins et al., 2011)</ref>. By contrast, herbaceous understory species respond quickly to water availability, opting for an annual phenology to avoid the drought season <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bond, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Moore et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, Tov/ET is usually greater during the dry months with the inactivity of understory species, and hence the negative correlation. Interestingly, Tov/ET was positively related to P at the annual scale (r = 0.43, p = 0.1). This fact suggests that, while seasonal water availability is not important for tree species, the long-term P is. However, this non-significant relationship (p &gt; 0.05) needs more observations to confirm this trend. At the ecosystem level, there was no significant correlation between monthly T/ET and P (r = 0.05, p = 0.5), due to the contrasting relation each of the vegetation layers had with seasonal P.</p><p>Other studies reported stronger links between T/ET and LAI compared to P (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sun et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Wang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wei et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wei et al. (2017)</ref> developed empirical models for different land cover types to obtain T/ET estimates from LAI. Nevertheless, they stated that savanna ecosystems presented large uncertainties due to the overstory and understory differences in water uptake processes. Indeed, LAI did not explain a large portion of the T/ET variance (r = 0.4). However, the relationship was much stronger with LAI (r = 0.77), after separating the fluxes to consider only Tun/ET. Furthermore, Tun/[Tun+Esoil] was highly correlated with the understory LAIun (r = 0.83), with a similar fitted power function to <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wei et al. (2017)</ref>. This result is somewhat expected since LAIun is an input to 3SEB. Nonetheless, it illustrates the advantage of decomposing the flux and vegetation components in TGEs. Indeed, this has important implications for land surface models, which often rely heavily on LAI through a 'big leaf' approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lian et al, 2018)</ref>. While certain models consider horizontal heterogeneity within modeling grids, the integration of different vertical layers (e.g. overstory and understory) are rarely considered in Earth system models. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bonan et al. (2021)</ref>, 'big leaf' canopies may oversimplify complex vertical vegetation structures and processes, resulting in poorer model robustness compared to multi-layered models. This canopy misrepresentation is particularly relevant in TGEs, having two vegetation layers with highly different survival strategies and characteristics, making it inadequate to relate singular bulk biophysical variables to represent vegetation functioning at the ecosystem scale (as supported by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>). The simple, yet effective, dual vegetation layer representation in 3SEB is a way forward for future model development, particular for landscapes with important differences in the overstory and understory canopies.</p><p>The 3SEB processed-based T/ET partitioning compared well with the data-driven TEA, even though they have very different and independent approaches. While TTEA is not a measured dataset, its highly data-driven approach allows for an appropriate benchmark, especially considering the limitations (an unavailability) of T/ET measurements, such as sap flux or isotopic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anderson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kool et al., 2014)</ref>. TEA exploits ET's link with GPP and does not incorporate inputs related to vegetation structure (e.g., ℎ 𝑐 , LAI). Despite this, the sites assessed rendered high T correlations from both methods (r &gt; 0.75) and obtained similar magnitudes. The largest discrepancies occurred in US-Ton during the summer drought, with large T3SEB overestimations compared to TTEA. The understory EC tower in US-Ton corroborated this pattern, as the model systematically overestimated Hsub (Hun + Hsoil) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). Total ecosystem H was well modeled and even slightly underestimated (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), indicating that Hov was substantially underestimated. Since the residual of the energy balance determined LE, the underestimated Hov suggests LEov was overestimated, as supported through the TTEA comparison.</p><p>The apparent LEov overestimation in US-Ton may be linked to the constant LAIov forced into 3SEB, including uncertainty in capturing US-Ton's more dynamic deciduous overstory phenology. This would primarily affect the amount of radiation intercepted (and available) by overstory (i.e. Rnov) as LAI is the main input of the RTM within 3SEB (section S1 in SI). However, the estimated leaf-on LAIov in US-Ton (and other sites) was well captured compared to previous measurements found in the literature (see S4.2 in SI). In fact, a local sensitivity analysis of LAIov showed very little effect of this input on T/ET estimates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>). As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Ryu et al. (2012)</ref> with upward-point cameras in US-Ton, LAIov peaks during the initial leaf-on period at around ~0.85 m 2 /m 2 , but gradually declines to ~0.7 m 2 /m 2 , before the rapid decrease in LAI during the leaf-off. Additionally, during the same seasonal period, <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Xu and Baldocchi (2003)</ref> showed gradual decreases in carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance from the tree overstory. These results demonstrate their conservative water saving strategies during dry conditions. Similar observations were reported for trees in both Spanish and Australian sites <ref type="bibr">(Luo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Moore et al., 2016)</ref> These findings suggest that trees in semi-arid climates hold a strong physiological control on ET, regulating their stomata during periods of sustained increases in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Niinemets, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pérez-Priego et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Villalobos et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Villalobos et al., , 2000))</ref>. 3SEB may not adequately depict this stomatal control, especially in relation to VPD, resulting in the LEov overestimation apparent in US-Ton. This effect is likely more pronounced in US-Ton, due to the larger tree overstory canopy cover (48%) compared to other sites (~20%). Certain studies suggested that the potential PT coefficient (i.e., 𝛼 𝑃𝑇 in Eq. 5.1) is closer to ~1 in trees, even with ample water availability, instead of the widely used 1.26 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Andreu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baldocchi and Xu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Black, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Shuttleworth and Calder, 1979)</ref>. To test this, 3SEB was also forced with 𝛼 𝑃𝑇 = 1 for the overstory ET initialization, which slightly improved T/ET estimates in US-Ton (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S6</ref>) but further underestimated ET in AU-Dry (data not shown). This suggests that 3SEB should directly incorporate the physiological control of stomatal resistance, instead of calibrating the 𝛼 𝑃𝑇 parameter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Colaizzi et al. (2014)</ref> applied the Penman-Monteith (PM) formulation within TSEB to derive the initial canopy T, which resulted in better T/ET agreement over a semi-arid cultivated site compared to the PT approach. However, they applied it with a constant maximum stomatal conductance. Therefore, the use of a tree stomatal closure constraint with increasing VPD (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Damour et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Miner et al., 2017)</ref>, coupled with the PM initialization, may be a way forward to improve 3SEB's Tov/ET estimates.</p><p>The proposed MODIS-based LAI partitioning method seemingly captured the understory LAI dynamics in both magnitude and timing for TGEs (Section S4.2 in SI). The retrieved LAIun had low errors compared to in-situ destructive measurements in ES-LM1 and US-Ton (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). However, ES-LM1 observed important LAIun underestimations against LAItotal, especially during the dry periods of highly productive years. Very low LAIun values (i.e., &lt; 0.5 m 2 /m 2 ) during the seasonal drought caused non-linear increases to the bulk vegetation resistance Rx (data not shown), which is negatively related to LAI (Eq. S11). These highly productive years led to increased amounts of remaining dry vegetation biomass during the seasonal drought period. The dead vegetation, while not active, increased the roughness of the landscape. This issue induced more aerodynamic conductivity and H. This situation was most evident during 'wet' years with large vegetation productivity, most visible in 2016 for ES-Abr and ES-LM1, which suffered important LE biases during the seasonal drought (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). The in-situ data in ES-LM1 revealed that LAItotal remained between 0.5-1 m 2 /m 2 during the peak drought period. By contrast, the MODIS estimated LAIun was &lt; 0.4 m 2 /m 2 . MODIS LAI product refers to LAIgreen <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fensholt et al., 2004)</ref>, whereas LAItotal affects the resistance and radiation partition of the landscape. This demonstrated the Rx sensitivity to the LAI uncertainty at very low magnitudes, which should include non-green elements (i.e., LAItotal or PAI). During the growing season, high LAI values are largely composed of green material, making LAIgreen a good estimate of LAItotal. However, LAItotal deviated from LAIgreen during the seasonal drought due to the large presence of senescent vegetation.</p><p>The effect of senescent vegetation on biophysical variables remains challenging to quantify <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Martín et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Melendo-Vega et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2020)</ref>. More specific retrieval methods, such as applying RTMs incorporating senescent vegetation may improve LAI estimations (e.g., SenSCOPE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Proctor et al., 2017)</ref>. The need for a complete annual time series, with both rainy and dry seasons, was another drawback of the LAI partitioning method presented here. This makes the current model set-up applicable for only nontime-critical diagnosis or hindcast purposes as it cannot dynamically separate LAI as it is prescribed. Spectral unmixing techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Meyer and Okin, 2015)</ref> may be a way forward to improve the LAI retrievals and partitioning in these dual-vegetated landscapes. Other data streams like spaceborne LiDAR data from NASA's GEDI mission also open new opportunities to retrieve more accurate plant structural (e.g., hc, fc) and biophysical (e.g., PAI) variables in complex ecosystems <ref type="bibr">(Dubayah et al. 2020)</ref>. Other remaining challenges include adequately quantifying the Rn in these heterogenous landscapes, particularly with the use of global shortwave irradiance inputs. The 3SEB estimated Rn remains slightly underestimated (see Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> in SI) with scarce measured data available to validate its decomposition across canopy sources. Three-dimensional RTMs, such as the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gastellu-Etchegorry et al., 2015)</ref> or as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kobayashi et al. (2012)</ref> may serve as a framework to better characterize Rn in these complex ecosystems.</p></div>

The model performed well despite the highly variable climatic and vegetation conditions. 3SEB largely improved the energy flux modeling compared to TSEB and TSEB-2S. It slightly underestimated ET for AU-Dry due to H overestimation during the peak biomass. By contrast, ES-LM1 and US-Ton slightly overestimated LE during the seasonal drought, particularly for highly productive (i.e., 'wet') years. This issue was linked to the Rx overestimation at very low LAI values (&lt; 0.5 m 2 /m 2 ). The LAIun input was slightly underestimated compared to field measurements in ES-LM1 and US-Ton, and particularly lower compared to LAItotal measurements in ES-LM1. This highlights the importance of accounting for the large effect of senescent vegetation on remote sensing derived LAI products, notably in semi-arid ecosystems, which play an important role in the transfer of radiation and turbulence. Continental-scale 3SEB results forced with SEVIRI/MSG data also showed promising results. However, the larger uncertainty from model inputs, particularly shortwave irradiance, and spatial mismatch between pixel and tower scales caused larger modeling errors.</p><p>3SEB additionally separated ET into the different tree-grass-soil components of the landscapes, not previously possible with available data-driven methods. The 3SEB T/ET partitioning compared well to the data-driven TEA algorithm (r &gt; 0.76) and demonstrated the contrasting relations of the two vegetation layers in TGEs with seasonal P. This fact confirmed their different survival strategies. T/ET was not very correlated with LAIMODIS at the ecosystem level. However, the relation was much stronger when decomposing T/ET and LAI into the different vegetation layers. These findings should alleviate the disproportionally large uncertainty of global remote sensing-based ET products in these important and extensive ecosystems, along with offering a simple multi-layer approach of potential use to Earth system models. 3SEB presents a new framework to understand the role of complex and distinct vegetation dynamics, at both temporal and spatial scales, in modulating ecosystem level fluxes and water scarcity.</p></div>
