<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a structural equation model, which reduces to a multidimensional latent class item response theory model, for the analysis of binary item responses with non-ignorable missingness. The missingness mechanism is driven by two sets of latent variables: one describing the propensity to respond and the other referred to the abilities measured by the test items. These latent variables are assumed to have a discrete distribution, so as to reduce the number of parametric assumptions regarding the latent structure of the model. Individual covariates may also be included through a multinomial logistic parametrization of the probabilities of each support point of the distribution of the latent variables. Given the discrete nature of this distribution, the proposed model is efficiently estimated by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the finitesample properties of the parameter estimates. Moreover, an application is illustrated to data coming from a Students' Entry Test for the admission to some university courses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A relevant problem in applications of Item Response Theory (IRT) models is related to missing responses to some items. Following the general theory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Little and Rubin (2002)</ref>, we define missing item responses to be ignorable if: (i) these responses are missing at random (MAR), that is, the event that the response to an item is missing is conditionally independent of the (unobservable) response to this item given the observed responses to the other items and (ii) the missing mechanism is governed by a model based on a distinct set of parameters with respect to the parameters of the model governing the response process. Under ignorability, maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the IRT model of interest is only based on the observed responses.</p><p>Obviously, when condition (i) or (ii) above does not hold, then missing responses are nonignorable and the missingness mechanism must be modeled along with the relationships of direct interest to avoid wrong inferential conclusions and loss of relevant information for the assessment of the examinees' ability level. A typical example of non-ignorable missing responses (or missing not at random, MNAR) is observed with educational tests where, in order to avoid guessing, a wrong item response is penalized to a greater extent in comparison with a missing response. In such a context, it is natural to suppose that the choice of not answering to a given item is related to the ability (or abilities) measured by the test.</p><p>In the statistical literature there exist different approaches to model a non-ignorable missing mechanism. Among the best known, we recall the selection approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Diggle and Kenward, 1994)</ref> and the pattern-mixture approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Little, 1993)</ref>. The first formulation defines a joint model of observed and missing responses and factorizes the corresponding distribution in a marginal distribution for the complete data (union of observed and missing responses) and a conditional distribution for the missing data given the complete data. In contrast, the pattern-mixture approach specifies the marginal distribution for the missing responses and the conditional distribution of the complete data given the missing responses.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Formann (2007)</ref> showed that on the basis of the latent class (LC) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goodman, 1974)</ref> it is possible to define class of MNAR models, which is distinct from that of selection models and that of pattern-mixture models. He treated the presence of non-ignorable missing entries in the case of repeated measurements of the same variable or observations of different variables made on the same individuals. The approach is based on creating an extra category for missing responses, so as to model the missingness mechanism, and analyzing the data coded in this way by means of an LC model. In this way each latent class is also characterized in terms of missing responses. Moreover, individual covariates may influence the class weights, so that the latent class distribution becomes individual-specific as in the latent regression models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bandeen-Roche et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bartolucci and Forcina (2006)</ref>.</p><p>In the statistical literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Harel and Schafer (2009)</ref> proposed the use of LC models to treat cases where missingness is only partially ignorable. They introduced the concepts of partial ignorability, which supposes that a summary of the missing-data indicators depends on the missing values, and of latent ignorability, based on assuming that the missing-data indicators depend on a summary of the missing values. In the context of item responses, they proposed to create a binary missingness indicator corresponding to each item and to fit an LC model treating these indicators as additional items. In this way, each latent class does not only summarize answers to questionnaire items, but the individual propensity to answer.</p><p>In the IRT context, which is of our specific interest, several approaches may be adopted to deal with MNAR responses. The most naive ones consist of adopting simple IRT models that ignore the missing responses or consider the omissions as wrong responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bradlow and Thomas (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rose et al. (2010)</ref> warned against the drawbacks of these approaches, which lead to biased estimates of model parameters and, therefore, to unfair comparisons between persons. To overcome these limitations, several authors proposed approaches based on modeling the nonignorable missingness process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Moustaki and Knott (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Moustaki and O'Muircheartaigh (2000)</ref>, among others, discussed a nominal IRT model, with possible covariates for the ability, where the missing responses are treated as separate response categories, elaborating an original idea by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bock (1972)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rose et al. (2010)</ref> proposed a latent regression model where the latent ability is regressed on the observed response rate, referring in this way the missingness mechanism to the covariates rather than to the responses.</p><p>An interesting stream of research has been introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lord (1983)</ref>, who suggested to treat the problem of MNAR responses by assuming that the observed item responses depend both on the latent ability (or abilities), intended to be measured by the test, and on another latent variable which represents the "temperament" of respondents, and describes their propensity to respond. Elaborating the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lord (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Holman and Glas (2005)</ref> discussed a unified model-based approach for handling non-ignorable missing data and, therefore, assessing the extent to which the missingness mechanism may be ignored. The adopted approach relies on multidimensional IRT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Reckase, 2010)</ref> and on the assumption that the latent traits are normally distributed.</p><p>It is also worth recalling the work of Bertoli-Barsotti and Punzo (2013) that proposed an alternative non-parametric approach based on the conditional maximum likelihood estimation method, where a multidimensional IRT model is specified according to the Rasch model assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rasch, 1960)</ref>. The main drawback of the conditional approach is that it does not allow us to measure the correlation between the assumed latent variables; moreover, its use is limited to settings for which the Rasch model is realistic.</p><p>The above mentioned approaches based on the introduction of a latent variable describing the tendency to respond are well suited to a Structural Equation Model (SEM) formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Goldberger, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Duncan, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bollen et al., 2008)</ref>, which allows for several types of generalizations (e.g., semiparametric specification of the latent trait distribution and effect of individual covariates on the latent traits).</p><p>Aim of the present article is to introduce a SEM, which reduces to a special type of multidimensional LC IRT model, to deal with non-ignorable missing responses to a set of test items. The model is based on the assumption of discreteness of the latent variables, not only for the response process but also for the missingness process. Therefore, with respect to traditional SEM, the proposed model takes the form of a finite mixture SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Jedidi et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dolan and van der Maas, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arminger et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The basic model we rely on was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bartolucci (2007)</ref> and it is based on two main assumptions: (i) more latent traits can be simultaneously considered and each item is associated with only one of them (between-item multidimensionality, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al., 1997)</ref>, and (ii) these latent traits are represented by a random vector with a discrete distribution common to all subjects, so that each support point of such a distribution identifies a different latent class of individuals having homogenous unobservable characteristics. Moreover, with binary response variables, either a Rasch or a two-parameter logistic (2PL) parametrization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Birnbaum, 1968</ref>) may be adopted for the probability of a correct response to each item. In this context, we propose to include a further discrete latent variable to model the probability of observing a response to each item, so that the non-ignorable missing process may be treated in a semiparametric way, as made for the response process. Other than extending the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bartolucci (2007)</ref> to allow for missingness, we also extend it to allow for latent individual covariates which may explain the probability of belonging to a given latent class.</p><p>The approach proposed in this article joins the latent class approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Formann (2007)</ref> with the parametric approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Holman and Glas (2005)</ref> developed in the IRT setting. Several advantages with respect to the last one may be found. First, the proposed model is more flexible because it does not introduce any parametric assumption about the distribution of the latent variables. Second, detecting homogenous classes of individuals is convenient for certain decisional processes, because individuals in the same class may be associated to the same decision (e.g., students admitted, admitted with reserve, not admitted to university courses). Finally, our model allows us to skip the well-known problem of the intractability of multidimensional integrals which characterizes the marginal log-likelihood function of a continuous multidimensional IRT model. Indeed, parameter estimation may be performed through the discrete marginal maximum likelihood method, based on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dempster et al., 1977)</ref>, and implemented in an R function that we make publicly available.</p><p>In order to assess the finite-sample properties of the parameter estimates obtained from the EM algorithm, we have performed a simulation study under different scenarios corresponding to different structures of missing data. In this way, we can also assess the impact of missing data on the quality of the parameter estimates with respect to the case in which all data are observed. The proposed approach is also illustrated through an application to real data coming from the Students' Entry Test given at the Faculty of Economics of an Italian university in 2011. The test is composed of 36 multiple-choice items devoted to measure three latent abilities (Logic, Mathematics, and Verbal comprehension) and certain covariates are also included.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first describe the proposed structural model to account for the presence of non-ignorable missing responses in the IRT context and its statistical formulation. Then, some details about the estimation procedure through the EM algorithm are described together with other details about likelihood inference. In the sequel, we illustrate the simulation study to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed approach. The application of the proposed approach to the data arising from the Students' Entry Test is illustrated in the last section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Proposed SEM formulation</head><p>In this section, we describe the proposed approach to model MNAR item responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Little and Rubin, 2002)</ref>. We begin by illustrating the proposed SEM and then we provide the resulting statistical formulation which may be cast in the class of multidimensional IRT models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Structural model</head><p>For a random subject drawn from the population of interest, denote by Y j the response provided by the subject to binary item j, with j = 1, . . . , m. In order to model the response process, we have to consider that the subject may answer correctly (Y j = 1) or incorrectly (Y j = 0) or he/she may skip the question, so that Y j can be observed or not. Therefore, for j = 1, . . . , m, we also introduce the binary indicator R j equal to 1 if the individual provides a response to item j and to 0 otherwise (i.e., Y j is missing); see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Harel and Schafer (2009)</ref>. Moreover, we consider a set of c exogenous individual covariates denoted by X 1 , . . . , X c .</p><p>In order to explain the association between the exogenous variables X 1 , . . . , X c and the endogenous variables Y 1 , . . . , Y m , we introduce two latent variables. The first of these latent variables, denoted by U , represents the latent trait that is measured by the test items (e.g., ability in Mathematics). The second latent variable, denoted by V , is interpreted as the propensity to answer (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lord, 1983)</ref>, the opposite of an aversion to risk if a wrong response is somehow penalized. Based on these latent variables and considering Y j and R j as deriving from a dis-cretization of continuous variables denoted by Y * j and R * j , we formulate the following equations entering the measurement component of the proposed SEM:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y j = I{Y * j ≥ 0}, (1) R j = I{R * j ≥ 0}, (2) Y * j = α j U -β j + ε 1j , (3) R * j = γ 1j U + γ 2j V -δ j + ε 2j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>for j = 1, . . . , m, where I{•} is the indicator function equal to 1 if its argument is true and to 0 otherwise and ε 1j and ε 2j are independent error terms. Moreover, the slope α j measures the effect of an increase of the latent variable U on Y * j and, similarly, γ 1j and γ 2j measure the effect on R * j of U and V , respectively. According to the proposed model, the observed response to a given item j depends only on the latent ability U measured by the test, whereas the event of answering to item j depends both on U and on the propensity to respond V . Therefore, provided that γ 2j &gt; 0, R * j tends to increase with the propensity to respond given the latent ability level. Similarly, provided that γ 1j &gt; 0, R * j tends to increase with the ability level even if the propensity to answer remain constant. The idea behind this assumption is that better students are more willing to respond due to their confidence on the correctness of the response. Note that the adopted formulation reminds model G3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Holman and Glas (2005)</ref>, whereas model G2 proposed by the same authors is obtained by imposing the constraint γ 1j = 0, j = 1, . . . , m, which implies the absence of any direct effect of U on R * j and, therefore, denotes that the missingness process may be ignored. Finally, β j and δ j denote other two parameters characterizing item j, which may be interpreted as difficulty parameters because higher values of them correspond to smaller values of Y * j and R * j .</p><p>The proposed SEM formulation is completed by assuming that: (i ) the latent variables U and V are conditionally independent given the covariates X 1 , . . . , X c and that (ii ) a direct effect of these covariates on the response variables is ruled out. How we formulate the conditional distributions of U and V given the covariates will be clarified in the following section.</p><p>The above approach may be easily extended to the multidimensional case with items measuring s different latent traits (e.g., ability in Mathematics, ability in Logic, ability in Verbal comprehension), which are represented by the latent variables U 1 , . . . , U s , assuming, in addition to (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y * j = α j s d=1 z dj U d -β j + ε 1j ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">R * j = γ 1j s d=1 z dj U d + γ 2j V -δ j + ε 2j ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>for j = 1, . . . , m. In comparison with the structural model based on equations (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">4</ref>), the new one changes in the last two equations involving the indicator variables z dj , which are equal to 1 if item j measures latent trait of type d and to 0 otherwise. A between-item multidimensional approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams et al., 1997)</ref> is assumed with reference to the measurement of the s latent abilities, indicating that each item measures only one of them. On the other hand, a withinitem multidimensional approach is here adopted for the indicator R j , since it is affected by two latent variables. In any case, our conceptual model still assumes one latent variable V for the propensity to answer (for an illustration see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). A possible alternative, which is more complex to deal with, is represented by the introduction of s latent variables V 1 , . . . , V s for the propensity to answer, one for each latent variable U 1 , . . . , U s .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Statistical model</head><p>In order to estimate the structural model outlined above, we need to formulate assumptions on the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the covariates and on the distribution of the error terms ε 1j and ε 2j in the equations for Y * j and R * j . Regarding the first aspect, we assume that the vector of latent variables (U 1 , . . . , U s ) and V are independent, given the covariates X 1 , . . . , X c , and have a discrete distribution, with k 1 support points (u 1h 1 , . . . , u sh 1 ) , h 1 = 1, . . . , k 1 , and k 2 support points v h 2 , h 2 = 1, . . . , k 2 , respectively. The corresponding weights are denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">λ h 1 (x) = p(U 1 = u 1h 1 , . . . , U s = u sh 1 |X 1 = x 1 , . . . , X c = x c ), h 1 = 1, . . . , k 1 , π h 2 (x) = p(V = v h 2 |X 1 = x 1 , . . . , X c = x c ), h 2 = 1, . . . , k 2 ,</formula><p>which depend on the column vector of observed individual covariates x = (x 1 , . . . , x c ) . This is equivalent to assuming that individuals come from latent classes which are internally homogenous in terms of the latent traits measured by the questionnaire. Note that, with respect to traditional LC models, there is not a set of weights common to all subjects in the sample, but weights λ h 1 (x) and π h 2 (x) which are subject-specific, as they depend on the individual covariates. In particular, we assume the following multinomial logistic parametrization, which is similar to that adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Formann (2007)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">log λ h 1 +1 (x) λ 1 (x) = φ 0h 1 + x φ 1h 1 , h 1 = 1, . . . , k 1 -1,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where φ 0h 1 and φ 1h 1 are regression parameters to be estimated. A similar parametrization, based on regression parameters ψ 0h 2 and ψ 1h 2 , is assumed for the conditional probabilities</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">π h 2 (x), h 2 = 1, . . . , k 2 -1.</formula><p>Regarding the error terms ε 1j and ε 2j , we assume that they are independent and have a standard logistic distribution. This is a convenient assumption implying that the distribution of Y j and R j given the corresponding latent variables satisfies a logistic model. In particular, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p h 1 j = p(Y j = 1|U 1 = u 1h 1 , . . . , U s = u sh 1 ), h 1 = 1, . . . , k 1 q h 1 h 2 j = p(R j = 1|U 1 = u 1h 1 , . . . , U s = u sh 1 , V = v h 2 ), h 2 = 1, . . . , k 2 ,</formula><p>we have the following 2PL parametrization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Birnbaum, 1968)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">log p h 1 j 1 -p h 1 j = α j s d=1 z dj u dh 1 -β j , j = 1, . . . , m,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">log q h 1 h 2 j 1 -q h 1 h 2 j = γ 1j s d=1 z dj u dh 1 + γ 2j v h 2 -δ j , j = 1, . . . , m.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Using the terminology of IRT models, α j , γ 1j , and γ 2j are discriminating parameters and β j and δ j are difficulty parameters. In particular, α j measures the discriminating power of item j, that is, how the probability of responding correctly to the item depends on the latent ability, whereas γ 1j and γ 2j measure how the probability of responding (correctly or not) to item j depends on both latent ability and propensity to answer, respectively. A more parsimonious model is obtained by constraining all the discriminating parameters to be equal one other, that is, α j = 1, γ 1j = 1, and γ 2j = 1 for j = 1, . . . , m. In this way a Rasch type model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rasch, 1960)</ref> is specified. The parametrization illustrated above may be extended to take into account general situations, such as that of differential effects of U d on R * j across the latent classes h 1 = 1, . . . , k 1 . For this aim, we should introduce a discriminating parameter depending on the specific latent class; therefore we have to substitute γ 1j with γ 1h 1 j in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>). However, generalizations of this type give rise to more complex models, the interpretation and estimation of which may be complicate.</p><p>The assumptions formulated in the previous section imply an assumption that in the IRT literature is known as local independence; see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hambleton and Swaminathan (1985)</ref>. In the present context, this assumption means that all variables Y 1 , . . . , Y m and R 1 , . . . , R m are conditionally independent given the latent vector (U 1 , . . . , U s , V ) . In particular, for j = 1, . . . , m, there is conditional independence between the response Y j (observable or not) and the indicator for response R j , given the latent variables. This condition is similar to that of non-ignorable random-coefficient-based drop out <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Little, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The above assumptions imply that the proposed SEM reduces to a multidimensional IRT model similar to the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bartolucci (2007)</ref> for the augmented set of responses Y 1 , . . . , Y m , R 1 , . . . , R m ; see also Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Davier (2008)</ref>. In particular, this model is characterized by the following features:</p><p>• certain response variable Y j may be missing at random (given also R 1 , . . . , R m ), whereas the variables R j are always observed;</p><p>• every Y j depends on a specific latent variable U d j through a Rasch or a 2PL parametrization, whereas R j depends on both U d j and another latent variable V , being d j the dimension measured by item j (i.e., z dj = 1 if d = d j and z dj = 0 otherwise);</p><p>• the latent variables U 1 , . . . , U s and V have a discrete distribution depending on the individual covariates X 1 , . . . , X c through a multinomial logistic model.</p><p>Consequently, for a vector of observed responses y obs , which is a subvector of (y 1 , . . . , y m ) , and a realization r = (r 1 , . . . , r m ) of R 1 , . . . , R m , we have the manifest distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p(y obs , r|x) = k 1 h 1 =1 k 2 h 2 =1 λ h 1 (x)π h 2 (x)p h 1 h 2 (y obs , r|x),<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">p h 1 h 2 (y obs , r) = m j=1 (r j =1) p y j h 1 j (1 -p h 1 j ) 1-y j m j=1 q r j h 2 j (1 -q h 2 j ) 1-r j ,</formula><p>where the first product is extended to all items j for which a response is observed, and then r j = 1. In fact, this model has a number of free parameters equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">#par = (k 1 + k 2 -2)(c + 1) + sk 1 + k 2 + 2m -(s + 1) + I{a = 1}[3m -(s + 1)],</formula><p>where s + 1 is the total number of latent variables, a = 0 for the Rasch model, and a = 1 for to the 2PL model. In fact, there are k 1 + k 2 -2 regression coefficients for the latent classes for each of the c covariates plus one intercept, sk 1 + k 2 ability parameters, 3m -(s + 1) discriminating parameters (when a = 1), and 2m -(s + 1) difficulty parameters. In fact, s + 1 difficulty parameters must be constrained to 0 and s + 1 discriminating parameters must be constrained to 1 to ensure model identifiability.</p></div>

A multidimensional LC IRT model with the same characteristics as the selected model is then estimated for each bootstrap sample and the corresponding quantities of interest are stored. In this way, an empirical distribution is obtained, on the basis of which the standard errors (and confidence intervals) may be calculated for every parameter estimate of interest. Note that the described approach requires some caution. In particular, as the ordering of latent classes may change from sample to sample, it has to be fixed on the basis of some criteria, such as on the basis of the estimated supported points. We also outline that the bootstrap resampling procedure is distribution-free; therefore, it allows us to preserve the advantages of our semi-parametric approach and it represents a simple method to estimate standard errors having a complicated distribution.</p><p>Finally, it is important to recall that the specific LC IRT model that is adopted depends on the chosen number of latent classes (k 1 and k 2 ), the chosen number of latent dimensions (s), and the chosen parametrization of the conditional response probabilities <ref type="bibr">(Rasch or 2PL)</ref>. Therefore, a model selection procedure is usually required in applications involving a certain dataset, unless theoretical considerations do not suggest specific choices, such as a given number of latent classes. For this aim, we suggest to use a likelihood ratio test when the compared models are nested and the usual regularity conditions are met or, more in general, an information criterion, especially in the presence of non-nested models.</p><p>Different information criteria have been proposed in the statistical literature. Among the best known, there are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akaike, 1973)</ref> and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>. In particular, we suggest to use BIC, which is based on the minimization of the index: BIC = -2 ˆ + log(n)#par, where ˆ is the maximum log-likelihood estimate of the model of interest.</p><p>In contrast with AIC, BIC takes into account the sample size, so that it uses a larger penalty for the model complexity (measured in terms of number of parameters), and it is asymptotically consistent for finite mixture models under certain regularity conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Keribin, 2000)</ref>. In particular, BIC tends to select more parsimonious models than AIC. For a detailed description of AIC and BIC we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burnham and Anderson (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yang (2005)</ref>, among others.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Simulation study</head><p>This section illustrates the Monte Carlo simulation experiment we implemented in order to study the finite-sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimates of the proposed model. In this way, we can also evaluate empirically the adequacy of the proposed approach in obtaining reliable estimates of the model parameters and in showing the presence of a non-ignorable missing mechanism for the item responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Simulation setting</head><p>The simulation study is based on a model with two latent abilities, U 1 and U 2 , which drive the observed responses, and another latent construct, V , which corresponds to the tendency to respond. The distribution of these latent variables is based on k 1 = k 2 = 3 latent classes with probabilities affected by two individual covariates, X 1 and X 2 , generated from independent standard normal distributions. For the sample size we considered n = 1000, 2000 and for the number of items m = 20, 40. The items are equally distributed between U 1 and U 2 , so that the first m/2 items are assumed to measure the first latent variable and the second m/2 items are assumed to measure the second latent variable. Moreover, we assumed three types of scenario: (i ) complete cases (with no missing responses), (ii ) presence of missing responses depending on V , and (iii ) presence of missing responses depending on V and on U 1 and U 2 . In this way, we considered a total of 12 different scenarios, which are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, under each of which 1000 samples have been simulated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE 1 HERE</head><p>All the proposed scenarios assume fixed values of the population parameters. In particular, the regression coefficients φ jh of the multinomial logistic model for U 1 and U 2 are such that covariate X 1 has not effect on the distribution of the latent classes (φ 11 = φ 12 = 0), whereas covariate X 2 has effect only on the logit for class 2 versus class 1 (φ 21 = 1 and φ 22 = 0). Then, the intercepts of the model are chosen so that the average weight of the second latent class ( λ2 ) is equal to 0.5, whereas the weights of the other two classes ( λ1 , λ3 ) are equal to 0.25. Finally, regarding the multinomial logistic model for V we assumed ψ jh 2 = φ jh 1 for h 1 , h 2 = 1, 2 and j = 0, 1, 2; consequently the average weight of the second class ( λ2 ) is again equal to 0.5, whereas the average weights of the other two classes (π 1 , π3 ) are equal to 0.25. Moreover, the support points u dh 1 and v h 2 , with d = 1, 2 and h 1 , h 2 = 1, 2, 3, are chosen so that all latent variables have mean 0 and variance 1 and U 1 and U 2 are positively correlated, similarly to the situation illustrated in our application based on the Students' Entry Test.</p><p>Concerning the item parameters, the difficulties β j correspond to sequence of equally spaced points between -2 and 2; the first m/2 parameters refer to items of U 1 and the remaining m/2 to those of U 2 . In this way, there are items with increasing difficulties in both dimensions and the discriminating parameters α j increase from 1 to 2 for U 1 and decrease from 2 to 1 for U 2 . Therefore, four different types of items are considered: items with high β j and high α j , items with low β j and low α j , items with high β j and low α j , and items with low β j and high α j .</p><p>Finally, we set constant values for δ j and γ 2j for j = 1, . . . , m, whereas γ 1j = 0 for j = 1, . . . , m if the missingness depends only on V and γ 1j = 1 for j = 1, . . . , m if it depends also on U 1 and U 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Simulation results</head><p>A bidimensional model with k 1 = k 2 = 3 latent classes and a 2PL parametrization were estimated for every simulated sample generated under each of the 12 scenarios. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, and 4 show the main results of the simulation study, with reference to the estimates of the support points, the regression coefficients, and the item parameters, respectively. In particular, we report the values of the bias and of the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) for each population parameter; for sake of parsimony, we show the average (absolute) value of bias and RMSE for the item parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLES 2, 3 AND 4 HERE</head><p>We observe generally satisfactorily values of both bias and RMSE. We also observe that bias is approximately constant, regardless of the type of scenario. On the other hand, some differences emerge relatively to RMSE. In fact, as may be expected, the RMSE decreases when the number of items m and the sample size n increase, as it is evident by comparing scenarios 1 vs 7, 2 vs 8, and so on for m, and 1 vs 4, 2 vs 5, and so on for n.</p><p>Concerning the trend of RMSE depending on the changes in the missingness structure, we observe that the presence or absence of missing item responses does not modify the values of RMSE in case of regression coefficients, whereas RMSE computed for the item parameters and, though to a lower extent, for the support points is constantly smaller in absence of missingness rather than in its presence (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, respectively). Moreover, some differences emerge by changing the type of missingness dependence. When missing item responses depend only by V , RMSE values for the support points of latent distributions (compare scenarios 2 vs 3, 5 vs 6, and 8 vs 9 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) are higher, those for the regression coefficients tend to be similar, and RMSE values for item parameters are similar or smaller (compare scenarios 5 vs 6 and 11 vs 12 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) rather than when missing item responses depend also on U 1 and U 2 .</p><p>Finally, a special attention must be paid to the results about the discriminant parameters γ 1j . As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, parameters γ 1j are well estimated both when the missingness process depends only on the latent trait V (scenarios 2, 5, 8, and 11) and when it depends also on the abilities U d , d = 1, 2 (scenarios 3, 6, 9, and 12). Therefore, the proposed model allows us to obtain evidence about the effect of the latent abilities on the missing responses and to properly conclude about the ignorability of the missingness process. In practice, discriminant parameter estimates γ1j not significantly different from zero for all items denote that the presence of missing responses does not depend on the abilities, whereas values of γ1j significantly different from 0 (for at least some items) denote that the missing data provides information about the abilities and, accordingly, it cannot be ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Application to Students' Entry Test</head><p>In the following, we first provide a description of the dataset on which the application is based and then we illustrate the main aspects of the estimated model, with special attention to the results concerning the model selection procedure, the estimated latent structure, and the estimated item parameters, even in comparison with the results obtained assuming ignorable missing responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data description</head><p>The dataset contains the responses provided by 1217 students to an Entry Test for the Faculty of Economics of an Italian university in 2011. The test is organized in three disciplinary sections concerning the measurement of the same number of abilities represented here by latent variables: Logic (13 items, measuring latent variable U 1 ), Mathematics (13 items, measuring latent variable U 2 ), and Verbal comprehension (10 items, measuring latent variable U 3 ). Following the proposed approach, we also considered a further latent variable, V , describing the propensity to answer, which is assumed to be independent of (U 1 , U 2 , U 3 ) given the individual covariates. The dataset also contains individual information about three covariates: gender (0 = male, 1 = female), type of secondary school diploma (0 = classical or scientific diploma, 1 = technical or professional diploma), and secondary school final mark (in 100ths).</p><p>All items are of multiple choice type, with one correct answer and four distractors. The recorded data are about the correctness or incorrectness of the provided response. However, since a wrong response penalizes the score more than a response that is not provided, many missing responses exist in the dataset, whose distribution differs both within the three disciplinary sections and between the sections themselves. In average, the percentage of missing responses is equal to 8.9% for Verbal comprehension, 14.6% for Logic, and 38.5% for Mathematics, whereas the percentage of right responses is equal to 73.8%, 59.9%, and 41.1%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Model selection</head><p>To analyze the data described above, we initially considered the proposed model with k 1 = k 2 = 3 latent classes and a Rasch and a 2PL parametrization. The first model, denoted by M 1 , has a maximum-likelihood equal to ˆ = -33528.28 and BIC = 67738.55. For the second model, denoted by M 2 , we have ˆ = -32974.23 and BIC = 67369.29. Therefore, the deviance (likelihood ratio statistic) between the two models is equal to 1108.09 with 104 degrees of freedom leading to reject the Rasch parametrization in favor of the 2PL parametrization. This is also confirmed by the lower value of BIC for M 2 than for M 1 .</p><p>Then we fitted a third model (M 3 ) that is a restricted version of model M 2 in which the abilities do not affect the probability to respond, and then in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">6</ref>) we have γ 1j = 0, j = 1, . . . , m. For model M 3 we have ˆ = -33256.2 and BIC = 67677.48. The deviance between models M 2 and M 3 , equal to 563.93 with 36 degrees of freedom, and the corresponding values of BIC lead to the conclusion that M 3 cannot be accepted and then there is evidence that the different abilities affect the probability to respond to the test items. In this way we respond to the main scientific question behind the present application, that is, whether there is an influence of the abilities measured by the test items on the probability of responding.</p><p>We recall that the above results are based on the assumption that k 1 = k 2 = 3. The choice k 1 = 3 is motivated by the necessity of distinguishing students admitted, admitted with reserve, and not admitted to university courses in Economics. Concerning k 2 , we verified that BIC suggests k 2 &gt; 1, giving some evidence about the presence of a distinct latent trait (V ) other than the abilities U 1 , U 2 , and U 3 . In fact, with k 1 = 3 and k 2 = 1, under the same parametrization of model M 2 we obtain ˆ = -33989.46 and BIC = 69080.07, which is much higher than the value found with k 2 = 3.</p><p>We also verified that the main conclusions of the study are substantially unaffected by the specific number of latent classes that is selected and then we retained k 1 and k 2 equal to 3, also to simplify the interpretation of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Estimated latent structure</head><p>In order to further study the response mechanism of interest in the present application, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> we report the distribution of the latent variables, with support points which are denoted by û * dh 1 and v * h 2 , which are standardized so that each latent distribution has mean 0 and variance 1. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> we also report the estimated correlation coefficients together with the standard errors based on 199 non-parametric bootstrap samples. We recall that these estimates are obtained under model M 2 , that is, the model with 2PL parametrization and covariates affecting the latent distribution, which is based on k 1 = k 2 = 3 support points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLES 5 AND 6 HERE</head><p>Concerning the estimated distribution of abilities measured by the test items, we observe that the latent classes are increasingly ordered for each dimension. Moreover, for each dimension, such a distribution is roughly symmetric, with the support point for the second class close to 0 (corresponding to the mean) and the support points for the first and the third classes which are almost equally distant from 0. The second class has the highest weight (45.2%), whereas the other two classes have a similar weight. On the other hand, for the latent variable representing the tendency to respond, the distribution is far from being symmetric, since there is a small group of subjects, those in the third class, with a high tendency to respond. The other subjects (87%) are in the first two classes and have a low or moderate tendency to respond. Note that the distance between the first and the second class is around one half of the distance between the second and the third.</p><p>Finally, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> we report the estimated regression coefficients of the multinomial logistic models which relates the distribution of the latent variables above with the covariates; see assumption (7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE 7 HERE</head><p>It is worth noting that all covariates have a significant effect on the distribution of the latent classes for the abilities, with females and students having classical or scientific high school diploma that tend to be in classes of lower ability with respect to males and students having technical or professional school diploma, respectively. It is also observed that the probability of belonging to the higher ability classes increases with the final mark. Another important aspect that may be observed on the basis of the estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> is that no covariate has a clearly significant effect on the distribution of the latent variable V and then on the tendency to respond. From the scientific point of view we then conclude that, differently from the abilities, this tendency is rather unpredictable on the basis of the covariates, being related to aspects of the student's personality that are not directly observable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Estimated item parameters</head><p>Another relevant set of estimates to consider is that of the item parameters, which enter in the structural equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">6</ref>) and then in the logistic equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) for the distribution of the response variables given the latent variables. These estimates are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> together with the bootstrap standard errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE 8 HERE</head><p>The first important aspect to consider is that almost all discriminant indices for the abilities (α j ) are significantly different from 0 and positive, with the exception of two items, which are in two distinct sections (Mathematics and Verbal comprehension). In particular, the first of these items is the number 20, for that α20 = -0.022, whereas the second is the number 29, for that α29 = 0.089. These results are rather plausible, since the first of these items has a very low proportion of right answers (5.85%) and the second has a very high proportion of right answers (76.0%) and then they do not provide an adequate discrimination between less and more capable students. Moreover, the first is the most difficult item according to the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> ( β20 = 1.966). On the other hand, the item with the highest discriminant index is the number 24, which has an intermediate proportion of right responses (49.0%). It is also worth noting that many other items have high values of the discriminant index, and then they provide adequate measures of the ability.</p><p>On the basis of the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> we can also deal with one of the main scientific questions behind the present application. In particular, once we have established that at least for some items the probability of responding depends on the ability (see previous section about the preference of model M 2 compared to model M 3 ), we can verify if this is true for all items or not on the basis of the estimates of the parameters γ 1j . We note that there are 14 items for which this coefficient is significantly different from 0 and in all these cases the estimate is positive. Therefore, we conclude that a missing response to one of these items may be interpreted as a sign of low ability level and then this missing response is reasonable to be penalized in scoring the questionnaire. Another relevant aspect is that 10 of these 14 items belong to the section of questionnaire about Mathematics, whereas only 3 belong to the section about Logic and only 1 belongs to the last section about Verbal comprehension. This means that the dependence of the probability to respond on the ability is particularly evident for the items about Mathematics, whereas much less evident for those about Verbal comprehension.</p><p>Finally, the estimates of the discriminant indices γ 2j allow us to conclude that V is an adequate representation of the tendency to respond (independently of the ability level). In fact, these parameters are significantly different from 0 and have a positive estimate for 32 items on 36. The interpretation of the single values of these estimates is similar to that of the estimates of discriminant indices α j relating the ability level to the probability of responding correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Comparison with the missing at random approach</head><p>As suggested by the results about the statistical significance of discriminant parameters γ 1j described in the previous section, we conclude that missing responses are informative about the abilities measured by the test. To further investigate about this issue we have estimated a multidimensional LC IRT model under the assumption of ignorable missingness and we can compare the results with those obtained through our approach which takes the missingness mechanism explicitly into account. Here we present the main results related with the multidimensional LC 2PL model with k 1 = 3 latent classes and s = 3 latent variables (U 1 , U 2 , and U 3 ), being omitted the tendency to answer (V ).</p><p>Obviously, the MAR approach does not allow to get information about the missingness mechanism and to characterize the latent classes in terms of probability of answering. Moreover, the consequences about the inferential conclusions and about the evaluation of individuals are far from trivial.</p><p>First, even if we do not observe any sensible difference under the estimates of the support points (results are here omitted), the MAR assumption causes a different allocation of individuals among the latent classes. Indeed, ordering the latent classes according to the support points, we note that the estimated average weight for class 2 under MAR assumption is higher than the corresponding value under MNAR assumption ( λ2 equals 0.548 and 0.452, respectively), whereas the estimated average weight for class 3 is lower ( λ3 equals 0.189 and 0.280, respectively).</p><p>Second, we also note some relevant differences about the estimates of difficulty parameters, βj . Comparing results in the last two columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> (i.e., αj and βj ) with values αj and βj , we observe several values quite different under the two assumptions. In particular, more unstable estimates are obtained under the MAR approach, as shown by values for items j = 20 and j = 29, where the presence of a very high number of missing responses does not allow to reliably evaluate the difficulty of the corresponding items. Moreover, the estimates for β j are less accurate under the MAR approach, being the standard errors always higher when the missingness mechanism is ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Conclusions</head><p>From the scientific point of view, the main conclusions of the application are the following:</p><p>1. There is a set of items (mostly concentrated in the section about Mathematics) for which the probability to respond significantly depends on the ability and, therefore, it is reasonable to penalize a missing response to these items in scoring the questionnaire.</p><p>2. For the other items (sections about Logic and Verbal comprehension) the probability of responding has a weak dependence on the ability that is measured.</p><p>3. The tendency to respond, considered as a distinct latent variable with respect to the abilities, has a distribution with a shape different from that of the measured abilities. This distribution is asymmetric, with a reduced number of subjects having a very high tendency to respond.</p><p>4. The distribution of the tendency to respond has a weak dependence on individual covariates, as it is related to aspects of the personality that are difficult to be predicted on the basis of observable covariates; on the other hand, the same covariates have a significant effect on the distribution of the abilities.</p><p>5. The alternative simple approach based on ignoring the missing responses modifies the main inferential conclusions about (i ) the allocation of individuals to the latent classes and (ii ) the stability and accuracy of the estimates of the difficulty item parameters.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Proposed SEM for only one covariate (c = 1), four items (m = 4), and two dimensions (s = 2), with the first two items measuring the first dimension and the other two items measuring the second dimension.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Y * 2 Y * 3 Y * 4 R * 1 R * 2 R * 3 U 2 V Y 2 Y 3 Y 4 R 1 R 2 R 3 X 1 Y * 1 Y 1 R * 4 R 4 U 1</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Description of the simulated scenarios by sample size (n), number of items (m), presence of missing item responses (yes/no), and type of dependence of missingness on latent traits (U 1 , U 2 , V ).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Scenario</cell><cell>n</cell><cell>m</cell><cell cols="2">missing item responses</cell><cell>Scenario</cell><cell>n</cell><cell>m</cell><cell>missing item responses</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">presence dependence on</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>presence dependence on</cell></row><row><cell>1</cell><cell cols="2">1000 20</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>7</cell><cell cols="2">1000 40</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell cols="2">1000 20</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>V</cell><cell>8</cell><cell cols="2">1000 40</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>V</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell cols="2">1000 20</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>U 1 , U 2 , V</cell><cell>9</cell><cell cols="2">1000 40</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>U 1 , U 2 , V</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell cols="2">2000 20</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>10</cell><cell cols="2">2000 40</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell cols="2">2000 20</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>V</cell><cell>11</cell><cell cols="2">2000 40</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>V</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell cols="2">2000 20</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>U 1 , U 2 , V</cell><cell>12</cell><cell cols="2">2000 40</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>U 1 , U 2 , V</cell></row></table></figure>
