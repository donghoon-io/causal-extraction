<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background. Coping strategies, competence, and locus of control (LOC) beliefs are important predictors of mental health (MH). However, research into their complex interactions has produced mixed results. Our study investigated them further in the previously unexplored context of clinical high-risk (CHR) of psychosis. Methods. We tested six alternative structural equation models in a community sample (N = 523), hypothesizing a mediating role of coping and treating CHR symptoms as (i) an additional mediator or (ii) a specific outcome. Our measurement model included two latent factors of MH: (1) psychopathology (PP), consisting of presence of mental disorders, global and psychosocial functioning, and (2) self-rated health (SRH) status.</p><p>Results. In the model with the best Akaike Information Criterion and the latent factors as outcome variables, maladaptive coping completely mediated the impact of maladaptive LOC on PP and SRH. Additionally, CHR symptoms partially mediated the effect of maladaptive coping on PP and SRH in the community sample, as long as sex was not entered into the model. In the clinical sample (N = 371), the model did not support a mediation by CHR symptoms, despite significant pathways with both coping and MH outcomes; further, competence beliefs directly impacted SRH. Conclusions. Coping strategies are an important intervention target for MH promotion, especially in the community. In clinical populations, interventions focusing on coping strategies may improve CHR symptoms, thus potentially supporting better MH, especially SRH. Additionally, due to their mostly cascading effects on MH, improving competence and LOC beliefs may also promote psychological well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Psychotic disorders are among the most frequent causes of disability-adjusted life years in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and rate second in resulting costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Psychotic episodes are mostly preceded by a prodromal phase, in which the onset of clinical high-risk (CHR) symptoms, other mental health (MH) problems, and deficits in psychosocial functioning often leads to helpseeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Longer duration of an inadequately treated prodromal phase is associated with negative outcomes of first-episode psychosis (FEP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Therefore, this phase offers a unique point of intervention for an indicated prevention, aimed at reducing CHR symptoms and distress, thereby postponing or preventing manifest psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Despite direct associations of CHR symptoms with distress and an increased risk for psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, relative declines in transition rates and high rates of onset and persistence of nonpsychotic disorders in CHR populations have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This has generated debate regarding diagnostic specificity of CHR in predicting psychosis, with suggestions that it might be pluripotential, indicating risk for developing a range of different psychiatric conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Consequently, it was proposed that the CHR state be redefined as a transdiagnostic at-risk mental state (e.g., Clinical At-Risk Mental State; CHARMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>), allowing for the identification of early signs of multiple severe mental disorders. However, other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> support the diagnostic specificity of CHR symptoms, indicating that only emergent psychotic disorders significantly differentiate between CHR patients and non-CHR help-seeking controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and that the onset and persistence of non-psychotic disorders occur at a similar frequency in both groups, suggesting that a CHR status does not specifically represent a risk factor for non-psychotic disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, while the question of the diagnostic specificity of CHR status remains open, the clinical significance of CHRfor example, psychological burden, independent of conversion to a full-blown mental disorder, and negative impact on functioningis undisputed <ref type="bibr">[10-12, 19, 20, 23]</ref>, and the inclusion of Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome in Section III of DSM-5 supports its diagnostic and psychopathological relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, highlighting the need to focus on offering CHR patients effective interventions. Moreover, irrespective of the debate regarding pluripotentiality of the CHR state, evidence indicates some transdiagnostic relevance of the CHR state (or symptoms) in terms of (at least) comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders and syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This is reflected in new broader transdiagnostic and dimensional psychiatric taxonomies wherein efforts are currently being made to determine the most appropriate way to map CHR for psychosis into these models <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Relatedly, other relevant intervention targets for this population include transdiagnostic factors of core beliefsconsisting of locus of control (LOC) and competence beliefsand coping, demonstrating dysfunctional patterns in CHR <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, FEP <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and schizophrenia patients alike <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, and are regarded as possible predictors of psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. That is, the hypothesis that typical psychotic symptoms, for example, delusions and hallucinations, result from the use of dysfunctional coping and core beliefs in response to basic symptoms (BS; self-experienced subclinical disturbances in thinking, speech, and perception) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and stressful stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Beyond their role in CHR, coping and core beliefs are also relevant for general MH quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, as reflected by multiple outcomes, including psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, and self-assessment of one's own health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Coping is an especially important predictor of MH quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, particularly regarding stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and representing either a risk (maladaptive coping, including avoidant and emotion-oriented strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) or protective factor (adaptive coping, including problem-focused and active strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>). LOC is another predictor for MH <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>: internal LOC (attributing positive events to internal causes and negative ones to external factors such as chance or others) is linked to better MH outcomes and greater resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, while external LOC (the opposite tendency) is associated with psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia as well as generally poorer functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Thus, they can be conceptualized as adaptive and maladaptive, respectively. Finally, competence beliefs, including self-efficacy and self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, are strongly associated with MH quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, with higher competence beliefs being related to better psychosocial functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p><p>Investigations into the interactions between coping, core beliefs, and MH, involving mainly community samples but also including a minority of clinical samples, have led to contradictory findings in both populations, indicating a mediating role of coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> or of core beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. A recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> also mostly, but not exclusively, using community samplessupported a mediation by coping on the influence of core beliefs on MH. Specifically, maladaptive coping mediated the relationship between maladaptive LOC and MH problems. Moreover, both adaptive and maladaptive LOC showed a direct influence on MH problems, independent of coping.</p><p>In the present study, we extended the meta-analytical and mediation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> that had mixed community and clinical samples by first exploring alternative structural equation models (SEM) in a community sample and then examining their validity in a clinical sample. In addition to general psychopathology, we focused on CHR symptoms, in virtue of their association with MH quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as well as coping and core beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The aims of the present study were: 1. To explore the association between core beliefs and MH outcomes, in both a community and a clinical sample, assuming a mediation by coping. Specifically, based on the metanalytical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we anticipated that the effect of competence beliefs and adaptive LOC on MH outcomes would be mediated by adaptive coping, and that the effect of maladaptive LOC would be mediated by maladaptive coping. 2. To investigate the specific placement of CHR symptoms in these interactions.</p><p>Based on the metanalytical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we did not expect relationships between competence beliefs and adaptive LOC, and maladaptive coping or between maladaptive LOC and adaptive coping, and therefore we did not include these relationships in the models.</p></div>

These were conceptualized in our models as competence beliefs (FKK-SK; as recommended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>), adaptive (FKK-I), and maladaptive LOC (FKK-PC; "internality" and "externality" are synonyms for internal, that is, adaptive, and external, that is, maladaptive, LOC, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Statistical analyses</head><p>Data analyses were performed in RStudio, version 4.1.1, using the lavaan package for preliminary exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA, CFA) and testing alternative SEMs, and the sempower package for power analysis. The community sample served as the model generation; the clinical sample as model validation sample.</p><p>First, an EFA was conducted using variables pertaining to participants' MH (presence of Axis-I mental disorders and selfrated health) based on Spearman correlation matrices and using Oblimin rotation, allowing intercorrelation of factors. Pairwise deletion was applied, excluding one participant who was missing 20% of the data. Based on EFA results, we proceeded with a twofactor CFA.</p><p>Finally, six alternative SEMs were computed using the maximum likelihood estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. After a pairwise deletion of five observations with missing data, the analysis was conducted on 518 participants from the community sample. Along with the EFA/CFA factors, variables included age, education, standard T-values for competence beliefs (FKK-SK), maladaptive LOC (FKK-PC), adaptive LOC (FKK-I), adaptive and maladaptive coping, presence of BS and APS/BIPS, or alternatively presence of either of CHR symptoms. A Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) ≥0.90, a comparative fit index (CFI) ≥0.95, a standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) ≤0.08, a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤0.06, as well as a 90% confidence interval (CI) not containing 0.08 indicate excellent model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. As the Chisquared test is sensitive to sample size and often results in model rejection when working with large samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, we focused on the aforementioned indices in evaluating model fit. After comparing the models' Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, one model was selected as fitting the data best; this was validated in the clinical sample.</p><p>The clinical sample (N = 371) presented higher amounts of missing data (9.58%). After applying listwise deletion to 51 participants missing &gt;50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> of their data, we used a multiple imputation method on data missing from the remaining 327 subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</p><p>To control for sex differences, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by including sex in the chosen model and testing it again in both samples. Here the introduction of a categorical variable in the model required the use of the Weighted least squares and varianceadjusted estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. We chose this procedure instead of directly including sex in the six alternative SEMs because using this estimator would not have allowed a statistically valid selection of one best-fitting model. Finally, in all samples, we tested all possible mediation pathways indicated in the selected model for significance and calculated their respective 95% bias-corrected bootstrap CIs.</p></div>

The model's fit to the community sample data was excellent overall (RMSR = 0.01, TLI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.059). The CFA (N = 522) confirmed the two-factor structure (Supplementary eTable 3), showing very good model fit (CFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.990, RMSEA = 0.062, SRMR = 0.032).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SEM models in the community sample</head><p>The resulting latent factors were included in six alternative SEM models (Supplementary eText 6).

Comparison of their AIC and BIC indices, with emphasis on AIC, indicated model 1.2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Supplementary eTable 5) as best fitting the BEAR data (CFI = 0.923, TLI = 0.863, RMSEA = 0.086, 90% CIs = 0.075, 0.098, SRMR = 0.055, power &gt;0.999, AIC = 39,484.669, BIC = 39,684.418), although model 3.2, with CHR symptoms as an outcome of SHR and PP, had lower BIC (BIC = 39,677.074, AIC = 39,485.825). Though the two models had a similarly good fit to the data, AIC was emphasized in model selection, being more relevant to our testing of a complex system of interactions with unknown underlying structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, and since BIC can lead to underfitting when working with large samples, non-nested models, and data not following a multivariate normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</p><p>In the community sample, maladaptive coping completely mediated the effect of maladaptive LOC on PP, SRH, and CHR symptoms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), and adaptive coping mediated the impact of competence beliefs, but not of adaptive LOC, on PP. Additionally, CHR symptoms partially mediated the effect of maladaptive coping on PP and SRH. No significant direct effects of competence beliefs and LOC on PP or SRH were detected.</p><p>In the sensitivity analysis, introducing sex as an exogenous variable in model 1.2 (Supplementary eFigure 8, Supplementary eTable 6) fit  a In the FETZ sample, 18 participants (4.8%) were missing data about their education level (ISCED), 30 participants (7.9%) were missing data about their SOFAS score, 26 participants (6.9%) were missing data about their GAF score, 85 participants (6.9%) were missing data about their current Axis-I disorders, 46 participants (12.2%) were missing data about their current CHR symptoms, 26 participants (6.9%) were missing data about their current UHR symptoms, 45 participants (11.9%) were missing data about their current basic symptoms.   to the community sample data and power were excellent across all indices (CFI = 0.989, TLI = 0.982, RMSEA = 0.04, 90% CIs = 0.027, 0.045, SRMR = 0.045, power &gt;0.999). Direct paths between the variables remained unaltered, but all mediation effects were insignificant. Competence beliefs newly showed a direct effect on PP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Association between core beliefs and MH outcomes</head><p>Our first hypothesis of a mediation by coping in the association between core beliefs and MH was partially supported by findings in the community sample. Aligning with the metanalytical model mostly generated on community samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, maladaptive coping completely mediated the effect of maladaptive LOC on CHR symptoms, PP, and SRH, while adaptive coping only mediated the association between competence beliefs and PP. While this suggests that treating maladaptive LOC and coping may promote MH in the community, the lack of mediation effects in the sensitivity model, that is, after the inclusion of sex, calls for more research into the role of sex in these associations.</p><p>Unexpectedly, but aligning with conflicting results in the two clinical samples of the metanalytical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, coping did not mediate the impact of core beliefs on MH in the clinical sample. Rather, adaptive and maladaptive beliefs were associated with their coping counterparts. Coping had direct effects on CHR symptoms, which were directly associated with MH outcomes. Newly, the total effects of maladaptive LOC and competence beliefs on CHR symptoms became significant, and competence beliefs were directly linked to SRH. A possible reason is that in clinical populations, both adaptive and maladaptive coping might specifically focus on CHR symptoms, rather than overall MH quality, as our results in the community sample suggest with lower rates of CHR symptoms. Therefore, treatment targeting coping strategies in these populations might help manage and reduce CHR symptoms, preventing maladaptive coping from acting as a trigger for CHR symptoms, exacerbating them, or worsening their outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Further, in light of our findings indicating a direct effect of competence beliefs on SRH, and of competence beliefs and LOC on coping, challenging maladaptive core beliefs may also have a positive impact on MH quality. In contrast to the metanalytical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we found no direct effects of LOC on MH outcomes. Possible explanations relate to differences in our study, including added complexity of our model with three MH variables and differing conceptualizations of MH (e.g., including measures of functioning in our study).</p><p>Results indicate the need for more group-dependent research on the impact of the severity of psychopathologyand possibly type and operationalization of psychopathologyon the association and potential mediation effects of core beliefs and coping strategies with MH, as different levels of engagement with the mental healthcare system might act as an additional mediator or moderator. Such future studies will shed light on the most relevant targets for promoting MH, that is, core beliefs, coping, or both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Role of CHR symptoms</head><p>To our knowledge, the present study was the first to explore CHR symptoms in the context of the interactions between core beliefs, coping, and MH, in both community and clinical samples. In the model selected as the best fit for the data, CHR symptoms were included as a contributor of MH outcome. However, the alternative model with CHR symptoms as an outcome of PP and SRH performed similarly well, indicating a strong association (albeit with unclear direction/placement) between MH variables and CHR in both samples, even after controlling for sex differences. Significant mediation effects of CHR symptoms in the relationship between coping and PP and SHR were found only in the community sample model disregarding sex but in no other model, possibly related to the cross-sectional nature of our study, preventing the drawing of definitive causal conclusions. Further factors that might help explain the differences between the community and clinical samples are (i) the differences in prevalence of CHR symptoms in the two samples, which may influence their role in relation to the other variables in our model as well as the results of our analyses; (ii) the impact of the additional burden of higher psychopathology and more severe functioning deficits in the clinical sample, which is generally more unwell compared to the community sample. Regardless, findings support some transdiagnostic relevance of CHR (regarding broader psychopathology and in relation to transdiagnostic factors) while simultaneously highlighting the challenge of accurately mapping CHR into broader psychopathological systems.</p><p>Aligning with earlier research on patients meeting UHR criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>, maladaptive coping was more strongly and frequently significantly associated with CHR symptoms compared to adaptive coping. Whereas adaptive coping styles were stable in UHR patients, maladaptive coping more likely changed over time and was related to corresponding changes in UHR symptoms in a UHR sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> and, in a community sample, was bidirectionally related over time to psychotic-like experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, which, however, may be a poor estimate of clinician-assessed CHR symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. With maladaptive coping also negatively impacting functioning and likely other clinical factors such as severity of symptomatology, including depression or personality traits, interventions that challenge coping strategiesand core beliefsmight be most appropriate for populations in early stages of mental disorders or with subclinical MH problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Strengths and limitations</head><p>The large size of both the community and clinical samples in this study and their separate analysis provide a comprehensive view of CHR symptoms and their associations with important transdiagnostic factors related to MH and some important first insights into the potential differences between community and clinical samples. Further, the assessment of MH variables in clinical interviews conducted by highly trained psychologists, and the comprehensive definition of CHR symptoms not only by UHR but also BS, adds to data validity.</p><p>The lack of control for ongoing psychotherapeutic treatment, which might have affected several variables, may be regarded as a limitation that our study shares with most comparable studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Moreover, despite growing evidence regarding their impact on CHR outcomes, especially on psychosocial functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>, we did not include negative CHR symptoms in our models, as they were only assessed in the clinical sample and, therefore, a meaningful comparison with the community sample would not have been possible. The role of psychotherapy and negative symptoms should be explored in future research.</p><p>Additionally, for reasons of sample size and power, we opted against recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> to only impute on variables missing &lt;5% of data but applied multiple imputation to the missing data to the SVF 120/KJ and EQ-5D-3L in the clinical sample as well, potentially constituting a statistical limitation. Furthermore, especially for the low number of participants meeting CHR criteria in the community sample (4.97%), we could not perform sensitivity analyses in CHR persons, limiting comparability with studies on CHR samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Lastly, as only the model with the lowest AIC an index that penalizes models less for free parameters and favors more saturated models compared to BICwas further processed; other possible relevant mediations, in particular PP and SRH in model 3.2 with the lowest BIC, remained unexplored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Future directions and conclusion</head><p>Our findings support evidence of community studies of a mediation role of coping in the relationship of MH variables with core beliefs, although this role might differ between sexes and may decrease with increasing MH problems. Results in the clinical sample suggest a more complex interplay of the examined variables compared to the community sample, thus indicating the need for more groupspecific analyses in future studies. Considering this and the higher severity of psychopathology and functioning deficits, treatment in this population may need to be more comprehensive and tailored to target multiple factors influencing MH outcomes, including coping strategies and core beliefs, to address the specific challenges faced by help-seeking individuals. Regarding CHR symptoms, a clear association with PP and, especially, SRH became evident in all models, with inconclusive results about their constellation. Future prospective studies should further examine the transdiagnostic factors coping and core beliefs, their relationship with CHR symptoms, and their emergence of manifest mental disorders. Overall, our results contribute to existing evidence that coping strategies, competence beliefs, and LOC represent worthwhile targets for the promotion of MH and shed further light on their complex interactions.</p><p>Supplementary material.
