<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We do not understand how neural nodes operate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions, nor how brain networks reconfigure during changing computational demands. Here, we record local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to "catch fireflies". This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop visual environment while concurrently computing latent variables: the evolving distance and angle to a memorized firefly. We observed mixed selectivity in all areas, with even a traditionally sensory area (MSTd) tracking latent variables. Strikingly, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling suggested a functional subnetwork between MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these areas and 7a, as anatomy would suggest. When sensory evidence was rendered scarce, lateral connectivity through neuron-to-neuron coupling within MSTd strengthened but its pattern remained fixed, while neuronal coupling adaptively remapped within 7a and dlPFC. The larger the remapping in 7a/dlPFC and the greater the stability within MSTd, the less was behavior impacted by loss of sensory evidence. These results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed-loop action-perception naturalistic behaviors and suggest internal models may be housed in the pattern of fine-grain lateral connectivity within parietal and frontal cortices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Despite the closed-loop interplay between action and perception that exists in the real world, our understanding of sensory encoding and the neural architectures supporting goal-directed behavior is largely derived from artificial tasks segregating perception from action. This limited purview of the traditional approach has hindered our ability to understand neural coding for naturalistic and dynamic behaviors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gomez-Marin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cisek &amp; Kalaska, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Pitkow &amp; Angelaki, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, Yoo et al., 2021, for similar arguments)</ref>.</p><p>First, severing the natural closed loop between action and perception disrupts the natural timing between sensory events and internal neural dynamics. In natural vision, for example, eye movements dictate the content, relative resolution, and timing of visual input. Recent work from active sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Schroeder et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yang et al., 2016)</ref> has shown that neural excitability in primary visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barczak et al., 2019)</ref> and the anterior nuclei of the thalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Leszczynski et al., 2020)</ref> are enhanced at saccade offset -precisely when new observations are made. This enhancement is mediated by phase-reset of neural oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lakatos et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rajkai et al., 2008)</ref> caused by the shifting gaze. In turn, it is likely that physical movements of the eyes during sensory processing -an aspect absent in most laboratory, binary decision-making tasks -may not only enhance lowlevel encoding, but also favor certain channels of inter-area communication via local field potential (LFP) phase alignment or other coupling mechanisms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jutras et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the emphasis on tasks with poor dynamics, together with a technology-limited focus on studying one area at a time, has limited our ability to explore how within-and cross-area communication enables flexible behavior. This has possibly led to a degeneracy in the number of functions ascribed to each neural node. For instance, redundancy has notoriously been observed between parietal and frontal cortices with both areas showing similar properties during visual feature categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Swaminathan &amp; Freedman, 2012)</ref>, target selection <ref type="bibr">(Suzuki &amp; Gotlieb, 2013)</ref>, visuo-spatial memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chafee &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1998)</ref> and working memory training <ref type="bibr">(Olesen et al., 2003)</ref>, among others (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Katsuki &amp; Constantinidis, 2012</ref>, for a review). While this redundancy is certainly an adaptive feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Moreno-Bote et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Driscoll et al., 2017)</ref>, the joint characterization of sensory, parietal, and frontal areas during tasks requiring a flow of cognitive operations typical of daily life (e.g., sensing, memorizing, acting) may offer the possibility to study how these regions differ, and how they interact.</p><p>Lastly, not only are single cognitive operations typically studied in isolation and in distinct and artificial temporal intervals, but they are also seldomly examined under different computational demands, e.g., from requiring the usage of incoming sensory evidence, vs. relying on pre-existing internal models. This focus on studying behaviors from a single computation perspective and requiring a fixed strategy is likely because asking overtrained animals to use diverse computational approaches in solving artificial tasks would require additional training on the second approach -a problem of over-fitting. This challenge is abated in naturalistic settings where fast across task generalization is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Noel et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>To tackle these limitations, we have developed a task requiring monkeys to catch memorized fireflies in virtual reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2020)</ref>. This goal-directed virtual navigation task addresses many of the limitations of the traditional approach, while being strongly rooted in established and well-understood elements: motion detection <ref type="bibr">(Newsome &amp; Pare, 1988)</ref>, optic flow processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Britten, 2008)</ref>, and navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kravitz et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Ekstrom et al., 2018)</ref>. Animals first detect a briefly flashed target, much like the blinking of a firefly. Then, they use a joystick controlling linear and angular velocity to navigate via path integration to the location of this target from memory (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Importantly, the observers' eyes are free to sample from their sensory surroundings, and trials last on the order of 3-4 seconds. In turn, this task requires integration of sensory evidence over protracted time periods, allows for active sensing, and engages the real-world loop between observations, beliefs, actions, and states (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Critically, the task-relevant variable (i.e., the relative position of the self to the target) is latent. It must be dynamically computed, and thus offers a window into the mechanisms of internal computation. Furthermore, by decreasing the density of ground-plane optic flow elements, we can shift the nature of the computation being performed; from relying on incoming sensory evidence to relying on an internal model of the physics of the environment and control dynamics.</p><p>Here, we leverage this "firefly task" to simultaneously characterize the encoding profiles of sensory (dorsomedial superior temporal area, MSTd), parietal (area 7a), and frontal (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC) areas during naturalistic, closed-loop visual behavior. We record local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity from this series of reciprocally connected areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andersen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rozzi et al., 2006)</ref> involved in the processing of optic flow for self-motion, sensorimotor transformations, and belief formation/working memory (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). We observe that all areas probed -including MSTd, an area classically considered sensory -encode latent task variables. Surprisingly, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit couplings suggest a functional subnetwork composed of dlPFC and MSTd (and not area 7a, as would be predicted from anatomy). When sensory information is reduced, changing the nature of the computation from sensory-driven to internal-model driven, area 7a and dlPFC dynamically remap their unit-to-unit connectivity, while MSTd coupling strengthens but it's fine-grain pattern remains unchanged. Strikingly, the degree to which MSTd remains stable, and the degree to which area 7a and dlPFC reconfigure correlates with changes in behavior. Overall, these findings highlight heterogenous subnetworks (not always predicted by anatomy) that adaptively reconfigure during changing computational demands to support goal-directed behavior in a dynamic environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monkeys navigate to remembered targets employing natural strategies</head><p>Targets ("fireflies") were displayed for 300ms, on a ground plane composed of triangular optic flow elements that appeared transiently (250ms) with random orientations. The standard density of these optic flow elements was 5 elements/m 2 . A single target was presented per trial. The firefly targets were uniformly distributed (across trials) within a radial range of 1 to 4m, and an angular disparity spanning from -40° (leftward) to 40° (rightward) of visual angle (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Performance feedback was provided at the end of each trial in the form of juice reward for correctly stopping within a reward boundary (see Methods for further detail).</p><p>Visualizing example trials shows that monkeys followed curvilinear trajectories and stopped near the latent targets (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). To quantify their performance, we expressed the monkeys' trajectory endpoints and firefly locations in polar coordinates, with an eccentricity from straight-ahead (𝜃𝜃) and a radial distance (𝑟𝑟). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> shows radial (top; 𝑟𝑟 vs. 𝑟𝑟̃ slope = 0.95; R 2 = 0.55) and angular (bottom; 𝜃𝜃 vs. 𝜃𝜃 � slope = 0.94; R 2 = 0.78) responses as a function of target location for an example session (omitting 18% of trials the animals aborted early or never stopped, see Methods). As shown by this example session, and confirmed across all three animals and all sessions (Monkey Q, 27 sessions; S, 38 sessions; M, 17 sessions; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>), monkeys were on average accurate, but tended to undershoot targets <ref type="bibr">(𝑟𝑟 vs. 𝑟𝑟̃ slope,</ref><ref type="bibr">Mean=0.842,</ref><ref type="bibr">95%CI=[0.830,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.854]</ref>; 𝜃𝜃 vs. 𝜃𝜃 � slope, M=0.772, 95%CI=[0.732, 0.812]). Undershooting targets is, in fact, the optimal strategy given that uncertainties over one's own and the firefly's position scales with time and distance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Over the course of individual trajectories toward the target, the monkeys' eye position moves downward and becomes less eccentric (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>), as if tracking the (invisible) target progressively becoming nearer and aligned with straight ahead <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2020</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ilg &amp; Thier, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2003)</ref>. This behavior was quantified by deriving predictions for the binocular position of the observer's eyes, assuming the monkeys maintained fixation at the center of the target throughout the trial. Then, we expressed a target tracking index as the square root of the fraction of variance in the observed eye position that was explained by the prediction (see <ref type="bibr">Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2020, for further detail)</ref>. An index of 1 implies that the subject consistently looked at the center of the firefly, while a value of zero denotes a complete lack of correspondence between target and gaze locations. The target-tracking index was high at firefly onset, highest at firefly offset, and remained above chance throughout the course of the trial (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref> shows an example session). Across all animals and sessions, the target-tracking index averaged 0.73 (95% CI=[0.72, 0.74]) during the first 1s of each trial, suggesting that all animals naturally fixated on the firefly, and attempted to maintain gaze on it even after the target had disappeared (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</p><p>Altogether, the animals can make use of the degrees of freedom afforded by the joystick to accumulate evidence over prolonged periods of time within a closed loop setting, and seemingly sample from their environment in an intelligent manner. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed selectivity across sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices</head><p>We recorded single-unit activity from MSTd (231 units), area 7a (3200 units), and dlPFC (823 units) in a total of 82 sessions while monkeys performed the firefly task (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Visual inspection of raw spike times suggested a putative coarse organization and area-specific features (e.g., high firing rates seemingly preceding stopping time in area 7a, black dots, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), but also displayed fine detail differences across trials and areas. To quantitatively and agnostically account for single unit encoding properties during this naturalistic, closed-loop task, we fit spike trains to a Poisson Generalized Additive model our group has previously developed (P-GAM; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balzani et al., 2020)</ref>. Beyond capturing arbitrary non-linearities and handling collinear predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dormann et al., 2013)</ref>, this particular encoding model has the strong advantage of inferring marginal confidence bounds for the contribution of each feature to neural responses (see <ref type="bibr">Balzani et al., 2020 for details)</ref>. This property allows us to robustly identify a minimal set of task features that each neuron is responsive to, while circumventing the need for computationally demanding model selection (particularly given the number and time-varying nature of the variables in this naturalistic task). Indeed, using model recovery we demonstrate that the P-GAM will capture the simplest possible interpretation of the neural responses in the statistical regime of our data, i.e., even when neurons are weakly firing and predictors are correlated (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>In addition to discrete task events (e.g., time of target onset, movement onset and offset), continuous sensorimotor variables (e.g., linear and angular velocity and acceleration) and latent parameters (e.g., distance from origin and to target), we included in the encoding model elements of brain dynamics. These included the phase of LFP in different frequency bands , and the coupling within (i.e., spike-history, 36 ms wide temporal filter) and between units, both within (36 ms wide temporal filter) and across cortical areas (600 ms wide temporal filters, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, see Methods). In total the model had 17 (analog or digital) task inputs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), in addition to hundreds of potential lateral and across region connections (i.e., coupling filters). The fitted model accounts well for observed spiking activity (see raw and model reconstructed spiking activity of simultaneously recorded units in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref> shows the tuning of an example MSTd (green), 7a (blue), and dlPFC (red) neuron. The striking feature of these example neurons is the fact that all units coded for a multitude of variables. For instance, each of these example neurons responded to the time of firefly and movement onset. The 7a neuron showed a strong dependency not only to sensorimotor and latent variables, but also to LFP phases (in all frequency ranges). Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, the MSTd neuron encoded not only sensorimotor and eye-position variables, but also latent ones, such as the angular distance to the (invisible) target. This mixed selectivity was true not only of the example neurons, but of each population as a whole (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref> shows 200 neurons from each area). In the Supplementary Materials (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3-S6</ref>) we depict all the different types (i.e., highdimensional clusters) of tuning functions that exist for the different task-variables in MSTd, area 7a, and dlPFC, thus creating what is akin to a set of 'words' composing the 'dictionary' available to each area in encoding taskrelevant features (see Methods for further detail).</p><p>Interestingly, while MSTd, area 7a, and dlPFC showed mixed selectivity within this naturalistic path integration task, the likelihood of being tuned to a particular variable, or a set of variables, was not random. As one would expect from more traditional, open-loop tasks, neurons in area 7a were tuned to a greater number of sensorimotor variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kravitz et al., 2011)</ref>, while units in dlPFC were tuned to a greater number of latent taskvariables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Duncan, 2001)</ref>, in this case the radial and angular distance from origin and to the target (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). Spiking activity in area 7a showed a marked dependence on its local LFP phase (79% of neurons being conjunctively tuned to theta, alpha, and beta phases), a feature that was much less frequent in MSTd and dlPFC. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref> confirms the above-mentioned observations, now depicted as the fraction of neurons tuned to each variable. In summary, encoding profiles during this closed action-perception loop largely followed general trends predicted in traditional open loop tasks, while also showing some stark novel features; the encoding of latent variables even in a traditionally considered sensory area (i.e., MSTd), and the very prominent dependence of spiking activity in area 7a (and not MSTd or dlPFC) on ongoing LFP phases. corresponding cross-validated prediction reconstructed from the P-GAM. The average cross-validated pseudo-R2 was 0.072 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cameron et al., 1997)</ref>. The direct comparison of the goodness-of-fit afforded by this method and those in other reports is difficulted by differences in neural areas and tasks, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balzani et al., (2020)</ref> for evidence of the superiority of the P-GAM with respect to traditional GLMs in synthetic data. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Benjamin et al., (2018)</ref> recently contrasted GLMs and techniques from modern machine learning in fitting spike trains across primary motor (M1), primary somatosensory (S1), and hippocampus. Even though neural responses in M1 and S1 are arguably simpler than those in <ref type="bibr">MSTd, 7a, and dlPFC, Benjamin et al. (2018)</ref> report cross-validated pseudo-R2 ranging from ~ 0.03 (for the GLM, and more than 2 times worse than our P-GAM in dlPFC) to ~0.09 (for neural networks, which is about equivalent to our method, particularly when considering the complexity of their areas and tasks, reaches). E. Example tuning functions to all the task variables and neural dynamics for a MSTd (green), 7a (blue) and dlPFC (red) neuron. Shaded areas are 95% posterior confidence intervals, and significant tuning (p&lt;0.01) are opaque, while non-significant (p&gt;0.01) tunings are transparent. F. Mask of significant tuning by variable (order is the same as in E, but vertical) and brain region for an example 200 units (x-axis). Significant tuning is colored, while non-significant is white. G.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cortical codes for path integration and vector-based navigation: asymmetric tiling of latent spaces</head><p>The crucial task-relevant variables in the firefly task are the relative angle and distance from self to target. These are latent, in that they are not directly observable by the monkey and must instead be dynamically computed based on immediate sensory experience. The encoding and updating of these spatial goals could take various forms. One suggested mechanism posits that the path toward spatial targets may be represented by activating a sequence of place cells (or more broadly, cells encoding self-position) from the target's location to the animal's current location <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ambrose et al., 2016)</ref>, or vice-versa, from one's location to the goal location <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pfeiffer &amp; Foster, 2013</ref>, also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhu et al., 2021</ref> for an analogous phenomenon in gaze patterns, where sequential eye movements sweeping forward trace the trajectory from self to (sub-)goal). This mechanism is difficult to probe here, given that we were not recording in the hippocampal formation. A (non-mutually exclusive) alternative is a vectorial representation of the goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Burgess &amp; O'Keefe, 1996)</ref>; an explicit encoding of the direction and distance to the target (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banino et al., 2018</ref>, for an intermediary solution, i.e., an artificial agent showing vectorbased navigation using grid-like codes). Indeed, Sarel and colleagues (2017) described units in the hippocampus (CA1) of bats that explicitly encoded the angular and radial distance to a target, even when this latter one was hidden (angular, 27%; radial, 16% of units). Here, we similarly observed units with a vectorial representation of spatial goals, even when targets are hidden and change position on a trial-by-trial basis. The angular distance to the hidden firefly was similarly frequent in MSTd (38.1%) and area 7a (34.1%), and approximately 10% more frequent than what is described in the bat's hippocampus. These neurons were twice as frequent in monkey dlPFC (53.6%) than bat hippocampus, and over half of the neurons recorded in dlPFC were tuned to the angular distance to target (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). Similarly, the distance to target was most commonly encoded in dlPFC (30.6%), yet are still more frequent in area 7a (21.7%) and MSTd (25.1%) than what has previously been reported in the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sarel et al., 2017)</ref>. Respectively 14.7%, 11.5%, and 20.5% of neurons in MSTd, 7a, and dlPFC, conjunctively encoded both the angular and radial distance to target -thus defining a particular spatial location in the environment relative to target. This is 1.53x, 1.53x, and 1.25x more frequent than what one would expect by chance (Chi-Square, all X 2 &gt; 9.9, p &lt; 0.002), suggesting that throughout sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices, the brain maintains a dynamic and explicit representation of (hidden) spatial goals relative to oneself.</p><p>The distribution of preferred angles and distances from origin (path integration) and to the target (vector-based navigation) are also informative. Each of these distributions spanned the entire range of angles and distances visited, demonstrating a full basis set covering the feature space (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>, distributions of preferred angle and distance from origin and to target in Monkey S).</p><p>Angles specifying a 0° offset from the heading at origin were over-represented (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>, top panel, proportions across all animals), while the 0° offset from target location was under-represented (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, second row). Instead, particularly in area 7a and dlPFC, the distribution of preferred angles to target was bimodal (bimodality coefficients, null = 0.55, MST = 0.57, 7a = 0.89, dlPFC = 0.80, 7a &amp; dlPFC p &lt; 0.05), with many neurons showing a preference for ~45-90° away from target, either leftward or rightward. This pattern is in stark contrast with observations from the bat's hippocampus, where a goal angle of 0° is over-represented <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sarel et al., 2017)</ref>. Speculatively, this reversed pattern of preferences between cortex and hippocampus may suggest that the former plays a role in guiding heading toward the desired state (akin to an error or correction signal), while the hippocampus maintains this heading.</p><p>In terms of radial distance, MSTd, area 7a, and dlPFC all showed an over-representation of units coding for distances near to, as opposed to far from, the starting location (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref> and B, 3 rd row, &lt; ~150cm). On the other hand, we observed a clear differentiation between cortical areas regarding their preferred distance to target. Paralleling observations from the bat's hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sarel et al., 2017)</ref>, area 7a showed a strong preference for nearby targets, though the absolute distances were very different. Approximately 50% of units coded for target distances within ~30cm (max = 400cm) in area 7a, while approximately 50% of units in the bat's hippocampus coded for distances within ~200cm (max = 1000cm). Neurons in MSTd and dlPFC responded primarily at intermediary and far distances to target (~200-400 cm from target; 3A and B, 4 rd row).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-cell properties and unit-to-unit coupling suggest two distinct functional sub-networks</head><p>To systematically examine how encoding of all task variables, and not solely a select few, varied across cortical areas, we employed a statistical clustering approach (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Minderer et al., 2019</ref>, for a similar approach).</p><p>First, we leveraged the knowledge of which variables each neuron was significantly tuned to (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>), and attempted clustering neurons based on this binary data, each neuron being defined by a size 17 binary vector (i.e., tuned or not tuned) corresponding to the 17 task variables defined in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref> shows the likelihood of neurons being tuned to any pair of variables (thresholded to a Jaccard Index &gt; 0.5 for visualization, see Methods) for an example monkey. This visualization illustrates a differing pattern between MSTd and dlPFC on one hand, often being jointly tuned to eye position, target onset, and the latent variables (particularly in dlPFC), and area 7a on the other hand, being frequently jointly tuned to all sensorimotor variables and the phase of LFP bands. Most notably, clustering based on these 17-dimensional binary vectors (see Methods) showed that nearly all MSTd (89%) and dlPFC (94%) neurons were categorized as belonging within the same cluster (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>, cluster number 1), one that was defined by true mixed selectivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>, top left). In contrast, area 7a neurons appeared in three distinct clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>, cluster numbers 1-3, respectively, 36%, 22%, and 31%). Cluster 2 was characterized by a strong selectivity for sensorimotor variables and firing in alignment with specific LFP phases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>, top center), while Cluster 3 was characterized by a near complete lack of tuning to latent variables and eye position (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>, top right). Other cluster types existed, for instance composed of neurons selectively tuned to the ongoing phase in LFP bands but no other task variable (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, Cluster 4), or driven also by motor onset and offset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, Cluster 5). These remaining clusters were, however, less common (1-5%). Together, this pattern of clustering results based on whether or not neurons were tuned to different task variables demonstrates a surprising commonality between MSTd and dlPFC, which are in turn different from area 7a.</p><p>Next, we questioned whether utilizing knowledge of the shape of these tuning functions (as opposed to simply whether or not tuning to a variable was significant) would dissociate between neurons in each area. Tuning functions for all task variables of a given neuron were stacked, then all neurons were projected onto a low dimensional manifold via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McInnes et al., 2020)</ref>, and clustered on this projection via DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ester et al., 1996)</ref>. Area 7 and dlPFC neatly segregated from one another, while neurons from MSTd could be found along a continuum from area 7a to dlPFC. Notably, however, the centroid of MSTd was 6.49 times closer to the centroid of dlPFC than area 7a (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4D</ref>, top row. Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Becht et al., 2018</ref>, have shown UMAP to conserve global structure and thus allows for a meaningful interpretation of distances). Similarly, DBSCAN clustering highlighted 3 main clusters within this low dimensional projection of tuning functions. Cluster 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4D</ref>, second row) contained 81.5% of all dlPFC neurons, 58.9% of all MSTd neurons, and 3.6% of all neurons from 7a. Clusters 2 and 3 exclusively contained neurons from area 7a (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4D</ref>, third and fourth row). Thus, just as the clustering based on whether or not neurons were tuned to different variables, clustering based on tuning shapes also highlighted a stronger similarity in the encoding properties of MSTd and dlPFC, as opposed to either of the former and area 7a (see Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref> for UMAP projections color coded by the mutual information between neural responses and a particular task variable). Given the surprising similarity in encoding profiles across MSTd and dlPFC, we next examined inter-area global synchronization and unit-to-unit coupling, in an attempt to question whether these two areas form an interacting sub-network. We examined inter-area coordination both from the standpoint of coarse grain LFP-to-spike phase locking, and via finer unit-to-unit couplings as estimated from the P-GAM.</p><p>As stated earlier (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), we found a very strong phase-locking of spiking in area 7a neurons to ongoing LFP phase within the same area, across theta, alpha, and beta bands (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>, blue self-connecting arrows). Phase-locking of spikes in dlPFC were more common in the higher (i.e., beta), rather than lower frequency bands, while phase locking in MSTd neurons remained constant across LFP bands. More importantly, spiking activity in some units was also well explained by the ongoing LFP phase in different regions (above and beyond the ongoing LFP phase in their local area). Most notably, 37% of neurons in dlPFC were tuned to the ongoing LFP phase within the beta range in 7a. An even greater proportion of units showed the reciprocal property, with 59% of neurons in area 7a being modulated by the ongoing phase of beta-band LFP in dlPFC. A considerable proportion of 7a units were also modulated by the ongoing phase of alpha-band LFP in MSTd (24%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). Globally, therefore, phase locking of spiking activity to LFP in different areas reflected the known anatomical connections, with reciprocal projections between MSTd and 7a, as well as between 7a and dlPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andersen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rozzi et al., 2006)</ref>. Similarly, the putative "feedback" influence from dlPFC to area 7a (potentially reflecting the "belief" guiding motor action) was stronger than the putative "feedforward" influence of 7a onto dlPFC. Most noteworthily, however, there was no strong LFP-to-spike phase-locking between dlPFC and MSTd (the strongest influence between these being 12% of neurons in MSTd phase-locking to theta band LFP from dlPFC).</p><p>Finer grain unit-to-unit coupling was sparse, and within each area the probability of two units being functionally connected decreased as a function of the distance between neurons (Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>). The overall likelihood of two units within a given area being coupled changed as a function of brain area. There were more units coupled in MSTd (13%, corrected for distance between electrodes, see Methods) and area 7a (22%) than in dlPFC (7%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>), potentially reflecting an increase in the dimensionality of the neural code (i.e., decrease in redundancy) as we move from sensorimotor areas to cognitive areas. More importantly, the across area unit-tounit coupling did not reflect global anatomical trends, and instead supported the functional association between MSTd and dlPFC, as also suggested by the encoding profiles of these areas. Twelve percent of neurons in dlPFC were coupled to activity in MSTd, while 7% of neurons in MSTd were coupled to activity in dlPFC. Importantly, neither of these regions showed either a "feedforward" or "feedback" likelihood of being coupled with area 7a that exceeded 4% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>).</p><p>Four arguments support the fact that unit-to-unit coupling as estimated by the P-GAM reflect a neural property beyond and orthogonal to global volume-conductance or spurious noise correlations. First, they significantly improve fits of the encoding model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5C</ref> shows the cross-validated pseudo-R 2 for the encoding model, including all task variables, LFP phases, and unit-to-unit coupling ("coupled model", y-axis), relative to a reduced model lacking the unit-to-unit coupling ("uncoupled model", x-axis. Also see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5D</ref>). Second, the likelihood of two units within a given area being coupled was not random or purely depending on their physical distance, but instead varied as a function of tuning similarity. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5E</ref> shows that the more similar the tuning functions were between two neurons, the more like these were to be coupled. The P-GAM was able to reflect this wellestablished "like-to-like connectivity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cossell et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chettih &amp; Harvey, 2019)</ref>, even for latent variables, and even in MSTd. Third, inter-area coupling filters did not show oscillatory behavior. Instead of sinusoidal patterns, we frequently observed gradual increases or decreases in the likelihood of the examined neuron to spike given the activity of another neurons (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S9</ref> for a 'dictionary' of coupling filters across areas and their relative frequency). Lastly, the fact that our estimated cross-region unit-to-unit couplings are not likely to reflect a more global and unaccounted for correlation between areas is supported by the fact that while units phase-locked to the LFP in a different region were very likely to be phase locked to LFP in their own area (reflecting the utility of LFPs in coordinating spiking activity across areas), there was no significant change in the likelihood of coupled vs. uncoupled units to be phased locked to LFPs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S10</ref>).</p><p>Altogether, both encoding profiles and fine grain unit-to-unit coupling across areas suggests that while the anatomical connectivity suggests a hierarchy from MSTd to area 7a to dlPFC, functionally and within this closedloop virtual navigation task, MSTd and dlPFC form a subnetwork that is distinct from 7a. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remapping of unit-to-unit coupling in 7a and dlPFC, and strengthening of connections in MSTd, during internal-model driven navigation</head><p>To further understand the role of each putative functional unit (MSTd and dlPFC on one hand, and 7a on another), we introduced an experimental manipulation changing the nature of the computation being performed. On a subset of randomly interleaved trials, the standard optic flow density (5 elements/m 2 ) was decreased by a factor of 50. In this novel condition, the monkeys could not rely on incoming sensory evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alefantis et al., 2021)</ref>, and instead had to use their internal model of the mapping between joystick position and their velocity in the virtual environment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>).</p><p>Compared to the high-density condition, during low-density optic flow monkeys further undershot targets (p = 5.32x10 -17 ), and their precision worsened (p = 0.005, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2020</ref>, for a similar observation). This is precisely the pattern of results expected, given that observers are trying to maximize the overlap between their inferred position and that of the firefly. The observer's uncertainty of their own position grows over time/space (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), and thus their expectation of reward peaks at earlier distances under greater self-position uncertainty (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2018</ref>, for formal behavioral modelling and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref> for corroborative evidence showing that monkey's uncertainty over space scales quicker with time/space in the low-rather than high-density condition).</p><p>To quantify the effect of the change in optic-flow density (and presumably from sensory-driven to internal-model driven computation) on neural tuning curves, we computed the correlation between the tuning functions estimated by the P-GAM in each of these conditions. The slope of this correlation quantifies a change in gain in the neural responses (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S12</ref> for example tuning functions in both optic flow conditions, as well as their gain modulation). While we observed significant gain modulation in all brain regions (all p &lt;0.005), the effect size was considerable in MSTd (Cohen's d = 0.21) and negligible in the other areas (e.g., Cohen's d = 0.06 in area 7a). Responses were less prominent in MSTd (i.e., gains &lt; 1) during the low-density condition, while the opposite was true for area 7a and dlPFC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6C</ref>). Interestingly, as if attempting to offset the impact of the unavailability of sensory evidence, the strength of coupling filters within MSTd increased during the low-density manipulation (p&lt;0.005, paired t-test, Cohen's d= 0.51, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6D</ref>). A similar observation has been reported in primary visual cortex, where the amplitude of LFP waves increases with decreased visual stimulus contrast, suggesting that lateral connections in sensory areas dominate when sensory evidence is weak <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nauhaus et al., 2009)</ref>. In contrast, the strength of coupling filters within area 7a and dlPFC were unchanged in the low vs. high optic-flow density conditions (Cohen's d &lt; 0.06, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6D</ref>). The probability of unit-to-unit coupling, either within (all p&gt;0.65) or across areas (all p&gt;0.24, with one exception with negligible effect size, Cramer-V &lt; 0.03), did not change between the different optic flow conditions.</p><p>Beyond the strength of neural responses, and the strength and probability of coupling filters, we may also index the shape of these coupling filters. As above, for all three areas we performed a correlation between the coupling filters in both conditions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6E</ref> shows the cumulative density function of the correlation coefficients for each area. In diametrical contrast to the coupling strength results, here we found that the parietal and frontal areas flexibly remapped from one condition to another, while MSTd remained fixed (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.002; posthoc Holm-Sidak corrected, MSTd vs. 7a, p = 0.003; MSTd vs. dlPFC, p = 0.02; 7a vs. dlPFC, p = 0.76; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6E</ref>). This is the first result where instead of MSTd and dlPFC showing a strong association (showing similar encoding profiles and across-area unit-to-unit coupling), we have area 7a and dlPFC showing a flexible remapping of unit-to-unit coupling, while MSTd coupling filters remain fixed yet strengthened. This latter result, with the traditionally considered sensory area showing inflexibility, is reminiscent of work suggesting that population coupling is invariant to stimulus conditions in visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Okun et al. 2015)</ref>. Together with the current results, we may speculate that while sensory cortices generally show a fixed coupling pattern, higherorder areas flexibly reconfigure according to task demands. Estimating the flexibility or lack thereof of coupling filters across areas and density conditions was not possible due to their relatively low occurrence.</p><p>Finally, for sessions with both optic flow conditions and showing a minimum of 5 units coupled with another unit, we performed a correlation between the monkey's change in radial bias (slope, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6F</ref>) and precision (R 2 , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6E</ref>) between low-and high-density environments, and the average stability of their unit-to-unit coupling (averaged within each brain region and session). Regarding radial bias, we found a strong correlation in area 7a (R 2 = 0.27, p = 7.7x10 -5; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6F</ref>), indicating that the more the coupling filters changed in this area (i.e., the smaller the correlations coefficients on average), the less was accuracy impacted by the lack of sensory evidence. In other words, given that accuracy in trajectory endpoints were less accurate under the low rather than high optic-flow density condition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>), this result suggests that the more units in 7a remapped, the less behavior suffered from the decreased availability of sensory evidence. There was no relation between the stability of unit-to-unit coupling in MSTd or dlPFC and changes in behavioral accuracy (all R 2 &lt; 0.05 and all p &gt; 0.14).</p><p>Regarding the precision of radial endpoints (i.e., the change in R 2 during high and low optic flow conditions), we found a negative correlation with the stability of unit-to-unit coupling in MSTd (R 2 = 0.33, p = 0.005), and a positive one with the stability in dlPFC (R 2 = 0.12, p = 0.05; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6G</ref>). In other words, the more stable was the unit-to-unit coupling in MSTd, the less stable it was in dlPFC, the less was behavioral precision impacted by the loss of incoming sensory evidence. The individual nodes in the network formed by MSTd and dlPFC, thus, seemingly play different roles: the sensory area attempts to maximize a fixed signal, while dlPFC flexibly reconfigures according to task demands. There was no relation between the stability of unit-to-unit coupling in area 7a and changes in behavioral precision (R 2 = 0.01, p = 0.26).</p><p>Together, this pattern of results suggests that when incoming sensory evidence became scarce, neurons in the sensory region strengthened their lateral connections, but did not change their fine grain pattern of connectivity. On the other hand, area 7a and dlPFC remapped their fine grain unit-to-unit coupling, and the more they were able to do so, the less was behavioral accuracy (for 7a) and precision (for dlPFC) impacted by the loss of incoming sensory evidence. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The lion's share of our understanding linking spiking activity to goal-directed behavior originates from tasks that bear little resemblance to real world self-environment interactions. Major differences include the prevalence of closed loops between action and perception in natural behaviors, as well as the necessity to concurrently accomplish multiple sensory and cognitive operations over protracted periods of time (e.g., navigating while keeping in mind a target; see <ref type="bibr">Sosa &amp; Giacomo, 2021</ref>, for a recent review on the topic, yet with an exclusive focus on rodents and the hippocampal formation). To establish how the brain operates under these naturalistic conditions, and examine how neural dynamics change with changing computational demands, we recorded simultaneously from three cortical areas (MSTd, 7a, and dlPFC) while non-human primates detected a target, remembered its location within 2-dimensional space, and path integrated to it by actively sampling from and acting on their environment. We focus on the encoding profiles of single-units and describe four main findings.</p><p>First, we found that all task variables were present across all brain areas probed. This multiplexing, however, was patterned. The prefrontal cortex showed the greatest proportion of neurons tuned to latent variables, posterior parietal cortex showed a strong selectivity for sensorimotor variables and the ongoing phase of LFPs, and MSTd was prominently tuned to eye position. Most notoriously, even MSTd, an area typically considered a sensory node, showed a considerable number of neurons encoding latent variables, such as the angle or radial distance from origin and to target. In fact, the global encoding profile of MSTd was strikingly akin to that of dlPFC, suggesting this area is not purely sensory (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mendoza et al., 2014</ref> for a similar observation).</p><p>The second major finding relates to functional organization across the MSTd, 7a, dlPFC network. Anatomical tracer studies suggest a distributed hierarchy, with recurrent connections between MSTd and 7a, and then recurrent connections between 7a and dlPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andersen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rozzi et al., 2006)</ref>. As expected from anatomy, here we observed that spiking activity in 7a is influenced by LFP fluctuations in MSTd (particularly in the alpha range). In turn, spiking activity in dlPFC and 7a are influenced by LFP fluctuations, respectively, in 7a and dlPFC (particularly in the beta range). In other words, we observe that the coarse channels of communication riding on LFPs are in line with anatomy. However, in contrast to an anatomy-based hypothesis that MSTd signals reach dlPFC through area 7a, we observe a likelihood of MSTd neurons being coupled to dlPFC, and of dlPFC neurons being coupled to MSTd, that is, respectively, 3 and almost 2 times as large as coupling among either of these areas with 7a. These results suggest that despite the lack of direct anatomical connections, MSTd and dlPFC may form a functional subnetwork within this closed-loop path integration task. The area or areas that functionally link MSTd and dlPFC is at present unknown, but it is not area 7a.</p><p>Third, sensory, parietal and frontal cortices re-organize differently during changing computational demands. More precisely, when sensory evidence became scarce, and thus the animal had to largely rely on their internal models, we uncovered what resembles a two-pronged process. First, the tuning curves of the sensory area were impacted by the lack of sensory evidence: decreasing their gain but not changing in overall shape. And as if attempting to compensate for this, the lateral connectivity within MSTd strengthened. However, the connectivity pattern -the shape of coupling filters -remained relatively fixed and did not adapt to the changing environment. On the other hand, the connectivity strength of coupling filters was unchanged within parietal and frontal areas, yet their patterns flexibly remapped. Strikingly, the less the sensory area remapped, and the more the prefrontal and parietal cortices did, the less was behavior impacted by the loss of sensory evidence. Speculatively, this two-pronged approach, with diverging patterns in the remapping of unit-to-unit coupling among "sensory" and "cognitive" areas, may allow for a compromise between faithfully reflecting our sensory environment and not completely changing our interpretation of the world around us given small, stochastic, fluctuations. In other words, the "sensory" area, showing a fixed connectivity pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Okun et al. 2015)</ref> that is gain-modulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nauhaus et al., 2009)</ref> may allow maximizing our encoding capacity. On the other hand, it is possible that our internal models of the environment are housed in the precise connectivity within "cognitive" areas.</p><p>Lastly, we found that MSTd, area 7a, and dlPFC all show evidence for vector-based coding of spatial goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sarel et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, also see Ekstrom et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, and Gauthier &amp; Tank, 2018</ref>, for similar evidence in humans and rodents). Interestingly, we observed that area 7a showed a majority of neurons coding for locations near the origin or near the target. That is, 7a is likely involved in body-centered state transitions (e.g., from static to moving) and approaching behavior (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Medendorp &amp; Heed, 2019</ref> for a similar argument and Serino, 2019, for a review on the role of posterior parietal cortex in peri-personal space encoding). dlPFC, on the other hand (and to a lesser extent MSTd), showed a preponderance of units coding for locations near the origin and far from the target. Interestingly, human fMRI work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Howard et al, 2014)</ref> has suggested that the posterior hippocampus encodes path distance to goals, while the anterior hippocampus encodes a more abstract Euclidian distance. Together with the current findings, and the fact that anterior and posterior hippocampus respectively project to the prefrontal and parietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Strange et al., 2014)</ref>, suggests that a circuit including the anterior hippocampus and prefrontal cortex may abstractly plan goal-directed trajectories, while a circuit including the posterior hippocampus and parietal cortex may compute the body-centric sensorimotor affordances.</p><p>The fact that all areas probed showed a preference for distances near (as opposed to far) from where the monkey started path integrating (i.e., the origin) may suggest a change in the computations undertaken early vs. late within a trajectory. Namely, early on observers may compute their ongoing distance from the origin, and then switch to computing distance not from origin, but from the target. This switch from first coding displacement to then coding location relative to a target has been previously suggested empirically <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gothard et al., 1996)</ref> and in recent computational accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kanitscheider &amp; Fiete, 2017)</ref>. The full account will be best probed by future studies examining population dynamics within different periods of a single trajectory.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate what may be broad principles of brain computation during closed actionperception loops: (i) mixed yet patterned single cell selectivity, (ii) fine grain connectivity between task relevant areas (i.e., MSTd, during our optic flow task) and pre-frontal cortex, and (iii) a dynamic strengthening (in "sensory" areas) and remapping (in "cognitive" areas) of lateral connectivity as our environments require a heavier weighting on internal models vis-à-vis sensory evidence (e.g., navigating our homes at night). Together, these insights demonstrate the power of studying brain function within a scenario akin to that it evolved to solve.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals and Animal Preparation</head><p>We recorded extracellularly from areas MSTd, area 7a, and dlPFC in 3 adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca Mulatta; 9.8-13.1kg). We collected behavioral and neural data from 27 recording sessions from monkey Q, 38 sessions from monkey S, and 17 sessions from monkey M. All animals were chronically implanted with a lightweight polyacetal ring for head restraint. Further, for acute recordings, animals were outfitted with a removable grid to guide electrode penetrations. For eye-tracking, a subset of monkeys (Monkey Q) were implanted with scleral coils (CNC Engineering, Seattle WA, USA), while eye tracking was performed using a video-based system (ISCAN Inc. Woburn, USA) in the remaining animals (Monkeys S and M). Monkeys were trained using standard operant conditioning procedures to use a joystick to navigate in virtual reality (VR) and stop at the location of briefly presented targets, "fireflies". All surgeries and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine and New York University, and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Setup</head><p>Monkeys were head-fixed and secured in a primate chair. A 3-chip DLP projector (Christie Digital Mirage 2000, Cypress, CA, USA) rear-projected images onto a 60 x 60 cm screen that was attached to the front of the field coil frame, ~ 30 cm in front of the monkey. The projector rendered stereoscopic images generated by an OpenGL accelerator board (Nvidia Quadro FX 3000G). To navigate, the animals used an analog joystick (M20U9T-N82, CTI electronics) with two degrees of freedom to control their linear and angular speeds in a virtual environment. This virtual world comprised a ground plane whose textural elements had limited lifetime (250 ms) to avoid serving as landmarks. The ground plane was circular with a radius of 70 m (near and far clipping planes at 5 cm and 40 m respectively), with the subject positioned at its center at the beginning of each trial. Each texture element was an isosceles triangle (base x height: 8.5 x 18.5 cm 2 ) that was randomly repositioned and reoriented at the end of its lifetime, making it impossible to use as a landmark. The maximum linear and angular speeds were fixed to 2 m/s and 90 deg/s. The standard density of the ground plane was 5.0 elements/m 2 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). This density was reduced by a factor of 50 (0.1 elements/m 2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>) in a manipulation condition, to force the animals to use their acquired internal model, rather than sensory evidence. All stimuli were generated and rendered using C++ Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) by continuously repositioning the camera based on joystick inputs to update the visual scene at 60 Hz. The camera was positioned at a height of 0.1 m above the ground plane. Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was used to record and store the timeseries of target and animal's location, animal linear and angular velocity, as well as eye positions. All behavioral data were recorded along with the neural event markers at a sampling rate of 833.33Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Task</head><p>Monkeys steered to a target location (circular disc of radius 20 cm) that was cued briefly (300ms) at the beginning of each trial. Each trial was programmed to start after a variable random delay (truncated exponential distribution, range: 0.2 -2.0 s; mean: 0.5 s) following the end of the previous trial. The target appeared at a random location between -40 to 40 deg of visual angle, and between 1 and 4 m relative to where the subject was stationed at the beginning of the trial. The joystick was always active, and thus monkeys were free to start moving before the target vanished, or before it appeared. Monkeys typically performed blocks of 750 trials before being given a short break. In a session, monkeys would perform 2 or 3 blocks. Feedback, in the form of juice reward was given following a variable waiting period after stopping (truncated exponential distribution, range: 0.1 -0.6 s; mean: 0.25 s). They received a drop of juice if their stopping position was within 0.6 m away from the center of the target. No juice was provided otherwise. Monkeys were first trained extensively, gradually reducing the size of the reward zone until their performance stopped improving.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Recording and Pre-Processing</head><p>We recorded extracellularly, either acutely using a 24-channel linear electrode array (100 µm spacing between electrodes; U-Probe, Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX, USA; MSTd in Monkey Q and S, and dlPFC in monkey M) or chronically with multi-electrode arrays (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; 96 electrodes in area 7a in Monkey Q, and 48 electrodes in both area 7a and dlPFC in monkey S). During acute recordings with the linear arrays, the probes were advanced into the cortex through a guide-tube using a hydraulic microdrive. Spike detection thresholds were manually adjusted separately for each channel to facilitate real-time monitoring of action potential waveforms. Recordings began once waveforms were stable. The broadband signals were amplified and digitized at 20 KHz using a multichannel data acquisition system (Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX, USA) and were stored along with the action potential waveforms for offline analysis. Additionally, for each channel, we also stored low-pass filtered (-3dB at 250Hz) local-field potential (LFP) signals. For the array recordings, broadband neural signals were amplified and digitized at 30 KHz using a digital headstage (Cereplex E, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), processed using the data acquisition system (Cereplex Direct, Blackrock Microsystems) and stored for offline analysis. Additionally, for each channel, we also stored low-pass filtered (-6 dB at 250 Hz) local-field potential (LFP) signals sampled at 500 Hz. Finally, copies of event markers were received online from the stimulus acquisition software (Spike2) and saved alongside the neural data.</p><p>Spike detection and sorting were initially performed on the raw (broadband) neural signals using KiloSort 2.0 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Pachitariu et al., 2016)</ref> on an NVIDIA Quadro P5000 GPU. The software uses a template matching algorithm both for detection and clustering of spike waveforms. The spike clusters produced by KiloSort were visualized in Phy2 and manually refined by a human observer, by either accepting or rejecting KiloSort's label for each unit. In addition, we computed three isolation quality metrics; inter-spike interval violations (ISIv), waveform contamination rate (cR), and presence rate (PR). ISIv is the fraction of spikes that occur within 1ms of the previous spike. cR is the proportion of spikes inside a high-dimensional cluster boundary (by waveform) that are not from the cluster (false positive rate) when setting the cluster boundary at a Mahalanobis distance such that there are equal false positives and false negatives. PR is 1 minus the fraction of 1 minute bins in which there is no spike. We set the following thresholds in qualifying a unit as a single-unit: ISIv &lt; 20%, cR &lt; 0.02, and PR &gt; 90%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavior</head><p>The location of targets and monkey's endpoints were expressed in polar coordinates, with a radial distance (target = 𝑟𝑟, response = 𝑟𝑟) and eccentricity from straight ahead (target = 𝜃𝜃; response = 𝜃𝜃 � ). On a subset of trials (~13%) animals stopped after &lt;0.5m (range of targets, 1m to 4m). Similarly, on a subset of trials (~5%) animals did not stop during the course of a trial (max duration = 7 seconds). These trials were discarded before further behavioral analyses. As we have observed before <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lakshminarasimhan et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Noel et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Noel et al., , 2021) )</ref> a linear model with multiplicative gain accounted well for the observed data (average R 2 = 0.72). Thus, we used the slopes of the corresponding linear regressions as a measure of bias. Note that in this scheme a slope of one indicates no bias, while slopes smaller than one indicate undershooting (either in radial or angular distance).</p><p>To account for greater undershooting apparent in the low-density optic flow condition, we examined the scaling of uncertainty with distance to the target. Low-and high-density trials were discretized in equal size quartiles by radial distance (i.e., 4 different distances). Within each quartile, we computed the standard deviation of the radial responses. As expected, variance increased with distance. Importantly, we were particularly interested in whether the scaling of uncertainty with distance was greater in the low density vs. high density condition. Thus, we expressed the ratio between these (low density standard deviation divided by high density standard deviation), and examined this quantity as a function of distance. The fact that this ratio increases over space (from ~1 to ~1.2, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>) shows that uncertainty over position scales quicker in the low rather than the high optic flow density condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Poisson Generalized Additive Model</head><p>The Poisson Generalized Additive Model (P-GAM; <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/savin-lab">https://github.com/savin-lab</ref>) defines a non-linear mapping between spike counts of a unit 𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 ∈ ℕ 0 (binned at 6ms temporal resolution) and a set of continuous covariates 𝒙𝒙 𝑡𝑡 (angular and linear velocity and acceleration, angular and linear distance traveled, angular and linear distance to target, and LFP instantaneous phase across different frequency ranges), and discrete events 𝒛𝒛 𝑡𝑡 (time of movement onset/offset, target onset, reward delivery, and the spike counts from simultaneously recorded units). In particular, the unit log-firing rate is modeled as a linear combination of arbitrary non-linear functions of the covariates,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log 𝜇𝜇 = ∑ 𝑓𝑓 𝑗𝑗 �𝑥𝑥 𝑗𝑗 � + ∑ 𝑓𝑓 𝑘𝑘 * 𝑧𝑧 𝑘𝑘 𝑘𝑘 𝑗𝑗 (Eq. 1)</formula><p>where * is the convolution operator, and the unit spike counts are generated as Poisson random variables with rate specified by (Eq. 1).</p><p>Input specific non-linearities 𝑓𝑓(⋅) are expressed in terms of flexible B-splines, 𝑓𝑓(⋅) ≈ 𝜷𝜷 ⋅ 𝒃𝒃(⋅) and are associated with a smoothness enforcing penalization term controlled by a scale parameter 𝜆𝜆 𝑓𝑓 , 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃�𝑓𝑓, 𝜆𝜆 𝑓𝑓 � = -1 2 𝜆𝜆 𝑓𝑓 𝜷𝜷 𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆 𝑓𝑓 𝜷𝜷, 𝑆𝑆 𝑓𝑓 = ∫ 𝑏𝑏 ′′ ⋅ 𝑏𝑏 ′′ 𝑇𝑇 d𝑥𝑥 (Eq. 2)</p><p>The larger 𝜆𝜆 𝑓𝑓 , the smoother the model.

Both parameters 𝜷𝜷 and the hyperparameters 𝝀𝝀 are learned from the data by an iterative optimization procedure that switches between maximizing Eq. 3 as a function of the parameters, and minimizing a cross-validation score as a function of the hyperparameters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balzani et al., 2020</ref> for further details).</p><p>The probabilistic interpretation of the penalization terms allowed us to compute a posterior distribution for the model parameters, derive confidence intervals with desirable frequentist coverage properties, and implement a statistical test for input variable inclusion that selects a minimal subset of variables explaining most of the variance. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> we demonstrate that this approach will appropriately select variables contributing to the spike trials of individual neurons. Further, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S13</ref> we show that including all variables in the model (thousands of parameters, given the cell-to-cell coupling) does not outperform the selected model, which has an order of magnitude less parameters. The approach circumvents traditional model-comparison-based variable selection, which would be unfeasible in a fully coupled model with hundreds of covariates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pseudo-R 2</head><p>Fit quality was assessed via the pseudo-R 2 on subset of held-out test trials (20% of the total trials, not used for inferring model parameters). Pseudo-R 2 is a goodness of fit measure that is suitable for models with Poisson observation noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cameron et al., 1997)</ref>. The score is computed as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">pseudo 𝑅𝑅 2 = 1 - ℒ(𝒚𝒚)-ℒ( 𝒚𝒚 �) ℒ(𝒚𝒚)-ℒ( 𝒚𝒚 �) (Eq. 4)</formula><p>with ℒ(𝒚𝒚) the likelihood of the true spike counts, ℒ( 𝒚𝒚 �) the likelihood of the P-GAM model prediction and ℒ( 𝒚𝒚 �) the likelihood of a Poisson null-model (constant mean rate). It can be interpreted as the fraction of the maximum possible likelihood (normalized by the null-model) that the fit achieves. The score is 0 when the GAM fits are no more likely than the null model, 1 when it perfectly matches the data, and rarely can be negative (for test-set data, 3% of the recorded units) when overfitting occurs. In this latter case we excluded the unit from analysis. Empirically, the pseudo-R 2 is a stringent metric and ranges in values that are lower than the standard R 2 when both are applicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Domencich et al., 1975)</ref> and depends on the firing statistics of the area recorded (such as mean firing rates and variance), the type of covariates, and their number <ref type="bibr">(Benjamin et al., 2017)</ref>.

Within area coupling filters were set to a duration of 36ms, and across area filters were set to a duration of 600ms. For the within area coupling probability reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>, we corrected for the effects of unit distance (i.e., Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) by first fitting a brain region-specific logistic regression.

Coupling strength (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6D</ref>) was computed as the area under the filter. Coupling stability (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6E</ref>) was computed as the correlation between coupling filters in the low-and high-density condition. Chance and ceiling levels were established by permutation. To relate the change in within area connectivity with the change in behavior caused by the decrease in optic flow signals, we computed the average coupling stability per area and session, given at least 5 connected units and a P-GAM pseudo-r^2 &gt; 0.01.    <ref type="bibr">UMAP (McInnes et al., 2020)</ref> projection space color coded by mutual information with each task variable.

Neurons who were tuned to the LFP in a different area (dark blue), were significantly more likely to be tuned to the LFP in their own area (left column) than neurons that were not tuned to the phase of LFP in another area (light blue). On the other hand, whether units were coupled or not with neurons in another area (uncoupled in light blue and coupled in dark blue) did not impact their likelihood of being tuned to the ongoing phase of LFPs in their own area (right column).

A. Fraction of neurons whose spiking activity is phase-locked to LFP phases within its own area (self-connecting arrows) and to that of other areas, in theta (leftmost), alpha (center) and beta (rightmost) bands. An arrow projecting from e.g., MSTd to 7a (center, 0.24), indicates that the neuron in area 7a is influenced by ongoing LFP phase in MSTd. Width of arrows and associated number indicate the proportion of neurons showing the particular property. B. As A. but for unit-to-unit coupling. An arrow projecting from e.g., MSTd to dlPFC indicates that the firing of a neuron in MSTd will subsequently influence spiking activity in dlPFC. C. Cross-validated pseudo-R 2 of the full encoding model (y-axis) and a reduced model without within and across area unit-to-unit coupling (x-axis). D. Probability distribution of the change in pseudo-R 2 from the reduced to the full model. E. Coupling probability (C.P.) between any two units given their tuning similarity to sensorimotor, latent, or other (reward and eye positions) variables. Tuning similarity is computed as the correlation in tuning functions, then these are discretized by their tuning similarity (r 2 =[0-.25; 0.25-0.5; 0.5-0.75; 0.75-1]) and averaged within each category (e.g., sensorimotor or latent) and tuning similarity bin. C.P. is expressed as a ratio, normalized to the bin with lowest tuning similarity (leftmost), such that a C.P. ratio of ~3 (e.g., sensorimotor variables in dlPFC) indicates that coupling is three times more likely given high vs. low tuning similarity.</figDesc><graphic coords="13,39.50,46.35,532.73,477.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Radial bias (slope describing the relation between target position and response) and precision(R 2 of the regression between target position and response) during high (x-axis) and low (y-axis) optic flow density conditions. Monkeys are in different colors, transparent circles are individual sessions, and error bars are means and S.E.M of each monkey. Overall, monkeys undershoot more and becomes less precise with less sensory evidence. C. Gain modulation of tuning functions, for all task variables and the three brain areas; MSTd, area 7a, and dlPFC. Gain is the slope describing the tuning functions in low vs. high density. Error bars are bootstrapped 95% CI. D. Unitto-unit coupling strength for each brain region, and contrasting low (x-axis) and high (y-axis) optic flow density conditions. Coupling strength is quantified as the area under the curve of the coupling filters, and these are plotted on a log-scale for visibility. E. Cumulative density of the coupling filters correlation coefficient (r) between low-and high-density conditions, for all three brain regions. Chance and ceiling-levels were determined by permutation. F. Left: Correlation between the average coupling filter correlation within a given session (transparent circles), for each brain region, and the change in radial bias (high density -low density; positive values indicate more undershooting in the low-density condition). Larger, opaque circle is the average (y-axis = behavior; x-axis = coupling filter stability) across sessions. Only sessions with both density conditions and at least 5 coupled neurons were included.

The coupling filters are ordered from top to bottom, according to their maximal occurrence for any pair of emitter and receiver. The percentage within each box indicates what percent of coupling filters, the particular emitter-receiver pair, that were of the particular kind. Ten examples (if available) are plotted in semi-transparent and in the background, and the average across all coupling filters of the particular type are plotted in opaque and with a thicker line. Percentages refer to the percent of coupling filters between an emitter and a receiver that were clustered within the given category. X-axis is a z-score of firing rate (in Hz) and Y-axis is time in seconds (maximum = 600ms). Importantly, these coupling filters are not sinusoidal.</figDesc><graphic coords="36,118.50,56.70,374.70,621.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>

As described in the main text, overall neurons in 7a were more likely to spike in phase with its own LFP phases. Neurons who were tuned to the LFP in a different area (dark blue), were significantly more likely to be tuned to the LFP in their own area (left column) than neurons that were not tuned to the phase of LFP in another area (light blue). On the other hand, whether units were coupled or not with neurons in another area (uncoupled in light blue and coupled in dark blue) did not impact their likelihood of being tuned to the ongoing phase of LFPs in their own area (right column). MSTd is not depicted, as there was no phase locking of dlPFC neurons to the ongoing LFP phase in MSTd. This analysis is based on 5929 coupling pairs in area 7a (blue) and 4190 coupling pairs in dlPFC (red).</figDesc></figure>

Next, we attempted to recover these tuning functions, while including or excluding (i.e., zeroing) the tuning to radial distance to target. Across all simulation (n = 1344), the P-GAM never excluded distance to target from its selected model when this variable had not been zeroed (0.0% false negative), and only once failed to exclude this variable from its final selection when the variable had been zeroed (0.0007% false positive).
