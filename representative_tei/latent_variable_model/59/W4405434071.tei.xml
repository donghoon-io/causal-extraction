<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The use of graphical models to represent causal hypotheses has enabled revolutionary progress in the study of the foundations of quantum theory. Here we consider directed acyclic graphs each of which contains both nodes representing observed variables as well as nodes representing latent or hidden variables. When comparing distinct causal structure, a natural question to ask is if they can explain distinct sets of observable distributions or not. Statisticians have developed a great variety of tools for resolving such questions under the assumption that latent nodes be interpreted classically. Here we highlight how the change to a quantum interpretation of the latent nodes induces distinctions between causal scenarios that would be classically indistinguishable. We especially concentrate on quantum scenarios containing latent nodes with at least one latent parent, a.k.a. possessing intermediate latents. This initial survey demonstrates that many such quantum processes can be operationally distinguished by considerations related to monogamy of nonlocality, especially when computationally aided by a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations which we tailor for the study of such scenarios. We conclude by clarifying the challenges that prevent the generalization of this work, calling attention to open problems regarding observational (in)equivalence of quantum causal structures with intermediate latents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The field of causal inference examines the relationship between statistical correlations and causal connections among a set of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The causal structure is depicted using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can include both observed and latent (unobserved) nodes. Recently, the quantum information community has shown interest in this field, recognizing it as a highly precise framework for understanding and studying Bell nonlocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Physicists have innovated by allowing latent nodes to represent quantum systems. For example, the standard Bell scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is illustrated by the DAG in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where blue square nodes are observed nodes and the circular node represents a latent node, hence observing a probability distribution p(a,b|x,y).</p><p>Causal inference techniques were initially developed for causal structures with only classical latent nodes in the context of machine learning. Therefore, causal scenarios where some latent nodes have other latent nodes as parents are overlooked. This omission is due to the existence of an exogenization procedure, introduced by Evans <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, that relies on the ability to clone classical information, enabling the construction of a DAG that is observationally equivalent1 but includes only exogenous latent nodes (meaning no latent node has latent parents). However, this procedure fails when quantum resources are introduced, as quantum information cannot be cloned <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Furthermore, the procedure fails in any nonclassical theory as the no-broadcasting theorem is generalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Consequently, a large family of causal structures involving nonclassical latent nodes remains unexplored.</p><p>Althoughitis wellknown thatthe exogenization procedure does not apply when considering nonclassical theories, in the literature there is not much information regarding the differences between exogenous and non-exogenous versions of causal scenarios. The first concrete example pointing out this discrepancy was given in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 8</ref>] which contrasts two DAG varieties with seven observed nodes. Here, we show that even in scenarios with only four observed nodes we also encounter this distinction.</p><p>Here we partition quantum causal structures into sets such that all structures within a set map to the same structure under exogenization. In Sections III and IV we investigate the set of DAGs all of which are associated with an extended Bell scenario, ultimately proving that every DAG in this set can be distinguished from every other. Some of our proofs rely on a novel efficient adaptation of the Quantum Inflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> procedure for the study of DAGs with intermediate quantum latents. In Section V we explore DAGs whose exogenized template matches the quantum network with a tetrahedron-like facial structure. While we are capable of distinguishing many pairs of DAGs in that set, the (in)equivalence between some pairs of DAGs in that set remains unresolved. We conclude with a variety of tantalizing open questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. REVISITING EXOGENIZATION</head><p>Let us revisit the exogenization procedure with the goal of pinpointing why it is not valid for nonclassical theories. The exogenization procedure takes any nonexogenous causal scenario and returns an exogenous one which is observationally equivalent (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). It consists of two different steps: 1.</p><p>Add direct causal influences (arrows) from the parents of the intermediate latent node to the children of it (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Eliminate the causal connections from the parent nodes to the intermediate latent node (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). Assuming that the intermediate latent node is nonclassical, the first step is valid for all nonclassical theories. The reason is that the nonclassical subsystems going through the added arrows (i.e. directly from the parent of the intermediate node to the children of it) can also go through the nonclassical intermediate node in the scenario without the extra arrows. Therefore, both scenarios (before and after the first step) are observationally equivalent if the intermediate node is nonclassical. (We revisit the case of classical intermediate latent nodes in Appendix C). On the other hand, the second step is not valid for nonclassical theories per the No Broadcasting theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>That said, there are at least three special cases in which one can exogenize (even when considering nonclassical latent nodes) without changing the set of achievable probability distributions, i.e. the exogenized and non-exogenized cases are equivalent at the observational level. They are: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. OBSERVATIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXOGENIZED AND NON-EXOGENIZED SCENARIOS WITH NONCLASSICAL SOURCES</head><p>In this section, we show the observational difference that arises when one intermediate latent node is added to an extended Bell scenario. We start with this simpler scenario to build our intuition before going to the tetrahedron causal structure. The extended Bell scenario is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>. It is a tripartite Bell scenario that allows for signalling from the settings of the first two players (Alice and Bob) to the third one (Charlie) who does not perform its own setting. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>, we depict one possible 2-layer version of the DAG which introduces an intermediate latent between Bob and Charlie that receives the setting y to maintain the no-signaling constraints (d-separation relations) while avoiding being a trivial case where the exogenization is possible. We here consider that every observed variable is binary, i.e. a,b,c,x,y ∈ {0,1}. In order to make the observational difference explicit, we propose a protocol to achieve a probability distribution in the non-exogenous scenario and prove that it is not achievable in the exogenized scenario via an interrupted graph. This protocol can be easily adapted to compare the quantum set as well as the no-signaling set of probability distributions of both scenarios.</p><p>The protocol to define a probability distribution P (a,b,c,x,y) in the non-exogenous scenario is the following. Let the root latent node, λ ABC , share the resource needed to violate the classical bound of the CHSH inequality (note that any violation is enough), for example a 2-qubit maximally entangled state when discussing quantum theory. Then, the intermediate latent node, µ BC , and A perform the measurements needed to violate the CHSH inequality using X and Y (which are random bits) as the respective settings. Finally, the intermediate latent node, µ BC , sends the result of the measurement to both B and C who will output it while A outputs her result of the measurement. This leads us to obtain P 2-layer (a,b,c|x,y) = P CHSH&gt;2 (a,b|x,y)δ b=c , <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where P CHSH&gt;2 (a,b|x,y) is a certain probability that exceeds the classical bound of the CHSH inequality. For example, if we consider quantum latent nodes, it could be the probability distribution achieving the Tsirelson's bound or if we consider post-quantum latent nodes, it could be a PR-box distribution. Now, we shall show that the probability distribution P 2-layer (a,b,c|x,y) is not achievable in the exogenized scenario. In order to do this, we use the interrupted graph shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4</ref> where B and C receive possibly different values of Y .</p><p>The idea of using this interrupted graph is to check whether a probability distribution (P 2-layer (a,b,c|x,y) in our case) is feasible or not in the original scenario. This feasibility question is translated into the mathematical problem of finding a probability distribution on the interrupted scenario, Q(a,b,c|x,y,y ′ ), that satisfies all the no-signaling constraints coming from it while also meeting the compatibility constraints relative to the original scenario, namely, "optimization" problem of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is infeasible. Via Farkas' Lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> we obtain witnesses of the infeasibility of P 2-layer (a,b,c|x,y) in the exogenized scenario, and these witnesses can be regarded as monogamy relations. One such relation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">max Q(a,b,c|x,y,y ′ ) 1 (2) s.t. Q(b|x,y,y ′ ) = Q(b|y,y ′ ) Q(a,c|x,y,y ′ ) = Q(a,c|x,y ′ ) Q(a,b|x,y,y ′ ) = Q(a,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">CHSH (A,B|X,Y ) +2⟨B Y C XY ⟩ ≤ 4<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where CHSH (A,B|X,Y ) is the usual CHSH between A and B with X and Y as the settings and ⟨B Y C XY ⟩ is the correlator of B and C for each value of X and Y . This monogamy relation shows that having nonlocal correlations between A and B bounds the level of correlation we can have between B andC. This concept is not new, it was studied for many Bell scenarios in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, the novelty presented here is that even if the thirdplayerhas access to the settings ofthe otherplayers, he cannot be perfectly correlated with anyone if they are performing a nonlocal protocol. This addition remarks even more the monogamous nature of entanglement and its intrinsic randomness. Note that analogous monogamy relations can be obtained changing the correlator ⟨B Y C XY ⟩ to ⟨A X C XY ⟩ in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>). We can use similar techniques to develop novel entropic monogamy inequalities using the Braunstein-Caves inequalities, see Appendix E for details.</p><p>In short, we have shown that </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. VERSIONS OF THE 2-LAYER SCENARIOS</head><p>Once we have shed light on the observational difference between the 1-layer and 2-layer scenarios there is a natural follow up question. Is there an observational difference as well between different versions of 2-layer scenarios coming from a single 1-layer scenario? In this section we address this question by comparing all the possible 2-layer versions of the exogenized scenario. From now on, we focus on quantum latent nodes unless we specify it.</p><p>There are three possible 2-layer scenarios coming from the exogenous one. The one previously presented with the BC intermediate node, one in which the intermediate latent node is between A and C, Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> Proof. First we prove that the BC intermediate node scenario is not contained in the AC intermediate node scenario. The proof is computational, using the NPA hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for noncommutative polynomial optimization. We encode the presence of an AC intermediate latent as noncommutation relations between operators of Alice and Charlie when the setting they share in common -namely, X -takes different values. By contrast, in the exogenized case, operators associated with different parties always commute. In our Semidefinite Program for the AC intermediate node scenario we set the objective function to be maximized to be the left-hand side of Eq. (3), using (X,Y ) = (0,0) for the correlator of B and C. Our open-source implementation can be found online <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and is accomplished by manually adapting the current version of the Inflation package <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to capture the new commutation rules. We find that with an AC intermediate latent we have For completeness, we note that the bound in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is tight, as itcan be achievedby setting Charlie andAlice to always report the same value, namely that produced by the measurement at the intermediate latent position. This corresponds to maximizing a bipartite payoff function slightly different than CHSH, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">CHSH (A,B|X,Y ) +2⟨B 0 C 00 ⟩ ≤ 8/ √ 3 ≈</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">CHSH (A,B|X,Y ) +2⟨A 0 B 0 ⟩ ≤ 8/ √ 3 ≈ 4.6188.</formula><p>V. TETRAHEDRON</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Difference in the 4 party scenario</head><p>Let us now focus on the tetrahedron scenario (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), which is more complex although it has fewer observed nodes than the previous scenario. In order to show the observational difference between the 1-layer and 2-layer scenarios, we use the 2-layer version of the tetrahedron with the BC intermediate node (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Notice that Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> depicts only one possible 2-layer version of the tetrahedron: We could also add distinct and/or additional intermediate latent nodes, up to a maximum of six intermediate latent nodes.</p><p>We follow analogous steps in order to show the observational difference. First, we propose a protocol in order to achieve a certain distribution in the 2-layer scenario and then we prove that it is incompatible with the 1-layer scenario. FIG. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Tetrahedron scenario.</p><p>The protocol is based on the same idea of making the intermediate latent a player in the CHSH game who, afterwards, send the result to its observed children. Concretely, our protocol needs that the latent node ABC (we could follow an analogous protocol using BCD) is the bipartite resource necessary to violate the CHSH inequality and that the sources ACD and BCD are classically correlated mixed states, Let us now show that this probability distribution is not achievable in the 1-layer version of the tetrahedron scenario. In order to do so, we construct the inflated scenario of the 1-layer tetrahedron depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> and proceed with a proof by contradiction. We start by assuming that P 2LT is feasible in the 1-layer tetrahedron. Then, the goal is to find a probability distribution on the inflated scenario,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ACD = 1 2 (|000⟩⟨000|+|111⟩⟨111|), BCD = 1 2 (|00⟩⟨00|+|11⟩⟨11|),<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q(a x , a o , b y , b o , c x , c y , c o , d x , d y )</formula><p>, such that it satisfies all the constraints coming from the inflated causal structure as well as the compatibility constraints regarding the original scenario.</p><p>Note that, in the inflated DAG, there are several injectable sets, concretely, all the adjacent pairs of observed nodes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. Mathematically, this translates into the following compatibility constraints,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q(a x ,a o ,d x ) = P 2LT (a x ,a o ,d x ) Q(a x ,a o ,c x ,c y ,c o ) = P 2LT (a x ,a o ,c x ,c y ,c o ) Q(b y ,b o ,c x ,c y ,c o ) = P 2LT (b y ,b o ,c x ,c y ,c o ) Q(b y ,b o ,d y ) = P 2LT (b y ,b o ,d y ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Then, as in P 2LT we observe that a x = d x = c x , b y = c y = d y and b o = c o , we only need the marginal probability of {A o ,C x ,C y ,C o } to have all the required information to completely define the entire probability distribution over all the outputs. Therefore, as this marginal is injectable, imposing the compatibility constraints, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>), completely determines Q. In particular, Q = P 2LT . Now, we can simplify our inflation using causal inference rules (the two rules that we use were presented for classical latent nodes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> but are easily extendible to nonclassical latent nodes). The first one states that any latent node with only one child can be removed from the DAG without loss of generality, so that we can remove BCD 2 and ACD 2 . The second one says that if two nodes are sharing a bipartite common cause and a tripartite (shared with another node) common cause, the bipartite one can be removed without loss of generality, so that we can remove ABD Note that this simplified inflation is observationally equivalent to a 5-observed node scenario which is exactly the same as the extended Bell scenario where (D x ,D y ) play the role of (X,Y ). This equivalence was pointed out by Fritz in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> under the notion of correlation scenario. The concrete probability distribution on the simplified inflation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q(a o ,b o ,c o |d x ,d y ) = P CHSH&gt;2 (a o ,b o |d x ,d y )δ b o ,c o .</formula><p>Notice that this correlation is the same probability distribution as P 2-layer if we match (d x ,d y ) = (x,y). However, we already proved that this distribution is not achievable in Fig. <ref type="figure">3 a</ref>) on account of Eq. (3). Hence, we have reached a contradiction and, therefore, P 2LT is infeasible on the 1-layer tetrahedron.</p><p>In summary:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 3. The no intermediate node and BC intermediate node tetrahedron scenarios are observationally distinct, with the set of distributions explained by the former being strictly contained in the set of distributions explained by the latter.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Multiple intermediate nodes</head><p>The same question about observational differences among the different 2-layer versions arises when considering the tetrahedron. In contrast to the extended Bell scenario, the tetrahedron has six possible positions for intermediate latents, and hence there are 64 distinct variants of the tetrahedron we might consider, 63 of which are non-exogenous. Here, we do not answer whether all 64 variants are observationally different.</p><p>Rather, we delay the answer to that question to future work.2 Nevertheless, we distinguish between some variants of the tetrahedron scenario by extending the previous proof employed to differentiate the case of zero intermediate latents from the case of one intermediate latent (BC).</p><p>Note that the previous proof relies on the construction of the inflation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. Then, one can add as many intermediate nodes (different from BC) as one wants while being able to construct a non-fan out inflation with the same injectable sets. Particularly, the possible additions are BD, AD and AC. Hence, an analogous proof exists to differentiate any version with only a subset of {BD,AD,AC} from any other version that performs the BC intermediate node; see Appendix A for a detailed proof. Then, by relabeling the parties one can show observational differences between more 2-layer versions of the tetrahedron.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>We have shown that intermediate latents cannot be ignored when studying the observational consequences of quantum networks, as their presence or absence changes the set of observable statistics which can be explained. We have discussed how these operational implications can be traced back to the lack of a quantum analog of the classical exogenization procedure, due to No Broadcasting. We have not attempted to capture all the consequences of intermediate latents, but merely to show that for at least some correlations they make or break the existence of a quantum causal explanation. Our proofs have relied almost entirely on monogamy of nonlocality. That is, we demonstrate that a Bell inequality can be violated privately without involving an intermediate latent. However, the outcomes (for one party) of certain nonlocal correlations can only be replicated by an additional party if an intermediate latent is introduced in the appropriate location. A natural question for future research would be to understand if other qualitatively distinct differences between correlation sets -that is, beyond just monogamy of nonlocality -can also be attributed to the role of intermediate latents.</p><p>We have considered two elementary networks where intermediate latent could plausibly make a dif-ference -namely, the extended Bell scenario and the tetrahedron scenario -finding that they do make a difference in both of those networks. Further networks might be considered in future research. Regardless, any future research involving networks where at least two parties (outputs) are in the common causal future of at least least two root nodes (inputs or sources) one or more of which is nonclassical should include an accounting for intermediate latents (or their absence). Such scenarios arise, for instance, in the study of distributed computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. To some extent such considerations are also prevalent in the study of spacetime embeddings of causal processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, however spacetime embedding generally treats all inputs as implicitly allowing for a latent common cause. This allows for certain outputs to be independent of certain inputs, but does not express the notion of a complete common cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. As such, the directed acyclic graphs appearing in spacetime embedding literature have a distinct interpretation from those in this work.</p><p>All of the questions raised herein regarding the significance of intermediate latents in quantum networks can be revisited for non-quantum (but still nonclassical) physical theories, and for the framework of operational probabilistic theories in general. Some of our proofs here go apply to all physical theories with nonlocality, as such theories have inherent no-broadcasting restrictions. Props. 1 and 3 here are examples of such theory-agnostic proofs. Such proofs should be contrastedwiththose relying on semidefinite programming (such as of Prop. 2), which are specific to quantum theory. Some of the initial challenges impeding the generalization of our quantum-specific proofs to other physical theories are elucidated in Appendix B.</p><p>Let us also expose an irony pervasive in our proofs. We have claimed to be studying the significance of quantum intermediate latents, but all of our protocols for generating a correlation that cannot be explained This manuscript aims to inspire a broader research program, as it provides more questions than answers. We have found plenty of examples of pairs of graphically-distinct quantum-latent causal structures (one or both involving intermediate latents) which can be distinguished operationally despite their clas-sical counterparts being equivalent. These examples are meant to highlight the widespread failure of the classically-valid exogenization equivalence rule when applied to the quantum landscape. Despite these examples, however, we have also encountered pairs of DAGs, both involving intermediate latents, for which the question of their operational distinguishability remains open. An especially salient and challenging example of such a pair of scenarios can be found in Appendix D where we discuss why the open problem lead us to speculate about the need to develop a more nuanced generalization of Quantum Inflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>While the concrete open questions posed heretofore provide clear targets for future research, it is also worth stepping back to ask where this field of research is going. Here we have explored how one particular classical equivalence rule -namely, exogenization -fails to hold in the quantum paradigm. Which other classical equivalences rules fail under paradigm shift? What about classical inequivelence rules -could they fail as well? Does there exist a pair of causal scenarios which are operationally indistinguishable when allowing for quantum latents but where one explains strictly fewer correlations classically than the other? Additionally, given an exogenous latent template -i.e. an mDAG in the notation of Evans <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> -what are the different ways to de-exogenize it, in general? That is, how can we construct the set of all operationallydistinct quantum processes which map to a particular template under exogenization? The variants of causal structures considered here are such that whenever multiple intermediate latents are present, the intermediate latents are all relatively composed in parallel. What about sequential composition of intermediate latents? What is the "strongest" non-exogenous process that one can write down (in terms of greatest operational explanatory power), given an exogenous template? We endorse the conviction of Tein van der Lugt that lattice theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> has great potential to afford insights into these questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A: Proof of observational difference between different 2-layer versions of the tetrahedron</head><p>In this appendix, we show the explicit proof for the observational difference between different 2-layer versions of the tetrahedron. Concretely, we show that there is a difference between the version with only the BC intermediate node and the version with the AC, AD and BD, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref>. Note that by showing this difference we solve the question between all the versions that contain the BC intermediate and the versions that contain a subset of {AC,AD,BD}.</p><p>The proof is an extension of the proof for showing the observational difference between the 1-layer and 2-layer tetrahedron provided in the main text. We know that we can achieve the probability distribution P 2LT in the version with only the BC intermediate. Now, we can construct an analogous inflation to the one we used before but adding the 3 intermediate nodes {AC,AD,BD}, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">11</ref>. By this construction, we ensure that the adjacents pairs of parties are injectable. So, as in the main text, imposing the compatibility constraints, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>), completely determines the probability over the inflation to be Q = P 2LT .</p><p>Then, we can use causal inference rules plus the remarks we present in the main text about nonclassical exogenization to simplify the inflated scenario. First, we use the first two remarks about nonclassical exogenization to absorb BCD  <ref type="formula">4</ref>). Therefore, P 2LT (with maximal quantum violation of CHSH) is not achievable in the 2-layer version of the tetrahedron with {AD,BD,AC} intermediates. Notice that the proof of infeasibility is not a usual proof by inflation. It is not coming directly through the PSD completion problem proposed by the inflation but rather the relation of the inflation with the extended Bell scenario with the AC intermediate so that we can directly use our knowledge about it. Also note that if one does not include the AC intermediate node, there would be no necessity to piggyback on the extended Bell scenario with AC but rather on the exogenous extended Bell scenario.</p><p>Finally, it is natural to go further and ask why are The answer is that when one adds the AB or CD intermediates, the inflation necessarily becomes a fanout inflation (if one wants to preserve the injectability of the adjacent parties, which is key in our proof). This impedes directly piggybacking on our existing results. However, the study of causal models wherein one treats latent nodes as quantum systems does admit analysis in terms of fanout inflation graphs via the semidefinite programming hierarchy of Quantum Inflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C: Classical vs quantum intermediate latent nodes</head><p>In this section we discuss the relevance of the intermediate latent's nature (classical or quantum) at the observational level, i.e. which probability distributions are achievable within the causal scenario. In particular, we present a simple example to show that the first step of the exogenization procedure (i.e. add direct causal influences (arrows) from the parents of the intermediate latent node to the children of it) is not valid when considering classical intermediate latent nodes.</p><p>Consider a DAG in which the intermediate latent has 2 children with independent parents (or settings), see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14a</ref>. There, it is clear that the classicality of the intermediate node avoids the possibility of observing a Bell inequality violation on the marginal distribution of (AB|XY ). However, when we add the direct arrows from the nonclassical sources to the children of the intermediate node, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14b</ref>, one can share entanglement between A and B and therefore violate a Bell inequality. Hence, the scenarios before and after the first step of the exogenization procedure are not observationally inequivalent making this step invalid for DAGs which perform classical intermediate nodes with nonclassical parents. From the example above it is easy to see that the first step of exogenization is not valid in general when the intermediate is classical.</p><p>On the other hand, there are many scenarios where it is far from clear if the physical nature of the intermediate node leads to an operational difference or not. In particular, consider a scenario in which the first step of the exogenization procedure has already been performed. That is, lets consider a scenario where where A X and B Y are the observed variables given a certain value of their settings. Now, we shall use them to obtain explicit entropic monogamy relations which exploit monogamy of entanglement. Let us come back to the simple example of the extended Bell scenario but now we allow for any number of outputs in every player while keeping binary settings. We depict the interrupted scenario where C receives different values of X and Y in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">17</ref>.</p><p>We then apply the properties of Shannon entropy, monotonicity, strong subadditivity and the chain rule to the variables of the different coexisting sets. Notice that the 2-layer versions of the extended Bell scenario can clearly violate these monogamy inequalities (respectively). Although, the Braunstein-Caves inequality is not violated by the Tsirelson box, it can be violated by a quantum protocol that leads to a mixture of the Tsirelson box and a local distribution. Then, as the 2-layer versions can perform this quantum protocol measuring in the intermediate node and forwarding the outcome to C as well as to A (B), we find that C can be perfectly correlated with A (B) and still have BC AB &lt; 0.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.

Finally, we project onto the space of coexisting sets in the original scenario by eliminating terms which involve entropies of sets in which X ≠ X ′ or Y ≠ Y ′ using Fourier-Motzkin elimination. Concretely, we sum the four inequalities coming from the positivity of conditional entropy and conditional mutual informationH(A 0 |B 0 C 00 )+I(B 0 ,C 00 |A 0 ) ≥ 0, H(A 0 |B 1 C 00 )+I(B 1 ,C 00 |A 0 ) ≥ 0, H(B 0 |A 1 C 00 )+I(A 1 ,C 00 |B 0 ) ≥ 0, H(C 00 |B 1 A 1 )+I(A 1 ,B 1 |C 00 ) ≥ 0 (E2)to obtain the entropic inequalityH(A 0 B 0 )+H(A 0 B 1 )+H(A 1 B 0 ) -H(A 1 B 1 )-H(A 0 )-H(B 0 ) +2H(A 0 C 00 )-H(A 0 )-H(C 00 ) ≥ 0 (E3)which can be read asBC AB +H(A 0 |C 00 )+H(C 00 |A 0 ) ≥ 0 (E4)where BC AB is all the terms of the Braunstein-Caves inequality (E1) for the parties A and B. This entropic inequality (E4) is a monogamy relation because it reflects the trade-off between the violation of the entropic Bell inequality (E1) and the degree of correlation between two parties, with only one of them involved in the prior Bell inequality. Note that whenever A 0 and C 00 are perfectly correlated we have H(A 0 |C 00 ) + H(C 00 |A 0 ) = 0, and hence that BC AB ≥ 0. That is, no violation of the Braunstein-Caves inequality is possible while having A perfectly correlated with C for setting X = 0. On the other hand, a violation of BC AB , i.e. BC AB &lt; -ϵ, correspondingly imposes thatH(A 0 |C 00 )+H(C 00 |A 0 ) &gt; ϵ. Thus, any violation of the Braunstein-Cave inequality implies that A and C cannot be perfectly correlated.We can readily derive related entropic inequalities by merely considering different values of the settings, BC AB +H(A X |C XY )+H(C XY |A X ) ≥ 0 for X,Y ∈ {0,1}, or by invoking the underlying symmetry A ↔ B to obtain BC AB +H(B Y |C XY )+H(C XY |B Y ) ≥ 0.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Generalization to Operational Probabilistic Theories</head><p>We shall consider the same questions we have answered for quantum theory under the perspective of OperationalProbabilisticTheories (OPTs). Concretely, we will use the term OPT to refer to the most general OperationalProbabilisticTheorythatsatisfies causality (i.e. no-signaling constraints andsource independence) and device-replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>As stated in the main text, the proof to show the observational difference between the exogenized scenario and the BC intermediate node scenario is valid as well when considering the set of OPT correlations. So, the 3 While Quantum Inflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was introduced as a numerical tool, it turns out that the underlying PSD-completion problem can be tackled entirely analytically in the special case a set of not-all-commuting measurements can be arranged in a sequence such that adjacent measurement pairs in the sequence not only commute but also are give rise to perfectly correlated operational statistics. significance of having multiple layers of nonclassical latent nodes extends to post-quantum theories.</p><p>On the other hand, the question of whether the different 2-layer versions (BC intermediate node scenario, AC intermediate node scenario and both intermediate nodes scenario) coming from the extended Bell scenario lead to different sets of correlations remains opened when considering OPT correlations. The explanation of why the proof of observational difference that we derived for quantum theory does not follow for OPTs is the following. In order to show the difference for quantum theory we use the asymmetric task of C copying B while A and B violate CHSH. As we have seen, within quantum theory, it is possible to succeed in the task only if the BC intermediate node is present. However, when one considers OPT correlations, it happens that one can achieved the task with the unique presence of the AC intermediate node. The reason is that the extremal point of the OPT set of correlations (for (AB|XY )) is the PR box probability distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> which allows one to compute the output of Bob (Alice) with certainty if one has access to both settings and the output of Alice (Bob). Hence, by using the AC intermediate node to perform the measurement, C knows the value of both settings and Alice's output and therefore he can copy Bob's output while A an B maximally violate the CHSH inequality.</p><p>Regarding the tetrahderon scenario, the observational difference between the exogenous and nonexogenous versions is still valid as well for OPT correlations as we derived it using only non-fan out inflation and the previous results on the extended Bell scenario (that are valid for OPTs). Then, for the question of whether the different 2-layer versions of the tetrahderon are observationally equivalent or not, the results that hold for OPT correlations are only those which piggyback on the knowledge about the extended Bell scenario (because as we just stated, the proofs for differentiating the Bell scenarios with only one intermediate node are not OPT valid). Concretely, regarding OPTs, the versions of the 2-layer tetrahedron that present the BC intermediate are observationally different from the versions that contain a subset of {AD,BD}. (Then, by relabelling the parties, one can do analogous proofs to show observational difference between other versions). The purpose of this appendix is to throw down the gauntlet for future research by calling attention to an especially tantalizing open question. The two causal structures in Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref> both involve intermediate latents. One using a trio of three intermediate latents in parallel, each having two children. The other utilizes a single intermediate latent with three observable children. The question is simply: Are these two DAGs observationally equivalent or not?</p><p>Following the previous proofs leveraging monogamy of nonlocality, we conjecture that these two variant causal structure might be distinguished by considering the probability distribution P (a,b,c,d|x,y) = P CHSH&gt;2 (a,b|x,y)δ b=c=d . (D1) On the one hand, the correlation of Eq. (D1) is readily realizable in the single-tripartite intermediate scenario by a protocol analogous to the one proposed in Sec. III. Namely, let the measurement that Bob would perform to violate the CHSH inequality actually be performed in the intermediate latent node. The resulting classical value is then forwarded to all of its children, namely (B,C,D).</p><p>On the other hand, we cannot conceive of any protocol following the process of the three-bipartite intermediates scenario which would lead to the correlation of Eq. (D1). While the absence of a construction could be an artifact of our limited imagination, our intuition is that it should be possible to certify causal incompatibility here using some generalization of Quantum Inflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> a la Sec. IV. However, if one limits their considerations to moment matrices generated by sequences of individually injectable operators -as we did in Sec. IV here -one finds that the two scenarios in Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref> would admit the same (non)commutation relations. Consequently, we conclude that such (naturally) restricted SDPs are incapable of distinguishing those two scenarios. We speculate this to be a bug, not a feature. That is, we take this open problem as indicating the need to develop a more nuanced generalization of Quantum Inflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Speculation aside, both possible answers to the open problem are presently plausible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix E: Entropic monogamy relations</head><p>Notice that the monogamy relations presented in the main text are of the same flavour as the monogamy relations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In this appendix we present monogamy relations in terms of entropic quantities, as per those in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The idea behind the Fritz's type monogamy relations is the causal dependency, i.e. the level of correlations between a subset of parties that share a common causal past limits the amount of correlation they can have with other nodes that do not share the same causal past. On the other hand, the idea behind the type of monogamy relations presented here is monogamy of entanglement, i.e. the amount of nonlocality observed by a subset of the children of a multipartite source bounds the level of correlations they share with the rest of the children.</p><p>Although the monogamy relations which exploit monogamy of entanglement have been well investigated, they have not been explored using entropic relations whereas the Fritz's type were introduced directly from that perspective. Here, we present the first entropic monogamy relations that rely on monogamy of entanglement. This allows us to obtain some monogamy relations regardless of the number of outputs of each player.</p><p>In order to find the entropic monogamy relations of this kind we must use entropic Bell inequalities. The conceptofentropic Bellinequalities was firstdeveloped by Braunstein and Caves <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> who introduced the entropic inequality equivalent to the CHSH inequality. (See Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for an excellent review.) There are four Braunstein-Caves inequalities, one for each relabelling of the settings. One of them is</p></div>			</div>
