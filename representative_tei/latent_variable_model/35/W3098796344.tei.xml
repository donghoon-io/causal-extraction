<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are nonsurgical procedures to open blocked blood vessels to the heart, frequently using a catheter to place a stent. The catheter can be inserted into the blood vessels using an artery in the groin or an artery in the wrist. Because clinical trials have indicated that access via the wrist may result in fewer post procedure complications, shortening the length of stay, and ultimately cost less than groin access, adoption of access via the wrist has been encouraged. However, patients treated in usual care are likely to differ from those participating in clinical trials, and there is reason to believe that the effectiveness of wrist access may differ between males and females. Moreover, the choice of artery access strategy is likely to be influenced by patient or physician unmeasured factors. To study the effectiveness of the two artery access site strategies on hospitalization charges, we use data from a state-mandated clinical registry including 7,963 patients undergoing PCI. A hierarchical Bayesian likelihood-based instrumental variable analysis under a latent index modeling framework is introduced to jointly model outcomes and treatment status. Our approach accounts for unobserved heterogeneity via a latent factor structure, and permits nonparametric error distributions with Dirichlet process mixture models. Our results demonstrate that artery access in the wrist reduces hospitalization charges compared to access in the groin, with a higher mean reduction for male patients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">WHICH ARTERY ACCESS SITE TO USE?</head><p>A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a nonsurgical procedure that uses a catheter (thin flexible tube) to place a small structure, usually a stent, in the blocked blood vessels that have been narrowed by plaque buildup. The catheter could be inserted into the blood vessels either via an artery in the groin (a femoral artery), or via an artery in the wrist (a radial artery). There are over one million PCIs performed each year in the United States, predominantly using femoral arterial access <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feldman et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Bader et al., 2017)</ref>. Early complications after a PCI include bleeding from the arterial access site as well as vascular complications such as blood transfusions, hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebrovascular accidents.</p><p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indicated that these complications occur less frequently after radial arterial access compared to femoral arterial access PCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ferrante et al., 2016)</ref>, and these fewer complications may likely lead to lower hospitalization charges <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Safley et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Amin et al., 2013)</ref>. However, such differences in hospitalization charges and in complications between the arterial access sites have not been well-studied in an observational setting where patients and physicians are likely to differ from those in RCTs.</p><p>There are many methodological challenges when comparing the effectiveness of radial and femoral arterial access strategies in observational data. First, healthier patients are often selected to undergo radial arterial access PCI, thus introducing selection bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rao et al., 2008)</ref>. It is, however, almost impossible to have complete measurements for all the health indicators that could have contributed to a physician's decision to perform a radial rather than a femoral arterial access PCI. Second, RCTs that have studied the effectiveness of the two access strategies also reported evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity <ref type="bibr">(Rao et al.,</ref> Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association 1 WHICH ARTERY ACCESS SITE TO USE? 2008). For instance, female patients tend to have fewer bleeding and vascular complications with radial arterial access versus femoral arterial access, compared to male patients. With the recent push to encourage adoption of radial arterial access PCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feldman et al., 2013)</ref>, it is important to understand the comparative effectiveness of the two arterial access site strategies in observational settings. To do so, we make use of a state-mandated clinical registry coordinated by the Massachusetts Data Analysis Center (Mass-DAC) for 7,963 adults undergoing PCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mauri et al., 2008a)</ref>. Our goal is to estimate heterogeneous access site effects based on sex of patients in observational data where there is also selection bias.</p><p>To compare the effectiveness of radial and femoral arterial access strategies in observational data, we investigate likelihood-based estimators for instrumental variable analysis using a latent index model framework <ref type="bibr">(Heckman and</ref><ref type="bibr">Vytlacil, 1999, Vytlacil, 2002)</ref>. Under this framework, model assumptions are jointly specified on treatment and potential outcomes. Necessary assumptions along with sensitivity analysis for the assumptions to make a valid causal inference based on such estimators are assessed. Our focus is on a Bayesian latent factor approach, which is a nonparametric extension of the approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heckman et al. (2014)</ref>, to make posterior inference on the estimates of causal effects, with particular emphasis in settings where there is treatment effect heterogeneity. Our approach has several practical advantages over earlier approaches. It provides a framework to model complex latent structures and account for non homogeneous correlation structures that standard parametric approaches do not. We do not rely on parametric distribution of errors.</p><p>Further, Bayesian methodology is used to estimate and make posterior inference on causal parameters for which analytical estimates can be intractable. Simulations are developed to Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association characterize operating characteristics of various estimators. Finally, we implement our approach to study heterogeneous treatment effects of radial arterial access compared to femoral arterial access PCI on hospitalization charges based on sex of the patients.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. We introduce the data and provide background literature for latent index models in Section 2. We then introduce our proposed approach using a nonparametric Bayesian model in the context of latent index modeling with latent factors, along with parameter estimation and derivation of treatment effects in Section 3. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach via simulation studies in Section 4 and illustrate our strategy using the PCI data in Section 5. We end with discussion in Section 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data and Outcomes</head><p>The state-mandated clinical registry coordinated by the Mass-DAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mauri et al., 2008a)</ref> includes all PCIs performed in all nonfederal acute care Massachusetts hospitals for patients at least 18 years of age, regardless of health insurance status. The registry data are populated by trained data managers at each hospital. Baseline covariates include demographic information, such as age, sex, race, types of health insurance; comorbidities and family history of cardiac problems; cardiac presentation prior to the PCI, such as ejection fraction, cardiac shock, acute coronary syndrome status; procedure-specific information, such as number of treated vessels, degree of blockage, artery access strategy, type of stent inserted; in-hospital complications; discharge medications; and survival status. The registry data are linked to the Massachusetts Acute Hospital Case-Mix billing data maintained by the Massachusetts Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association Center for Health Information and Analysis to obtain additional post-discharge hospitalization information, such as subsequent admissions for PCI, bypass surgery, heart attack, etc.</p><p>Information is linked using criteria based on combinations of treatment hospital, medical record number, admission or discharge date, and date of birth. Vital status is determined using the Massachusetts Registry of Vital Statistics as well as the National Death Index.</p><p>We focus on 7,963 adults ≥ 18 years old undergoing PCI in 2011. Patients who resided outside Massachusetts (to ensure completeness of 30-day follow-up) and those who were deemed to be of exceptional risk, defined as patients having high-risk features not captured by any variable in the data or cases where PCI offered the best or only option for improving the chance of survival, are excluded. Because patients can undergo more than one PCI during a hospitalization, the first or index PCI during the hospitalization is analyzed (see Supplemental Material for a complete list of covariates).</p><p>The main endpoint of interest is the health care (procedure-related) charges at hospital discharge. This is defined as the sum of full, undiscounted charges for patient care summarized by prescribed revenue codes for special care, routine accommodation, and ancillary services. Total charges do not include charges for telephone service, television, or private duty nurses. As expected, the distributions of total charges at discharge for patients with radial and femoral arterial access PCIs are skewed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Additional outcomes, including 30-day and 1-year hospitalizations for major bleeding and in-hospital vascular complications, and a falsification outcome, target vessel revascularization (TVR), are also considered. TVR is defined as PCI performed in a vessel treated during the index procedure or any coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed within Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association  1-year of undergoing the index PCI. TVR is a falsification outcome because no change in TVR is expected as a consequence of different arterial access <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mauri et al., 2008b)</ref>. in detail in Section 5. An instrument for the analysis can be defined based on contextual knowledge. Validity of the instrument is assessed with sensitivity analysis using the outcomes and baseline covariates described in this section, before proceeding to estimate treatment effects.</p></div>

Thus, the latent index model in Equation 1 also assumes that the variance-covariance matrix is homogeneous for everyone in the sample. This assumption of homogeneous variance can be unrealistic when the underlying treatment selection might vary by different patient subgroups, such as patients treated in different locations and hospitals. Additionally, if the parameter of interest is an average treatment effect, the covariance parameter between the potential outcomes, ρ 10 , is usually assumed to be zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chib and Hamilton, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, O'Malley et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Choi and O'Malley, 2017)</ref>. However, for estimating effects that are dependent on estimating distribution of Y i (1) -Y i (0), or some functionals of it, such as identifying fractions of a population that benefit from a given treatment, these approaches are inadequate. The correlation between Y (1) and Y (0) needs to be accounted for <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Heckman et al., 2014)</ref>, but because Y i (1) and Y i (0) are not observed for the same patient i, additional assumptions are necessary to identify ρ 10 . A latent factor structure is utilized in Section 3 to address these shortcomings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Model Estimation and Results</head><p>The DPM LIV model from Equations 2 and 3 is fitted on the observed data to compare the effectiveness of radial arterial access compared to femoral arterial access PCI in reducing hospitalization charges at discharge. Relatively noninformative prior of Normal(0, 100) is used on the coefficients in outcome and treatment models. The latent factor Θ is assumed to have Normal(0, 1) prior distribution for identification and the hyperpriors on Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association the stick breaking formulation of the DPM priors are specified as c ∼ Gamma(a, b) and τ ∼ InverseWishart(ν, Ψ). We conducted sensitivity analysis using both informative and noninformative prior specifications on c and τ . The results from the sensitivity analysis are reported in the Supplemental Material. The estimated posterior median of each treatment effect with different prior specifications are within $100 of each other, with very small difference on the posterior 95% credible intervals. The sensitivity analysis suggests that our findings are robust to the hyper-parameter specifications on the DPM priors.</p><p>To illustrate our findings, we continue with the assumption that a = 1, b = 10, ν = 2 and ψ -1 = 50. Ten thousand MCMC samples were drawn, and after 2,000 burn in and 10 thinning we retain an effective sample size of 800. Convergence of the chains was confirmed by assessing trace plots and ensuring that the Gelman-Rubin statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gelman et al., 2014)</ref> were below 1.1. The estimated posterior median along with 95% credible interval around the median of the treatment effects are reported in Radial arterial access PCI reduces the overall hospitalization charges compared to femoral arterial access PCI with a mean reduction of around $3,850. Furthermore, the reduction is about $1,500 more in male patients compared to the charges for female patients. Estimated ATE between radial and femoral arterial access PCI is -$2,815 in female patients compared to -$4,321 in male patients. The estimated ATT for radial arterial access PCI is similar to the estimated ATE. The posterior 95% credible interval for the ATT is wider and overlaps with that of the overall ATE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper, we studied heterogeneous treatment effects of different arterial access site strategies for PCI in reducing procedure related hospitalization charges at discharge, and proposed a novel Bayesian method to extend existing methodology for estimating treatment effects, when there is selection bias. Our new method relaxes assumptions of Normal errors in outcome models and homogeneous selection in treatment models that are often made in latent index variable models. Simulations established that our method performs better than existing methods and has reasonable frequentist properties.</p><p>Our overall finding is that radial arterial access PCI reduces hospitalization charges compared to femoral arterial access PCI. This finding is to some extent consistent with that of RCTs conducted previously, which have found that radial arterial access PCI is better than femoral arterial access PCI in reducing major bleeding and in-hospital complications.</p><p>However, our additional finding about the heterogeneous effects in male patients and female patients for hospitalization charges at discharge after PCI is novel. We found a reduction in charges after radial arterial access compared to femoral arterial access PCI to be higher for male patients than for female patients. This finding of differences in charges based on sex and different arterial access PCIs is in some way contrary to the findings in RCTs, which have shown that the radial arterial access PCI is more effective in female patients compared to male patients. We have an interesting result which certainly requires further investigation from practitioners and cardiac health researchers.</p><p>Methodologically, there are many directions to expand on the proposed work. While the main focus of this paper is on continuous outcomes, our work can be extended to other types of outcomes using generalized linear models. Our results assume linear relationship between the outcome and the covariates. There are many situations when this assumption of linearity might not hold. It will be important to explore methods that extend such restriction in the latent index modeling framework. We have also largely ignored the hierarchical structure of the data where the procedures are nested within hospitals. It is essential to expand our Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association work to account for such hierarchical structures. Further, we rely on many assumptions to make causal inference. Some of these assumptions are either testable or can be verified by sensitivity analysis as shown in this paper. However, there are assumptions that cannot be empirically tested or verified. It will be important to expand this work to include sensitivity analysis for such assumptions.

Approximately 30% of the patients are treated in the simulation setting to reflect the proportion undergoing radial artery access in our PCI cohort. The distribution of the errors in potential outcomes, 0 and 1 , is varied to quantify the effect of different error models on the estimates of the ATE and CATE.
