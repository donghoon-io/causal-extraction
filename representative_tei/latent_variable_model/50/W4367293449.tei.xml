<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a methodology classically used to relate continuous (observed) indicators to latent variables through a measurement model. Estimation approaches have been proposed to deal with situations in which the indicators do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, particularly when they are asymmetric, ordinal or binary. Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis (BCFA), which includes prior distributions for model parameters, has been used for such setups. Literature about CFA and BCFA for binary indicators is still scarce even though several applications in Epidemiology and Public Health could benefit from its use.</p><p>Objective: To systematize and discuss the main characteristics and computational implementation of the CFA and BCFA with binary indicators in R and Mplus software for the measurement of antenatal care quality in Primary Health Care (PHC) in Brazil.</p><p>Methods: Data from the external evaluation of the Brazilian National Program for the Improvement of Access to and Quality of Primary Health Care (PMAQ-AB) were used to assess the quality of antenatal care (construct).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) depicts the degree to which the specified indicators represent the theorized constructs. Even though CFA has been well-known for decades, the literature usually focuses on the description and implementation of traditional approaches for the analysis of multivariate normal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Its use, however, has grown in applications that include categorical variables, whether polytomous or ordinal <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. To deal with this type of data, different estimation methods were proposed, sometimes requiring adaptation in the interpretation of the results of these analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In cases where all indicators are binary, the relationships between the observed variables and their underlying latent variables (factors) are nonlinear. Thus, the factor loading for each item represents the probit or logit slope coefficient of regressing the item on its underlying factor. Therefore, the interpretation of the estimates differs from those obtained by the standard CFA, which assumes multivariate normality. For instance, the WLSMV (Weighted Least Squares Means and Variance Adjusted) estimator with probit link function has been widely recommended for analysing categorical indicators. In this context, each indicator is associated to a standard normal random variable. Moreover, the explained variability R 2 for the latent continuous response is equal to the squared standardized factor loading, and indicates the proportion of the variance of the indicator that is explained by the factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, Bayesian estimation in the context of latent variable modeling has been more accessible for a broad audience over the last decade, being particularly helpful in situations of greater complexity of the models, in which it is not possible to find a solution for the maximization of the objective function using the frequentist approach which considers, for instance, the Maximum Likelihood (ML) or (Weighted) Least Squares (WLS) estimation procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The Bayesian approach is based on distributions that express the uncertainty of the parameters before data are collected. Posterior distribution for the parameters is then often obtained through the likelihood of the data estimated via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which might be a computationally intensive procedure. After achieving convergence, the parameters are estimated from the posterior distribution and the point estimates summarize these distributions, using, for example, their mean, median or mode. The performance of the Bayesian approach does not require the data to be normally distributed and is independent of the assumption of asymptotic normality. Compared to the frequentist techniques, the Bayesian approach can provide more reliable results for small samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Nevertheless, a challenge for using the latter approach might be the need for specifying prior distributions for all parameters in the model: usually Normal distribution for factor loadings, inverse gamma distribution for error variances, and inverse Wishart distribution for the variance-covariance matrix of the factors. There is some debate in the literature about how default prior distributions offered by software programs are not always suitable, especially when samples are small <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, binary item CFA is implemented in major software programs, such as STATA, R and Mplus. CFA with binary indicators was recently discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al. (2021)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, most applications still assume that all items are continuous or at least ordinal <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Even less literature provides explicit guidance for substantive researchers who are interested in using Bayesian estimation for measurement models with binary indicators. In this tutorial, we provide a nontechnical discussion of the main aspects of the implementation of measurement models (i.e., CFA) with binary indicators, both using frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. We compared the implementation using R and Mplus software, highlighting their strenghts and limitations, as well as discussing guidelines on how to properly evaluate the model goodness-of-fit and how to speficy prior distributions when using Bayesian CFA (BCFA). To illustrate the concepts that are most relevant when using binary CFA, we define a construct related to antenatal care quality in Primary Health Care (PHC) in Brazil. We hope that this tutorial helps to spread awareness of the importance of properly specifying the nature of the data, choosing suitable methods (including priors when BCFA is used), applying diagnostic tools and correctly interpreting the results, particularly when CFA is based on binary indicators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Measurement Model for Binary Indicators Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is defined as the measurement model for Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and has as many parameters as the sum of the number of factor loadings and measurement errors. Factor loadings capture the strength of the relationships between observed (also known as indicators or manifest variables) and latent variables (also known as constructs or factors) and are extremely important for interpretation of the constructs, particularly when standardized to indicate the relative importance of the indicators. The CFA representation of the binary indicator setting is presented as follows.</p><p>Let y * be normally distributed, continuous latent random variables, underlying observed binary categorical variables y (called indicators herein), so that y = 0 if y * &lt; τ and y = 1 otherwise, with τ being the threshold. Therefore,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (y = 1|ζ) = P (y * &gt; τ |ζ) = Φ(Λ y ξ)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y * = Λ y ξ + δ<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ξ denotes the latent variables/factors and δ the measurement errors, such that E(δ) = 0 and all errors are uncorrelated with ξ. Considering the presence of Q indicators y q , q = 1, 2, ..., Q, the covariance matrix of the observed variables can be decomposed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Σ(θ) = Λ y φ ξ Λ ′ (y) + Θ δ<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Λ y , φ ξ and Θ δ represent, respectively, the factor loading matrix, the variancecovariance matrix of ξ and the variance-covariance matrix of δ <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>The proportion of the variability in the indicator variable that is explained by the factor is obtained by the square of the standardized factor loadings. In classical CFA (i.e, with continuous indicators), the usual cut-off point for indicating a relevant contribution of the indicator is 0.5 (using the standardized scale) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Moreover, the measurement of each construct can be evaluated for its reliability, which is the degree of internal consistency displayed when a measurement is repeated under identical conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Such measures can be calculated as function of factor loadings and measurement errors. A Cronbach's Alpha coefficient (Cronbach, 1951) of 0.70 has often been considered as an acceptable threshold for reliability, and captures the degree to which the set of scale items jointly vary in relation to the overall score <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. On the other hand, the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) measures how much variance is captured by a given construct in relation to the amount of variance attributable to a measurement error, i.e, the average amount of variance in the indicators that a construct can explain. AVE values greater than 0.5 may reflect acceptable levels of convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>CFA estimation is traditionally done using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, assuming that data follows a multivariate normal distribution, which is problematic when binary and/or categorical indicators are used. If ML is used in such cases, the model estimates are attenuated. To deal with violations for the normality assumption and the use of categorical indicators, several estimation methods have been proposed in the literature and are available in statistical software, such as, for instance, R and MPlus. Among these methods, stand out Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (DWLS), Mean-adjusted Weighted Least Squares (WLSM) or variance-adjusted Weighted Least Squares (WLSMV), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Unweighted Least Squares (ULS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. WLSMV is commonly identified as the "gold standard" method and it is the default estimator in R and Mplus software for the analysis of categorical indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>To evaluate CFA goodness-of-fit, several measures are available, including the CFI (Comparative Fit Index) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. The RMSEA aims to specify how well a model fits a population and not just the sample used for the estimation. Lower values of RMSEA indicate a better fit, specifically values below 0.06 indicate that the model is acceptable. The CFI is specified in such a way that its values vary between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a better fit. Generally, values below 0.95 are associated with models that do not fit the data well. The TLI is conceptually similar to the CFI, with values approaching 1 indicating appropriate fit. However, their values can be below 0 or above 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Commonly, the TLI and CFI provide very similar values <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It is noteworthy that these cut-off points raise several questions among researchers, especially in cases where the application of these adjustment indices is used to analyze categorical variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>Bayesian SEMs have been increasingly used, especially in cases where convergence is not achieved via the frequentist approach. One of its main advantages is the flexibility to deal with extremely complex models, in addition to providing more reliable results, especially for small samples due to its freedom from the asymptotic theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Despite this, a challenge for novice users of Bayesian methods is the need to specify prior distributions for all parameters of the model, which helps in making inference, providing more accurate results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Popular software programs for analyzing Bayesian SEMs offer standard noninformative priors with very wide distributions, which can put too much weight on unreasonable values, especially for small sample sizes. In cases where users do not specify their prior distributions, the choice of statistical software can influence results due to the fact that they use different standard priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>The Bayesian approach commonly estimates the model parameters via MCMC, an iterative and computationally intensive process that, based on the specified prior distributions, estimates a posteriori values for the parameters, which, in turn, are used to define the posterior distributions. The smaller the Potential Scale Reduction (PSR) value, the greater the indication of convergence of the estimation process. Point estimates provided by most software are defined by the median of the posterior distributions. Credibility intervals are then obtained from the percentiles of the posterior distributions to assess the degree of uncertainty around the estimated parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. The posterior standard deviation (SD) and 95% credible (or highest posterior density -HPD) interval can be inspected to assess whether the estimates are unusually certain or uncertain. Uncertainty is demonstrated by a large posterior SD and a wide 95% HPD.</p><p>For diagnostics in the Bayesian framework, several plots are used to visualize the prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions for model parameters. A trace plot verifying multiple chains can also indicate a misbehaving prior, which can result in plots that exhibit spikes or when the chains do not overlap, indicating that they are sampling from different parts of the posterior distribution and are not converging towards the same location. When at least one of the trace plots, prior-likelihoodposterior distribution plots, posterior SDs or 95% HPDs show signs of a misbehaving prior, results should not be trusted, and researchers should proceed with caution, especially when sample size is small. There is also Bayesian versions for CFA goodness-of-fit measures, such as the Bayesian Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (BRMSEA), the Bayesian Normed Fit Index (BNFI), the Bayesian Tucker-Lewis index (BTLI) and Bayesian Comparative Fit Index (BCFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>To make Bayesian SEM accessible for a broader audience, popular software programs, such as Mplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and R <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, through the blavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, offer default prior distributions. However, those default prior distributions are not always suitable. The Mplus default prior for factor loadings is the Normal distribution with a mean hyperparameter of zero and a variance of 10 10 [46, 49]. The variance hyperparameter corresponds to a standard deviation of 100.000, such that a wide range of parameter values can be sampled from the posterior distribution during the Bayesian analysis. The standard prior distribution in the R software is the Normal distribution with zero mean hyperparameter and variance equal to 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>In the next subsection we present details about the data on which these methodologies are applied. After that, a step-by-step tutorial for the computational implementation of CFA and BCFA with binary indicators is provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application: Antenatal Care Quality in Primary Health Care</head><p>The literature widely acknowledges the significance of antenatal care in relation to maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In order to ensure that such care is provided with the appropriate quality -in terms of the availability of resources and the development of specific activities in alignment with technical-scientific standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, these services need to be regularly monitored and evaluated. This will allow to identify shortcomings, and guide quality improvement efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. We describe the quality of antenatal care considering data from 16,566 primary health care teams across 3,857 municipalities in Brazil, which were surveyed in the first cycle of the Brazilian National Programme for the Improvement of Access to and Quality of Primary Health Care (PMAQ-AB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. This data were made publicly available by the PHC Department of the Ministry of Health (Departamento de Atenção Básica do Ministério da Saúde -DAB/MS). To form the theoretical construct for antenatal care quality, we used criteria and standards from Brazilian legislation and scientific evidence to identify the main questions from the first cycle of the PMAQ-AB external evaluation survey (Modules I and II) related to maternal and child care at the PHC level. Based on a normative approach and following Brazilian standards for Antenatal Care quality, a list of variables from the PMAQ survey were grouped into ten binary indicators (adequate/inadequate), which, in turn, were used to form the theoretical construct for Antenatal Care Quality (ANC). In general, if the health teams declared to have provided inputs and carried out actions in alignment with PHC standards in Brazil, the indicator was classified as adequate. Each of these ten indicators captured a relevant aspect of Antenatal Care, including supplies, like the availability of diagnostic tests and medicines, and work processes, such as the availability of ANC consultations, management of high-risk pregnancies, and community outreach. More details on the ten indicators are available in Additional file 1. For the representation of the theoretical model for antenatal care quality in PHC in Brazil, we present the path diagram in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, considering the conventional system for the visual depiction of the relations, in which the ellipses represent latent constructs, rectangles represent observed variables (CFA indicators here) and the directional arrows (→) express the relationships between latent and observed variables, which are captured through the factor loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>Step-by-Step Tutorial for CFA and BCFA The syntax for CFA requires specifying the nature of the indicators (in this case, binary) and the estimation procedure. The R software runs in a variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS, providing a variety of options for estimation methods with varying capabilities. We have not identified any publication that provides an overview of the estimation methods and capabilities of the R (version 4.1.2) and Mplus (version 8.6) software for implementing CFA with binary indicators.</p><p>Tutorial in R R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics tools, and its lavaan package aims to provide methodology related to latent variable modeling, particularly for continuous variables, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis and structural equation modeling. However, estimation methods for dealing with binary indicators in CFA and SEM are also available <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Next we present step-by-step CFA implementation using the lavaan package, which is illustrated using our data on quality of antenatal care (Steps 1A-1E ).</p><p>Step 1A: Specifying the CFA model: To define CFA in lavaan, we must relate the latent variable to its indicators using the operator "=∼", which means "as measured by". For example, in our data, to define CFA to the latent variable ANC (Antenatal Care), we specify all indicators showed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, such that ''ANC =∼ diagnostic tests + high risk + medicines + rapid tests + spont demand + patient flows + record keeping + program offer + guidelines + community outreach"</p><p>Step 1B: Tuning the model: The cfa() function is used, with the first argument defining the user-specified model. The second argument is the dataset that contains the observed variables, which is called Quality in our application. The argument ordered is also used to specify that the indicators are categorical (binary, polytomous or ordinal). The variance-adjusted Weighted Least Squares (WLSMV) estimator, which is usually recommended for analyzing binary indicators, is specified via the argument estimator.</p><p>Step 1C: Displaying summary output: Once the model has been fitted, the summary() function provides a nice summary of the fitted model (degrees of freedom, factor loading estimates and standard errors, covariances between latent variables, thresholds, etc...). To obtain the goodness of fit measures, use the option fitMeasures=TRUE, which can be displayed separately using the function fitMeasures=( ). Additionally, the standardization=TRUE option provides standardized factor loadings for the measurement model.</p><p>Step 1D: Displaying CFA scores: The factors/latent variables described by CFA can be captured by using the function predict().</p><p>Step 1E: Computing reliability measures: An extension of the functionality of the R package lavaan is provided by the package semTools. There are several sets of tools in this package, including the reliability() function that provides reliability measures, including AVE and Alpha ordinal <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>The blavaan package uses similar syntax to the lavaan package for fitting BCFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Its implementation with our data is specified through Steps 2A-2E.</p><p>Step 2A: Setup of the priors: After specifying the model, priors must be defined. The function dpriors contains the package's default priors. The argument lambda is used to specify the prior distribution of factor loadings. For our data, the specified priors are stored in an object named mydp.</p><p>Step 2B: Tuning the model: The function bcfa() is used with argument dp to specify the prior distribution, that is, the object mydp. Similarly to cfa(), the argument ordered is specified alongside the option data, which indicates the dataset that contains the observed variables (indicators).</p><p>Step 2C: Displaying summary output: After model fitting in the previous step, estimates and convergence diagnostics are available through the summary() function. The standardization=TRUE option provides the standardized factor loadings of the measurement model.</p><p>Step 2D: Displaying BCFA scores: The scores generated by BCFA are obtained through the blavPredict() function and the type="lv" option must be specified to obtain the estimated values for the latent variables.</p><p>Step 2E: Plotting diagnostic graphs: Additionally, the bayesplot package in R provides several types of convergence graphs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tutorial in MPlus</head><p>Mplus, on the other hand, is one of the most complete statistical modeling programs that is currently available for modeling latent variables, including analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, with methods allowing analysis with missing data, multilevel structure, survival analysis, among other features. It provides researchers with flexible tools, in terms of choice of models, estimators, algorithms, graphical displays of data and analysis results. Additionally, it allows analyses for observed variables that are continuous, censored, binary, ordered categorical (ordinal), unordered categorical (nominal), counts, or combinations of these variable types <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>The Mplus syntax is organized in sections defined by a language based on a set of 10 basic commands <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. A file with .INP extension should be fully organized before the analysis is requested in Mplus. For CFA implementation with our data, the main (mandatory) setup into the .INP file is specified in Steps 3A-3E.</p><p>Step 3A: Data Setup: First, the name of the dataset that contains the indicators should be specified under DATA:. For our example, we also added the following information: FILE IS Quality.txt. If no additional path is provided, Mplus reads the dataset from the same directory as where the input file is.</p><p>Step 3B: Reading information from the dataset: The names of all variables that are included in the dataset should be specified in the same order they appear in the columns of the dataset. Thus, the following commands should be used: VARIABLE: NAMES ARE ..... If not all variables are used in the analysis, an additional command should be included to select the names of those variables as: USEVARIABLES ARE ..... When using categorical (binary or polytomous) indicators in CFA, we should also add the list of these variables by specifying: CATEGORICAL ARE ....</p><p>Step 3C: Choosing the estimator: It is defined using the command ANALYSIS: ESTIMATOR = WLSMV.</p><p>Step 3D: Specifying CFA model: The measurement model shoud be explicited using the command MODEL:, including a name for the latent variable (ANC in our example) and the separator BY, followed by the list of observed binary indicators.</p><p>Step 3E: Displaying summary output: Mplus provides an output file (with extension .OUT) containing statistics of the fitted model, which includes standardized and unstandardized factor loadings, and goodness-of-fit statistics. Additional information, such as confidence intervals (option cinterval) can be requested using the command OUTPUT:.</p><p>Step 3F: Displaying CFA scores: Factor scores (fscores) can be saved into a text file (called scores-ANC.txt in our example) using the command SAVEDATA:, which can be read by Mplus or any other statistical software.</p><p>For implementation of BCFA in Mplus, Steps 3A-3B and Steps 4A-4B are exactly the same. In Steps 4C-4E we highlight the differences between CFA and BCFA.</p><p>Step 4C: Choosing the estimator: The Bayesian approach is specified under the command ANALYSIS: and the option ESTIMATOR = BAYES.</p><p>Step 4D: Prior setup: Prior distributions must be specified using the commands MODEL: and MODEL PRIORS:. The same prior distribution might be specified for all parameters as a1-a10 ∼ N(0,10). In our example there are 10 indicators, therefore a1-a10 are assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 10. If needed, the specification of the prior distributions can can also be specified separately for each parameter using a1, ...,a10 with a semicolon (;) after each parameter setup.</p><p>Step 4E: Displaying estimates: By default the point estimates are given by the median of the posterior distribution. To obtain the mean or mode of the posterior distribution instead, the option POINT=MEAN (or MEDIAN, MODE) of the command ANALYSIS should be included.</p><p>Step 4F: Displaying BCFA scores: The option NDATASETS=1 in the DATA IMPUTATION command is used to specify the number of plausible values to be saved by using the option SAVE. In our example, a set of plausible values is saved into the file with the imput prefix. The factor scores imputed by the Bayesian approach are called plausible values in Mplus. They are constituted by values randomly drawn from the posterior distribution of the factors generated by MCMC for each individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Other way to save the factor scores into a dataset is through the command SAVEDATA:. The number of sets of scores to be saved must be specified into the parentheses of the option SAVE FSCORES(). The name of the files including BCFA scores are specified using the FILE = option. In our example, the scores are saved in files named as scores ANC*.dat. The asterisk (*) in the FILE=scores ANC*.dat statement is replaced with the dataset number.</p><p>Step 4G: Plotting diagnostic graphs: Convergence graphs are obtained using the command PLOT: with the option TYPE = PLOT3. For detailed information regarding these convergence graphs see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Several other options are available to provide information about the number of iterations and chains, as well as numbers of processors to be used for parallel computing. Interested readers should consult the Mplus manual <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> as well as other relevant literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> systematizes and compares several computational aspects of the implementation of CFA and BCFA in the R and Mplus software. Detailed syntax to replicate the CFA and BCFA analyses to the antenatal care quality application data in both software is available in a GitHub repository: <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7842363">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7842363</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Descriptive statistics for all binary indicators used for the measurement model for antenatal care quality are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> of the Additional file 3. Similar standardized and unstandardized estimates of the factor loadings, factor scores and goodness-of-fit measures for CFA are provided in both software. The standardized factor loadings and corresponding residual variances obtained using the WLSMV estimation method are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. All indicators are positively associated with the ANC construct, with the greatest contribution from the "Welcoming spontaneous demand" indicator (stand.estimate= 0.699). The estimated (unstandardized) probit coefficient for the indicator "Spontaneous demand" is equal to 1.852 and can be interpreted as: for a one-unit increase in the true (latent) measure of the ANC construct, the z-score underlying the latent score of "Welcoming spontaneous demand" increases by 1.852. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al. (2021)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for more details about such interpretation. It is noteworthy that the factor loadings of all the indicators were statistically significant, that is, all indicators had a statistically significant contribution to the construct. The goodness-of-fit measures for the ANC quality CFA include a RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) of 0.04, which measures the mean difference between the observed and model-based covariance matrix, indicating an appropriate fit. Additionally, the values for the Comparative Fit Index (CFI = 0.963) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI = 0.952) presented acceptable values, greater than 0.95. Regarding reliability measures, Cronbach's Alpha value is greater than 0.8 and the AVE is greater than 0.3, so within acceptable limits. It is noteworthy that MPlus does not provide reliability measures of the constructs.</p><p>We were not able to fit the BCFA in the R software for our data, probably because all indicators are binary and the dataset is large. However, it was easily implemented in MPLUS. The median estimates were quite similar to those from the frequentist approach. The BCFA estimates and their 95% credibility intervals are displayed in in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> of the Additional file 3.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates some of the graphs provided by Mplus for evaluation of model convergence, including posterior distribution density (A) trace plots of the iterations (B), autocorrelation (chains 1 and 2, respectively) of the iterations (C and D) for the indicator Community outreach. Note in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(A) that this density approximates the normal distribution. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(B) we verify that the traces of the iterations present a narrow and horizontal band without major oscillations along the chain, which is indicative of convergence. The autocorrelation graphs for both chains decay rapidly, indicating that the dependence of the chain via MCMC was very low, that is, the estimates are not being affected by initial values in the chain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). It is noteworthy that the other parameters showed similar behavior. The results presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> were obtained using the default prior distributions in MPlus. Nevertheless, similar results were observed when conducting the sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis regarding prior distributions was conducted by varying the prior variance hyperparameter of the factor loadings (5, 10, 100 and 1000). No substantial changes were identified in these analysis as showed by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. In contrast to the BCFA scores, the CFA scores do not have outliers. Nevertheless, all scores show a symmetrical behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is an approach widely used to validate questionnaires that aim to capture unobserved measures, and there is an extensive list of possibilities of applications in health, including topics such as health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, breastfeeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and impact of COVID-19 in mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. However, when considering Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis, a much smaller number of articles were found using this methodology, including one that evaluated a scale for a chronic condition self-management tool in cirrhotic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> and another that validated an instrument to assess the distress in patients diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>Binary data are common in many applied research studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. The WLSMV estimation method for CFA is defined as the "gold standard" for measurement models with binary indicators and it was applied in our analyses, but other methods are available and can be easily used in both software <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The implementation of CFA with binary indicators in the R and Mplus software is trivial. Both provide standardized and unstandardized estimates of factor loadings, factor scores and goodness-of-fit measures. However, Mplus does not provide reliability measures for the constructs. Recently, Bayesian versions of reliability measures have been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Although implementing the binary CFA is simple and straightforward, interpreting its results might be challenging. This is due to the dependence of binary CFA models on an underlying continuous distribution of the latent variable, as opposed to just the observed indicator. That is, each indicator is associated with a standard normal random variable, denoted previously by y * . In this context, the corresponding unstandardized estimate indicates that for a one-unit increase in the true (latent) measure of the construct, the z-score underlying the indicator increases by that amount. With regard to model fit, most indicators (specifically RMSEA, SRMR, CFI and TLI) can be interpreted in the same way for continuous and binary CFA models. However, an alternative chi-square difference test should be used to compare nested binary CFA models <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian modeling is relatively complex. It should be noted that, unlike the CFA, factor loadings from BCFA are interpreted in terms of the mean (median or mode) values of the standardized posterior distributions. Details about BCFA with continuous indicators are provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Depaoli (2021)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, there is a scarcity of literature when indicators are binary. Additionaly, the correct specification of priors is one of the main challenges when using BCFA. In certain situations, noninformative priors can unintentionally behave like highly informative priors. A recent tutorial warns about the impact of using default priors (within R software) with small sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Despite that, the implementation of BCFA with binary indicators in software does not require great expertise. Unfortunately we faced some caveats/limitations for our data analyses with binary indicators in the current version of R.</p><p>We sucessfully provided inputs and outputs considering a step-by-step process for implementation of CFA and BCFA with binary indicators using R and Mplus software. The flexibility, advantages and limitations of such analyses have also been presented. With this tutorial, we hope to assist researchers in the correct implementation of frequentist and Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Path Diagram for Antenatal Care Quality in PHC, Brazil, 2011.</figDesc><graphic coords="7,160.15,487.56,274.96,176.17" type="bitmap" /></figure>
