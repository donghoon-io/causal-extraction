<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For the prediction of material's properties and of interaction of molecules with the surroundings, one needs to know their properties. Usually, the molecular properties are revealed through experimental measurements. It can be a tedious, time-consuming, and costly work. On the other hand, computational chemistry readily generates a huge number of data which can provide various molecular descriptors. These can be various observable properties (bond lengths and angles, dipole moments, etc...), but also the unobservable properties (partial atomic charges, electronegativity, various latent variables ..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>..).</head><p>There is an urgent need to develop accurate and economical screening tools that predict potential toxicity and environmental burden of various chemicals. Equally important is the design of safer alternatives. Molecular modeling methods offer one of several complementary approaches to evaluate the risk to human health and the environment as a result of exposure to environmental chemicals. These tools can streamline the hazard assessment process by simulating possible modes of action and providing virtual screening tools that can help prioritize bioassay requirements. Tailoring these strategies to the particular challenges presented by environmental chemical interactions make them even more effective. Advances in the fields of computational chemistry and molecular toxicology in recent decades allow the development of predictive models that inform the design of molecules with reduced potential to be toxic to humans or to the environment. As an example we present the novel methodology for the computational evaluation of pK a values of various organic bases, based on calculation of partial atomic charges by a simple semiempirical QM method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, chemists are traditionally aware of their society's responsibilities. Modern society is full of potential hazards. For many of those hazards we need public policies that protect us.</p><p>Almost everything we do to improve our living has a downside.

Atmospheric aerosols affect our life in a number of ways, both in terms of their effect on health and due to their effect on climate patterns.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref>. Human beings live in changing environments in which some factors change very rapidly and others more slowly. Organisms must adapt themselves to these changes if they are to survive and reproduce. A specific aspect of the adaptation is the mechanism by which organisms try to maintain homeostasis in respect to the chemical environment. Organisms are endowed with the enzyme machinery which disposes of chemicals that have entered the body. These enzymes are called drug-or xenobioticmetabolizing enzymes and they have been dealt with in numerous monographs, review articles, and symposia during the past 30 years or so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug</head><p>toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>. Physico-chemical indicators have been increasingly used during the early stages of drug discovery to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the key properties that affect the biological functions(i.e. ADMEabsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). The most commonly measured physicochemical properties are permeability and solubility (due to their importance in the gastrointestinal absorption of orally administered drugs), and also lipophilicity, integrity, and stability (since these properties generally define the pharmaceutical potential of a compound). Often, the ADME concept is expanded by toxicity. Apparently, this potential hazardous quality of new molecular entry (NME) should be taken into account with no less care than possible therapeutic effects.</p><p>There are several end points that relate to potential hazardous effects (such as the liver effects of drug candidates; cardiac toxicity, and blood-brain barrier of compounds that has influence upon both drug efficiency and drug toxicity) which should be estimated during the early stages of drug discovery. Finally carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of a drug also should be estimated during the initial stages of drug discovery.</p><p>Due to huge cost and time necessary for research and development related to drug design, many in silico methods have been developed to provide accurate prediction of pharmacokinetic properties, such as Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET), in very early stage of drug discovery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>. Computational molecular modeling methods aid the risk assessment process by providing a rational approach for some extrapolations in the evaluation of chemical hazard. For instance, when elements of a data set required for evaluating the potential hazard of a chemical are unavailable and inferences can be made based on interactions with putative targets, molecular modeling can be used to simulate the relevant missing information. Both ligand and structure-based molecular modeling methods used in pharmaceutical discovery can be adapted to provide this type of simulated data. However, because of the greater diversity of chemical space and binding affinity domains being considered and the differences in the strategic application of the results (the need to minimize false negatives), these molecular modeling strategies require additional considerations when assessing chemical hazards. Molecular docking of potential environmental chemicals to putative macromolecular targets for toxicity provides a measure of their capacity to interact and hence is an aid in the (pre)screening process for specific modes of toxicity. These results provide a rationale for developing further, more complete testing strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12]</ref>. The approach differs from QSAR in that rather than predicting a toxicity value or a threshold, it elucidates the probability that a compound with particular properties will exhibit a certain toxicity profile. Thus, the approach does not yield deterministic values, but rather probabilistic information about whether a chemical is likely to exhibit toxicity above or below a certain threshold value. The output of this approach can help reduce in vitro and in vivo testing by using key properties to define a highprobability safe chemical space of low to no toxicity. Further, by using property-based criteria as opposed to QSAR descriptors, informed design decisions can more readily be pursued for modifications to reduce potential toxicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[13]</ref>. A complete set of regulatory tests for a single chemical (including those for carcinogenicity and for chronic, reproductive, and development toxicity) uses thousands of animals and costs millions of dollars. In addition, traditional animal tests often yield limited information on mechanism of action, and hence on the cellular pathways that could lead to toxicity in humans. Such mechanistic information is crucial to move beyond default approaches for extrapolating from high-dose animal toxicity tests to estimation of human risk at realistic exposure levels. There is a pressing need to screen the large backlog of chemicals for their potential toxicity and, ultimately, their contribution to human diseases. The ability to use molecular and computational sciences holds the potential to usher in a new era of prioritizing, assessing, and managing chemicals.</p></div>

The bioconcentration factor (BCF) is an important bioaccumulation hazard assessment metric in many regulatory contexts. Its assessment is required by the REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and by CLP (Classification, Labeling and Packaging) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oral Bioavailability</head><p>Prediction. Drug bioavailability is a key aspect often evaluated with in silico models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>. It comprises the assessment of common physico-chemical properties such as solubility <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref> or pK a , which describe the substance regardless of the biological environment. Moreover, interactions with the biological system are also evaluated, such as intestinal permeabilityError! Bookmark not defined. (with models derived on the basis of in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref>, or in vitro data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref>). Interest is now growing also in the role of active transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[19]</ref> together with passive diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Biological Clogging <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref>. The biological clogging of natural porous media, often in conjunction with physical or chemical clogging, is encountered under a wide range of conditions. Wastewater disposal, artificial groundwater recharge, in situ bioremediation of contaminated aquifers, construction of water reservoirs, or secondary oil recovery, are all affected by this process. This is closely related to the study of membrane permeation, the important issue in process industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref>, biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, etc… All these (and many other) studies require sophisticated procedures and considerable human and material resources. The innumerable variety of chemical compounds renders the task of checking every compound, impossible. Therefore, a number of models were developed to enable relatively quick and (as much as possible) credible assessment of environmental impact, toxicity, and stability of compounds. The most successful are the models using the descriptors derived from the structure of the molecule. A single, or combination of several molecular descriptors, proved to be dependable proxies for molecular and material properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE -ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS (QSAR)</head><p>Molecular descriptors are numerical indexes encoding some information related to the molecular structure. They can be both experimental physicochemical properties of molecules and theoretical indexes calculated by mathematical formulas or computational algorithms.</p><p>The main tool for modeling behavior of molecules and materials is quantitative correlation of structure and (re)activity (QSAR). Because the observable properties of molecules usually require tedious measurements, it is convenient to relate structure of molecule with macroscopic measurable properties (QSPR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(re)activity of compound = f(molecular structure) (1)</head><p>A first model of this kind was formulated by Hammett <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[25]</ref>. It was originally formulated for the prediction of dissociation constants of benzoic acids</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">σ X = log K X -log K H (2)</formula><p>where X denotes the substituent on benzene ring.</p><p>Although the Hammett methodology has been criticized by theoreticians because of its empirical foundation, it is astonishing that constants, obtained simply from the ionization of organic acids in solution, can frequently predict successfully equilibrium and rate constants for a variety of families of reactions in solution. Almost every kind of organic reaction has been treated via the Hammett equation, or its extended form. The literature is so voluminous and extensive that there is no complete review of all that has been accomplished <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Analogous approach was formulated by Free and Wilson for the assessment of biological activity of compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[27]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log(1/C) = Σ a j X ij + μ (3)</formula><p>where a j is group contribution of structural element X in position j in molecule i. Constant μ is theoretical biological activity of referent compound.</p><p>Another, widely used model is proposed by Hansch <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>log(1/C) = A×logP + B×σ + C×E s + D (4)</head><p>where LogP describes the lipophilicity of whole molecule, but could be replaced with lipophilic parameter of substituent, π if a congener series of compounds is considered; σ are Hammett parameters of substituent electronic effects; E s are Taft steric parameters of substituents. All (and many other) parameters could be derived from computational results on molecules (computed molecular descriptors).</p><p>Therefore, the quantitative correlation between molecular structure and some measurable property of molecule or material is usually obtained through (multiple) regression analysis involving several/various molecular descriptors.</p><p>The health and environmental concerns are most frequently related to toxicity of compounds.</p><p>When dealing with in silico models for toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref> we can distinguish methods which address the overall toxic phenomenon, for instance carcinogenicity, and methods which address factors of the process leading to toxicity manifestations. Thus, some models address systemic toxicity while others focus on organspecific toxicity. There are in silico models for a large number of toxicity phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref>. Among these genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, although very complex, are among the most extensively studied. However, the availability of a model is different from the reliability of the model prediction. Moreover the possibility to satisfactorily apply a model to a pharmaceutical of interest may depend on toxicological data availability for molecules chemically related to this entity. There are papers in which model performance is assessed for general chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[30]</ref>, or for pharmaceuticals, with respect to carcinogenicity and mutagenicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[31]</ref>. In contrast, there is a paucity of models for developmental or reproductive toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[32]</ref>. In comparison with the models presented above, in silico models for organ-specific effects are generally focused on pharmaceuticals, since data availability is most abundant for drug-like compounds. Among them hepatotoxicity has been frequently investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[33]</ref>, and nowadays increasing interest is also placed on cardiotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[34]</ref> and nephrotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[35]</ref>. Limited models are available for neurotoxicity or other effects such as phospholipidosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[36]</ref>. Some investigations involved the use of adverse effect databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[37]</ref> or combinations of effects against several receptor targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[38]</ref>, using integrated risk indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Regulatory context for in silico models</head><p>The use of in silico methods to estimate toxicity is solicited in different legislation in the EU such as those concerning chemicals or cosmetics. Their use in the pharmaceutical field is more related to the R&amp;D of new drugs avoiding potential adverse effects. Furthermore, regulatory criteria have been defined for the use of in silico predictions in drug safety for the genotoxicity evaluation of drug impurities where the presence or absence of specific structural alerts triggers the subsequent management of potential risk posed by the presence of this impurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">40]</ref>. In this context, new models have been recently proposed to estimate genotoxic or carcinogenic potency in order to estimate safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">41]</ref> Very good results have been obtained in the evaluation of genotoxic impurities in the industrial sector when in silico data were coupled with expert evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[40]</ref> achieving a negative predictive value of 99%.</p><p>There are numerous computational methods for the assessment of the toxicity of compound, and many of them comprise the software packages and databases which are publicly accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MOLECULAR DESCRIPTORS</head><p>Molecular descriptors are formal mathematical representations of a molecule, obtained by a wellspecified algorithm, and applied to a defined molecular representation or a well-specified experimental procedure: the molecular descriptor is the final result of a logic and mathematical procedure which transforms chemical information encoded within a symbolic representation of a molecule into a useful number or the result of some standardized experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[43]</ref>.</p><p>An ideal molecular descriptor should, in numerical form, encode all the features of structure which determine chemical and physical properties, conventionally the constituent atoms, their bonding and spatial relationships, molecular shape and size, and electronics allowing for modifications due to interaction of the molecule with its environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[44]</ref>. In terms of quantum mechanics, the most complete descriptor of molecular structure and properties is the molecular wave function, which characterizes nuclear and electronic properties fully. In principle, the interaction of any molecule with any electromagnetic field can be predicted precisely by solving the appropriate Schrödinger equation. Therefore, all molecular properties (including interactions with biological systems) can be quantified if we know the molecular wave function.</p><p>Thus, molecular descriptors, which are closely connected to the concept of molecular structure, play a fundamental role in scientific research, being the theoretical core of a complex network of knowledge, as is shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[45]</ref> in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In chemistry we deal with various molecular descriptors, which proved to be very useful in prediction of various molecular properties. Traditionally are used melting and boiling points, dipole moments, polarizability, partition coefficients, R f values, and other properties that can be measured. Moreover, various non-measurable properties, like electronegativity, partial atomic charges, and other, were widely used. There is a variety of ways for classification of descriptors; and one classification (far from being exhaustive) is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The measurable descriptors are more valuable because they reflect a genuine property of molecule. Values of non-observable descriptors heavily depend on the definition of them and on the method of their calculation. Determination of measurable descriptors is frequently very tedious and time consuming (e.g. reaction rate constants, equilibrium constants, partition coefficients, etc.), and there is a continuous desire to estimate them using other, much easily reachable descriptors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular descriptors</head><p>Since the computers become widely accessible, computational modeling of molecules becomes a standard procedure in chemical research. Some of the most frequently used, computationally obtained descriptors, are results of quantum-chemical calculations, and are presented on the left column in following list. In the right-hand column are listed some of molecular properties that can be computed on the basis of these descriptors.</p><p>As is previously noted, biological activity, or toxicity of compound have been correlated with various measurable properties like pK a . To extend these studies to new compounds is much easier (and much less expensive) if pK a values can be estimated from data supplied by computational modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[48]</ref>.</p><p>- To demonstrate how the computed data can be used for the evaluation of molecular properties we shall present one (previously not published) study. The pK a values of amines are defined by reaction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Computationally</formula><p>And experimentally can be determined by measuring the concentrations of all reactants and products, what can be done by various physicalchemical methods. It may be costly, and usually require a lot of time. On the other hand we can use some quick quantum chemical method to calculate the versatile descriptors. As a descriptor of interest we choose the partial atomic charges (PAC), because of their recognized importance for the evaluation of the reactivity of compounds. Electronegativity, Hammett rationalization of reactivity, and many other ideas in chemistry strongly rely on idea of PAC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Method of calculation of PAC</head><p>Because partial atomic charges are not observable, it's hard to argue which method of their calculation is the "right" one. Definitions of PAC: Coulson's, Mulliken's, Gasteiger's, Bader's, Hirshfeld's, and other, generally provide similar results, but can sometimes markedly differ. The same is when the calculations are done by different quantum chemical methods. The single rule must be applied -that all calculations have to be done by the same procedure. And only results obtained in the same quantum-chemical frame can be compared.</p><p>For this study a semiempirical MNDO-PM6 method (with simulation of solvent) was applied for calculation of electronic properties of the base's conjugated acids (protonated, aminonium compounds).</p><p>As a basis for the evaluation of pK a values the partial atomic charges on hydrogen (q H ) and nitrogen (q N ) of protonated amino group were used. The correlation was achieved by equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">pK a = A• q H + B•q N + C•I + D (5)</formula><p>This equation contains the index variable I, which has to take in account the effects on pK a values, other than the polarization of NH bond. In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[57]</ref> on aliphatic amines was found that such variable can correspond to the number of hydrogen atoms bound to nitrogen in aminonium ion. The regression analysis was done for 23 organic bases, involving aliphatic and aromatic amines and nitrogen heterocyclic bases, and is presented in Table1. Much effort was invested to verify the accuracy of many experimental values. In diacidic base was frequently hard to identify is the published value the result for mono-, or diprotonated base. In such case we used the already published method <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[49]</ref> for evaluation of dissociation constant of acidsin this case conjugated acids, to distinguish between the dissociation of monoprotonated and diprotonated bases. The experimental results for which was not clear how the measurement was done (solvent, etc.) were discarded.</p><p>It turned out that the index variable that was valid for aliphatic amines is not applicable here.</p><p>The biggest difference is among acyclic and heterocyclic amines without adjacent N atoms (to them can be assigned value I = 1), and aniline analogs having NH 2 group on aromatic ring (to which can be assigned value I = 2.33).</p><p>To heterocycles having adjacent N atoms in the ring could be assigned index variable I = 1.85.</p><p>Tree data points with markers '2' and '4' are outliers of this rule, and were given slightly different I values. For them could be speculated that taking into account the specificity of molecular structure the scattering can be explained. For example, hexamethylene tetramine may have value for I = 1 + log( <ref type="formula">4</ref>  This example illustrates how the use of results about the electronic structure of molecule, i.e., distribution of electron density in it, may provide accurate prediction of various physicochemical properties of molecules. The acidity constants are correlated with many chemical and biological features of molecules, and their measurement is highly enhanced by knowledge of approximate value of them. Various other molecular descriptors can be used, but for efficient correlation one has to choose those which have intrinsic relation to the property in study.</p><p>Many molecular properties is hard to measure and, on the other hand, they are highly useful for the prediction of the behavior of compounds in the environment. Computationally generated molecular descriptors are easily available, and can be exploited to calculate (at least approximately) every molecular observable property.</p><p>Because of their straightforward relation to the distribution of electron density in molecule, the partial atomic charges (regardless of the fact that they are not observable) were proven to be particularly useful proxies to evaluate molecular properties. It enables easy interpretation of results, because the so called 'chemical intuition' is based on the presumed distribution of charges in molecule.</p></div>

This methodology can be efficiently used for assessing the environmental issues, like aquatic toxicity, bioavailability, screening environmental chemicals, bioconcentration factor(s), and others.</p><p>With the advance in computational efficacy, the calculation of hundreds of molecular descriptors is now a routine job. The computationally obtained descriptors are easy to use as proxies for observable properties of molecules.

Obično se osobine molekula otkrivaju eksperimentalnim merenjima. To može biti mukotrpan dugotrajan i skup posao. Sa druge strane, računarska hemija lako daje veliki broj podataka koji mogu da obezbede različite deskriptore molekula. To mogu biti razne merljive veličine (dužine i uglovi veza, dipolni momenti, i sl...), ali i nemerljive osobine (parcijalna atomska naelektrisanja, elektronegativnost, razne latentne varijable ....). Postoji velika potreba za razvijanjem pouzdanih i ekonomičnih načina za skrininge kojima se predskazuje potencijalna otrovnost i opterećenje životne okoline raznim hemikalijama. Jednako važan je i dizajn bezbednijih alternativa. Metode molekulskog modelovanja nude jedan od nekoliko komplementarnih pristupa za procenu rizika za zdravlje ljudi i životne sredine kao posledicu izlaganja hemikalijama u okolišu. Ovim postupcima se može neprekidno vršiti procena opasnosti simuliranjem mogućih načina delovanja, a obezbeđivanje virtualnog skrininga može pomoći u određivanju prioriteta kod bio-eseja. Ukrajanjem ovih strategija u određene izazove interakcija hemikalija i životne sredine može iste učiniti efikasnijima. Napredak u računarskoj hemiji i molekulskoj toksikologiji postignut poslednjih decenija dozvoljava razvoj prediktivnih modela za racionalni dizajn molekula sa umanjenim potencijalom otrovnosti za ljude ili za životnu sredinu.
