<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recommender systems have been widely used in many scenarios to provide personalized items to users over massive vocabularies of items. The core of an effective recommender system is to accurately predict users' interests toward items based on their historical interactions. With the success of deep learning, deep Sequential Recommendation (SR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> models, which aims at dynamically characterizing the behaviors of users with different deep neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, arguably represents the current state-of-theart <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. In general, a deep SR model is trained based on users' interaction behaviors via a deep neural network, assuming users' interests depending on historical behaviors. However, consuming behaviour of users can be affected by other latent factors, i.e., driven by their underlying intents. Consider the example illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Two users purchased a series of different items on Amazon in the past. Given such distinct interaction behaviors, the system will recommend different items to them. However, both of them are fishing enthusiasts and are shopping for fishing activities. As a result, they both purchase 'fishing swivels' in the future. If the system is aware that these two users are shopping for fishing activities, then commonly purchased items for fishing, such as 'fishing swivels' can be suggested. This motivates us to mine underlying intents that are shared across users and use the learnt intents to guide system providing recommendations.</p><p>Precisely discovering the intents of users, however, is underexplored. Most existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> of user intent modeling require side information. ASLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> leverages user action types (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, etc.) to capture users' intentions, whereas such information is not always available in system. CoCoRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> utilizes item category information. But we argue that categorical feature is unable to accurately represents users' intents. For example, intents like 'shopping for holiday gifts' may involve items from multiple different categories. DSSRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposes a seq2seq training strategy, which optimizes the intents in latent spaces. However, those intents in DSSRec are inferred solely based on individual sequence representation, while ignoring the underlying correlations of the intents from different users.</p><p>Effectively modeling latent intents from user behaviors poses two challenges. First, it is extremely difficult to learn latent intents accurately because we have no labelling data for intents. The only available supervision signals for intents are the user behavior data. Nevertheless, as aforementioned example indicates, distinct behaviors may reflect the same intent. Besides, effectively fusing intent information into a SR model is non-trivial. The target in SR is to predict next items in sequences, which is solved by encoding sequences. Leveraging latent intents of sequences into the model requires the intent factors to be orthogonal to the sequence embeddings, which otherwise would induce redundant information.</p><p>To discover the benefits of latent intents and address challenges, we propose the Intent Contrastive Learning (ICL), a general learning paradigm that leverages the latent intent factor into SR. It learns users' intent distributions from all user behavior sequences via clustering. And it leverages the learnt intents into the SR model via a new contrastive SSL, which maximizes the agreement between a view of sequence and its corresponding intent. The intent representation learning module and the contrastive SSL module are mutually reinforced to train a more expressive sequence encoder. We tackle the challenge of intent mining problem by introducing a latent variable to represent users' intents and learn them alternately along with the SR model optimization through an expectation-maximization (EM) framework to ensure convergence. We suggest fusing learnt intent information into SR via the proposed contrastive SSL, as it can improve model's performance as well as robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets further verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning paradigm, which improves performance and robustness, even when recommender systems face heavy data sparsity issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Sequential Recommendation</head><p>Sequential recommendation aims to accurately characterize users' dynamic interests by modeling their past behavior sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Early works on SR usually model an item-to-item transaction pattern based on Markov Chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. FPMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> combines the advantages of Markov Chains and matrix factorization to fuse both sequential patterns and users' general interest.</p><p>With the recent advances of deep learning, many deep sequential recommendation models are also developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and RNNbased <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> models. The recent success of Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> also motivates the developments of pure Transformer-based SR models. SASRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> utilizes unidirectional Transformer to assign weights to each interacted item adaptively. BERT4Rec <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> improves that by utilizing a bidirectional Transformer with a Cloze task <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to fuse user behaviors information from left and right directions into each item. LSAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> improves SASRec on reducing model size perspective. It proposes a temporal context-aware embedding and twin-attention network, which are light weighted. ASReP <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> further alleviates the data-sparsity issue by leveraging a pre-trained Transformer on the revised user behavior sequences to augment short sequences. In this paper, we study the potential of addressing data sparsity issues and improving SR via self-supervised learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">User Intent for Recommendation</head><p>Recently, many approaches have been proposed to study users' intents for improving recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. MCPRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> designs mixture-channel purpose routing networks to adaptively learn users' different purchase purposes of each item under different channels (sub-sequences) for session-based recommendation. MITGNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposes a multi-intent translation graph neural network to mine users' multiple intents by considering the correlations of the intents. ICM-SR <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> designs an intent-guided neighbor detector to retrieve correct neighbor sessions for neighbor representation. Different from session-based recommendation, another line of works focus on modeling the sequential dynamics of users' interaction behaviors in a longer time span. DSSRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposes a seq2seq training strategy using multiple future interactions as supervision and introducing an intent variable from her historical and future behavior sequences. The intent variable is used to capture mutual information between an individual user's historical and future behavior sequences. Two users of similar intents might be far away in representation space. Unlike this work, our intent variable is learned over all users' sequences and is used to maximize mutual information across different users with similar learned intents. ASLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> captures intent via a temporal convolutional network with side information (e.g., user action types such as click, add-to-favorite, etc.), and then use the learned intents to guide SR model to predict the next item. Instead, our method can learn users' intents based on user interaction data only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning</head><p>Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has brought much attentions by different research communities including CV <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> and NLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, as well as recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. The fundamental goal of contrastive SSL is to maximize mutual information among the positive transformations of the data itself while improving discrimination ability to the negatives. In reccommendation, A two-tower DNN-based contrastive SSL model is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. It aims to improving collaborative filtering based recommendation leveraging item attributes. SGL <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> adopts a multi-task framework with contrastive SSL to improve the graph neural networks (GCN)-based collaborative filtering methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> with only item IDs as features. Specific to SR, S 3 -Rec <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> adopts a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, and utilizes contrastive SSL during pre-training to incorporate correlations among items, sub-sequences, and attributes of a given user behavior sequence. However, the two-stage training strategy prevents the information sharing between next-item prediction and SSL tasks and restricts the performance improvement. CL4SRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and CoSeRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> instead utilize a multi-task training framework with a contrastive objective to enhance user representations. Different from them, our work is aware of users' latent intent factor when leveraging contrastive SSL, which we show to be beneficial for improving recommendation performance and robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PRELIMINARIES 3.1 Problem definition</head><p>Assume that a recommender system has a set of users and items denoted by U and V respectively. Each user 𝑢 ∈ U has a sequence of interacted items sorted in chronological order In practice, sequences are truncated with maximum length 𝑇 .

If the sequence length is less than 𝑇 , 'padding' items will be added to the left until the length is 𝑇 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. For each user 𝑢, the goal of next item prediction task is to predict the next item that the user 𝑢 is most likely to interact with at the |𝑆 𝑢 | + 1 step among the item set V, given sequence S 𝑢 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑆 𝑢 = [𝑠 𝑢 1 , . . . ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Deep SR Models for Next Item Prediction</head><p>Modern sequential recommendation models commonly encode user behavior sequences with a deep neural network to model sequential patterns from (truncated) user historical behavior sequences. Without losing generality, we define a sequence encoder 𝑓 𝜃 (•) that encodes a sequence S 𝑢 and outputs user interest representations over all position steps H 𝑢 = 𝑓 𝜃 (S 𝑢 ). Specially, h 𝑢 𝑡 represents user's interest at position 𝑡. The goal can be formulated as finding the optimal encoder parameter 𝜃 that maximizes the log-likelihood function of the expected next items of given 𝑁 sequences on all positional steps:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝜃 * = arg max 𝜃 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑢=1 𝑇 ∑︁ 𝑡 =2 ln 𝑃 𝜃 (𝑠 𝑢 𝑡 ).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>which is equivalent to minimizing the adapted binary crossentropy loss as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L NextItem = 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑢=1 𝑇 ∑︁ 𝑡 =2 L NextItem (𝑢, 𝑡),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">L NextItem (𝑢, 𝑡) = -log(𝜎 (h 𝑢 𝑡 -1 • s 𝑢 𝑡 )) - ∑︁ 𝑛𝑒𝑔 log(1 -𝜎 (h 𝑢 𝑡 -1 • s 𝑢 𝑛𝑒𝑔 )),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where s 𝑢 𝑡 and s 𝑢 𝑛𝑒𝑔 denote the embeddings of the target item 𝑠 𝑡 and all items not interacted by 𝑢. The sum operator in Eq. 3 is computationally expensive because |𝑉 | is large. Thus we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> to use a sampled softmax technique to randomly sample a negative item for each time step in each sequence. 𝜎 is the sigmoid function. And 𝑁 is refers to the mini-batch size as the SR model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Contrastive SSL in SR</head><p>Recent advances in contrastive SSL have inspired the recommendation community to leverage contrastive SSL to fuse correlations among different views of one sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, following the mutual information maximization (MIM) principle. Existing approaches in SR can be seen as instance discrimination tasks that optimize a lower bound of MIM, such as InfoNCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. It aims to optimize the proportion of gap of positive pairs and negative pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In such an instance discrimination task, sequence augmentations such as 'mask', 'crop', or 'reorder' are required to create different views of the unlabeled data in SR <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr">52]</ref>. Formally, given a sequence 𝑆 𝑢 , and a pre-defined data transformation function set G, we can create two positive views of 𝑆 𝑢 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S𝑢 1 = 𝑔 𝑢 1 (𝑆 𝑢 ), S𝑢 2 = 𝑔 𝑢 2 (𝑆 𝑢 ), s.t. 𝑔 𝑢 1 , 𝑔 𝑢 2 ∼ G,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑔 𝑢 1 and 𝑔 𝑢 2 are transformation functions sampled from G to create a different view of sequence 𝑠 𝑢 . Commonly, views created from the same sequence are treated as positive pairs, and the views of any different sequences are considered as negative pairs. The augmented views are first encoded with the sequence encoder 𝑓 𝜃 (•) to H𝑢 1 and H𝑢 2 , and then be fed into an 'Aggregation' layer to get vector representations of sequences, denoted as h𝑢 1 and h𝑢 2 . In this paper, we 'concatenate' users' interest representations over time steps for simplicity. Note that sequences are prepossessed to have the same length (See Sec. 3.1), thus their vector representations after concatenation have the same length too. After that, we can optimize 𝜃 via InfoNCE loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L SeqCL = L SeqCL ( h𝑢 1 , h𝑢 2 ) + L SeqCL ( h𝑢 2 , h𝑢 1 ),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L SeqCL ( h𝑢 1 , h𝑢 2 ) = -log exp(sim( h𝑢 1 , h𝑢 2 )) 𝑛𝑒𝑔 exp(sim( h𝑢 1 , h𝑛𝑒𝑔 )) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 𝑠𝑖𝑚(•) is dot product and h𝑛𝑒𝑔 are negative views' representations of sequence 𝑆 𝑢 .

After that, we can define the distribution function 𝑄 (𝑐 𝑖 ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝑄 (𝑐 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 𝜃 (𝑐 𝑖 |𝑆 𝑢 ) = 1 if 𝑆 𝑢 in cluster 𝑖 0 else.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (b) illustrates how the E-step works.</p><p>4.1.3 Intent Contrastive SSL with FNM. We have estimated the distribution function 𝑄 (𝑐). To maximize Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">11</ref>), we also need to define 𝑃 𝜃 (𝑆 𝑢 , 𝑐 𝑖 ). Assuming that the prior over intents follow the uniform distribution and the conditional distribution of 𝑆 𝑢 given 𝑐 is isotropic Gaussian with 𝐿2 normalization, then we can rewrite 𝑃 𝜃 (𝑆 𝑢 , 𝑐 𝑖 ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">𝑃 𝜃 (𝑆 𝑢 , 𝑐 𝑖 ) = 𝑃 𝜃 (𝑐 𝑖 )𝑃 𝜃 (𝑆 𝑢 |𝑐 𝑖 ) = 1 𝐾 • 𝑃 𝜃 (𝑆 𝑢 |𝑐 𝑖 ) ∝ 1 𝐾 • exp(-(h 𝑢 -c 𝑖 ) 2 ) 𝐾 𝑗=1 exp(-(h 𝑢 𝑖 -c 𝑗 ) 2 ) ∝ 1 𝐾 • exp(h 𝑢 • c 𝑖 ) 𝐾 𝑗=1 exp(h 𝑢 • c 𝑗 ) ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where h 𝑢 and c 𝑢 are vector representations of 𝑆 𝑢 and 𝑐 𝑖 , respectively. Based on Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">13</ref>), maximizing Eq.

We can see that Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">14</ref>) has a similar form as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), where Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) tries to maximize mutual information between two individual sequences. While Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">14</ref>) maximizes mutual information between one individual sequence and its corresponding intent. Note that, sequence augmentations are required in SeqCL to create positive views for Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>). While in ICL, sequence augmentations are optional, as the view of a given sequence is its corresponding intent that learnt from original dataset. In this paper, we apply sequence augmentations for enlarging training set purpose and optimize model w.r.t 𝜃 based on Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">14</ref>). Formally, given a batch of training sequences {𝑠 𝑢 } 𝑁 𝑢=1 , we first create two positive views of a sequence via Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), and then optimize the following loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">L ICL = L ICL ( h𝑢 1 , c 𝑢 ) + L ICL ( h𝑢 2 , c 𝑢 ),<label>(15)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">L ICL ( h𝑢 1 , c 𝑢 ) = -log exp(sim( h𝑢 1 , c 𝑢 )) 𝑛𝑒𝑔 exp(sim( h𝑢 1 , c 𝑛𝑒𝑔 )) ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where 𝑐 𝑛𝑒𝑔 are all the intents in the given batch. However, directly optimizing Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">16</ref>) can introduce false-negative samples since users in a batch can have same intent. To mitigate the effects of falsenegatives, we propose a simple strategy to mitigate the effects by not contrasting against them:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">L ICL ( h𝑢 1 , c 𝑢 ) = -log exp(sim( h𝑢 1 , c 𝑢 )) 𝑁 𝑣=1 1 𝑣∉F exp(sim( h1 , c 𝑣 )) , (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>where F is a set of users that have same intent as 𝑢 in the minibatch.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Connections with Contrastive SSL in SR.</head><p>Recent methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> in SR follow standard contrastive SSL to maximize mutual information between two positive views of sequences. For example, CL4SRec encodes sequences with Transformer and maximizes mutual information between two sequences that are augmented (cropping, masking, or reordering) from the original sequence. However, if the item relationships of a sequence are vulnerable to random perturbation, two views of this sequence may not reveal the original sequence correlations. ICLRec maximizes mutual information between a sequence and its corresponding intent prototype. Since the intent prototype can be considered as a positive view of a given sequence that learnt by considering the semantic structures of all sequences, which reflects true sequence correlations, the ICLRec can outperform CL4SRec consistently. Fortunately, the model can be effectively parallelized because 𝑓 𝜃 is Transformer and we leave it in future work. In the testing phase, the proposed ICL as well as the SeqCL objectives are no longer needed, which yields the model to have the same time complexity as SASRec (𝑂 (𝑑 |𝑉 |)). The empirical time spending comparisons are reported in Sec. 5.2. The convergence of ICL is guaranteed under the generalized EM framework. Proof is provided in Appendix B.</p></div>

We do not directly compare ASLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, as it requires user action type information (e.g., click, add-tofavorite, etc). Instead, we provide a case study in Sec. 5.6 to evaluate the benefits of the learnt intent factor with additional item category information.</p><p>5.1.4 Implementation Details. Caser 3 , BERT4Rec<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> , and S3-Rec<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> are provided by the authors.

We implement SASRec and CL4SRec in PyTorch. The mask ratio in BERT4Rec is tuned from {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}. The number of attention heads and number of self-attention layers for all self-attention based methods (SASRec, S 3 -Rec, CL4SRec, DSSRec) are tuned from {1, 2, 4}, and {1, 2, 3}, respectively. The number of latent factors introduced in DSSRec is tuned from {1, 2, . . . , 8}.</p><p>Our method is implemented in PyTorch. Faiss<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> is used for 𝐾means clustering to speed up the training and query stages.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Performance Comparison</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> shows the results of different methods on all datasets. We have the following observations. First, BPR performs worse than sequential models in general, which indicates the importance of mining the sequential patterns under user behavior sequences. As for standard sequential models, SASRec utilizes a Transformerbased encoder and achieves better performance than Caser and GRU4Rec. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Transformer for capturing sequential patterns. DSSRec further improves SASRec's performance by using a seq2seq training strategy and reconstructs the representation of the future sequence in latent space for alleviating non-convergence problems.</p><p>Moreover, though BERT4Rec and S 3 -Rec and adopt SSL to provide additional training signals to enhance representations , we observe that both of them exhibit worse performance than SASRec in some datasets (e.g., in the Toys dataset). The reason might be that both BERT4Rec and S 3 -Rec aim to incorporate context information of given user behavior sequences via masked item prediction. Such a goal may not align well with the next item prediction target, and it requires that each user behavior sequence is long enough to provide comprehensive 'context' information. Thus their performances are degenerated when most sequences are short. Besides, S 3 -Rec is proposed to fuse additional contextual information. Without such features, its two-stage training strategy prevents information sharing between the next-item prediction and SSL tasks, thus leading to poor results. CL4SRec consistently performs better than other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of enhancing sequence representations via contrastive SSL on an individual user level.</p><p>Finally, ICLRec consistently outperforms existing methods on all datasets. The average improvements compared with the best baseline ranges from 7.47% to 33.33% in HR and NDCG. The proposed ICL estimates a good distribution of intents and fuses them into SR model by a new contrastive SSL, which helps the encoder discover a good semantic structure across different user behavior sequences.</p><p>We also report the model efficiency on Sports. SASRec is the most efficient solution. It spends 3.59 s/epoch on model updates. CL4SRec and the proposed ICLRec spend 6.52 and 11.75 s/epoch,  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Robustness Analysis</head><p>Robustness w.r.t. user interaction frequency. The user 'coldstart' problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> is one of the typical data-sparsity issues that recommender systems often face, i.e., most users have limited historical behaviors. To check whether ICL improves the robustness under such a scenario, we split user behavior sequences into three groups based on their behavior sequences' length, and keep the total number of behavior sequences the same. Models are trained and evaluated on each group of users independently. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref> shows the comparison results on four datasets. We observe that: (1) The proposed ICLRec can consistently performs better than SASRec among all user groups while CL4SRec fails to outperform SAS-Rec in Beauty and Yelp when user behavior sequences are short. This demonstrates that CL4SRec requires individual user behavior sequences long enough to provide 'complete' information for auxiliary supervision while ICLRec reduces the need by leveraging user intent information, thus consistently benefiting user representation learning even when users have limited historical interactions.</p><p>(2) Compared with CL4SRec, we observe that the improvement of ICLRec is mainly because it provides better recommendations to users with low interaction frequency. This verifies that user intent information is beneficial, especially when the recommender system faces data-sparsity issues where information in each individual user sequence is limited.  Robustness to Noisy Data. We also conduct experiments on the Sports and Yelp datasets to verify the robustness of ICLRec against noisy interactions in the test phase. Specifically, we randomly add a certain proportion (i.e., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) of negative items to text sequences. From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> we can see that adding noisy data deteriorates the performance of CL4SRec and ICLRec. However, the performance drop ratio of ICLRec is consistently lower than CL4SRec, and its performance with 15% noise proportion can still outperforms CL4SRec without noisy dataset on Sports. The reason might be the leveraged intent information is collaborative information that distilled from all the users. ICL helps the SR model capture semantic structures from user behavior sequences, which increases the robustness of ICLRec to noisy perturbations on individual sequences. Since ICL is a model-agostic learning paradigm, we also add ICL to the S 3 -Rec 𝐼𝑆𝑃 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> model in the fine-tuning stage to further verify its effectiveness. Results are shown in Table . 2 (G)-(H). We find that the S 3 -Rec 𝐼𝑆𝑃 model also benefits from the ICL objective. The average improvement over the four datasets is 41.11% in NDCG@20, which further validate the effectiveness and practicality of ICLRec. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Hyper-parameter Sensitivity</head><p>The larger of the intent class number 𝐾 means users can have more diverse intentions. The larger value of the strength of SeqCL objective 𝛽 means the ICL task contributes more to the final model. The results on Yelp is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>. We find that: (1) ICLRec reaches its best performance when increasing 𝐾 to 512, and then it starts to deteriorate as 𝐾 become larger. When 𝐾 is very small, the number of users under each intent prototype can potentially be large. As a result, false-positive samples (i.e., users that actually have different intents are considered as having the same intent erroneously) are introduced to the contrastive SSL, thus affecting learning. On the other hand, when 𝐾 is too large, the number of users under each intent prototype is small, the introduced falsenegative samples will also impair contrastive SSL. In Yelp, 512 user intents summarize users' distinct behaviors best. (2) A 'sweet-spot' of 𝜆 = 0.5 can also be found. It indicates that the ICL task can benefit the recommendation prediction as an auxiliary task. The impact of the batch size and 𝛽 are provided in Appendix D.  </p></div>

The impact of 𝛽 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref>. We can see that, 𝛽 does help ICLRec improve the performance when it is small (e.g., 𝛽 ≤ 0.1).

This phenomenon also indicates the limitation of SeqCL, since focusing on maximize mutual information between individual sequence pairs may break the global relationships among users. </p></div>

Detailed analyses show the superiority of ICL and experiments conducted on four datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. for sequential recommendation with mutual information maximization.

We observe that with the batch size increases, CL4SRec's performance does not continually improve. The reason might because of larger batch sizes introduce false-negative samples, which harms learning. While ICLRec is relatively stable with different batch sizes, and out performs CL4SRec in all circumstances. Because the intent learnt can be seen as a pseudo label of sequences, which helps identify the true positive samples via the proposed contrastive SSL with FNM.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Dataset</cell><cell cols="2">Sports Beauty</cell><cell>Toys</cell><cell>Yelp</cell></row><row><cell>|U|</cell><cell>35,598</cell><cell>22,363</cell><cell cols="2">19,412 30,431</cell></row><row><cell>|V |</cell><cell>18,357</cell><cell>12,101</cell><cell cols="2">11,924 20,033</cell></row><row><cell># Actions</cell><cell>0.3m</cell><cell>0.2m</cell><cell>0.17m</cell><cell>0.3m</cell></row><row><cell>Avg. length</cell><cell>8.3</cell><cell>8.9</cell><cell>8.6</cell><cell>8.3</cell></row><row><cell>Sparsity</cell><cell cols="4">99.95% 99.95% 99.93% 99.95%</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">D IMPACT OF BATCH SIZE AND THE</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">STRENGTH OF SEQCL TASK 𝛽</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
