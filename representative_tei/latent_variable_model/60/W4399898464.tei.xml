<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Developing machine learning (ML) methods for healthcare predictive modeling requires absolute explainability and transparency to build trust and accountability. Graphical models (GM) are key tools for this but face challenges like small sample sizes, mixed variables, and latent confounders. This paper presents a novel learning framework addressing these challenges by integrating latent variables using fast causal inference (FCI), accommodating mixed variables with predictive permutation conditional independence tests (PPCIT), and employing a systematic graphical embedding approach leveraging expert knowledge. This method ensures a transparent model structure and an explainable approach to feature selection and modeling, achieving competitive prediction performance. For real-world validation, data on hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) among individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) were used, where the approach achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.941 and an AUC of 0.983, outperforming most benchmarks. The PPCIT method also demonstrated superior accuracy and scalability over other benchmarks in causal discovery validation on synthetic datasets that closely resemble our real dataset. This holistic framework effectively addresses the challenges of mixed variables and explainable predictive modeling for disease onset, which is crucial for enabling transparency and interpretability in ML-based healthcare.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The increasing interest in applying machine learning (ML) methodologies to healthcare is driven by their potential to transform patient care and decision-making processes fundamentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . However, with the increasing use of ML in healthcare, intricacies have emerged, particularly concerning explainability and transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . In precision medicine and disease prediction, there is an imperative need for ML models that are not only accurate but also transparent, interpretable, and accountable. The significance of explainability and transparency in healthcare stems from the complex nature of medical decisions. The lack of clarity inherent in complex ML models, such as deep neural networks, significantly hinders comprehension and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Therefore, it is essential to make these intricate models accessible to a heterogeneous audience, encompassing healthcare professionals, patients, and regulatory bodies. Achieving this clarity is instrumental in fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and facilitating decision-making in healthcare.</p><p>There has been a proliferation of methodological approaches in developing explainable and transparent ML systems for healthcare. The utilization of graphical modeling, especially when extended to causal models, is particularly notable in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . GM employs probabilistic graphs to succinctly encode statistical relations among multiple variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , aiding in the straightforward interpretation and comprehension of interactions between various factors. This clarity enables stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the structure and relations encoded in the model. Owing to its strengths in aiding interpretation and transparency, GM has found essential applications in diverse fields, including earth science <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and healthcare, particularly in the context of diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</p><p>A causal graphical model (CGM), also known as a causal Bayesian network or causal directed acyclic graph (DAG), is a specialized type of GM aimed to represent causal relationships between variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Unlike traditional GMs that primarily focus on statistical associations, CGMs are intended to depict cause-and-effect relationships. In CGMs, variables are represented as nodes, and the directed edges between these nodes signify causal relationships. This graph structure facilitates the discernment of direct and indirect causes. As a robust framework for analyzing cause and effect, CGMs enable researchers to infer the consequences of interventions and identify the intricate mechanisms by which variables influence one another. The explicit representation of causal relationships in these models is pivotal in distinguishing between correlation and causation, thereby deepening the understanding of complex systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal Discovery with Expert Knowledge:</head><p>The process of learning the causal structure as a graph from observational data is a pivotal area of discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Early efforts in this field utilized constraint-based approaches, such as the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and fast causal inference (FCI) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . These methods exploit conditional independence relationships among variables to infer causal structures. In contrast, score-based approaches, including the greedy equivalence search (GES) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> with a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , focus on finding the optimal causal structure by maximizing a scoring criterion.</p><p>However, data can be informative yet biased, particularly due to the limited sample sizes. To mitigate potential issues arising from small data sets, the Incorporation of expert knowledge is essential. This approach calibrates the learned model with data, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability. Recent studies have explored various methods for incorporating expert or background knowledge into the causal discovery process. These methods include the use of known causal relationships as prior information, the incorporation of domain-specific constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , and the utilization of external knowledge bases to steer causal search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Such approaches are instrumental in integrating expert insights into the causal discovery process. In addition to observational data, causal discovery methods have evolved to accommodate experimental data, where interventions or randomized experiments are conducted. These methods utilize the causal effects of interventions to deduce causal relationships. Expert knowledge plays a vital role here as well, contributing to the design of well-controlled experiments or interventions, drawing upon domain expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</p><p>Pressure Injuries and Spinal Cord Injury: Pressure injuries (PI), commonly known as sores or ulcers, develop rapidly on skin areas under constant pressure. This condition is particularly prevalent among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), affecting 20-50% of this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Due to altered or loss of sensory feedback, individuals with SCI often do not detect early warning signs such as pain. Without timely intervention, PIs can progress to severe stages, causing significant health deterioration in individuals with SCI and imposing a substantial burden on the healthcare system for detection and treatment. Understanding the risk factors related to the onset of PIs is essential for clinical management, enabling early prevention, detection, and proper treatment. Despite extensive research, the risk factors for PIs remain complex and not fully understood, especially for different sub-populations. Moreover, PIs are common issues in other inpatient scenarios, often linked to prolonged bedridden stays. Key factors influencing PI development include the combination of shear and friction, the duration and frequency of applied pressure, characteristics of the soft tissue, and oxygenation levels. However, individual factors play a significant role as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . These include an individual's medical history, the etiology of their SCI, muscle build, posture, nutritional status, and various behavioral factors. Additional risk factors such as age and gender also influence an individual's pressure tolerance, therefore altering their risk level.</p><p>Substantial medical data mining and statistical analyses have shed light on the relationship between PI onset and various influencing factors. Recent works exploring the risk factors for hospital-acquired PI (HAPI): PI acquired during hospital stays for acute healthcare and rehabilitation, have primarily focused on comparing mean differences between HAPI and non-HAPI groups. These studies identified risk factors significantly different between groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . However, this approach offers limited information into the detailed quantitative relationships between these factors. The lack of a model to explain the mechanism underlying HAPI onset constrains the practical usage in clinical settings. To address this gap, some studies have employed various ML models to identify risk factors and model the relationships between these factors and PI occurrence. These studies have shown competitive performance in predicting PI onset not just in the SCI population but in broader patient groups as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> . However, most of these works use traditional association-based ML methods, which often lack transparency in model design and working logic. This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in the SCI field where experts prefer interpretable and explainable models for reliable understanding and application. Moreover, traditional ML models often perform poorly in out-of-distribution settings where models trained on certain datasets are applied to new datasets collected under different conditions. Consequently, there is a growing need for a modeling framework that offers both explainability and transferability in PI management. Such a framework would assist experts in understanding mechanisms, adapting to conditions, and improving current protocols. Causal models, with their explicit mathematical formulations, have gained growing attention for their potential to provide actionable information for early intervention and prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . However, challenges remain, including dealing with mixed types of variables, missing values, and measurement errors in heterogeneous data. These challenges necessitate the development of more versatile and robust methods in causal learning and reasoning. Moreover, the value of expert knowledge becomes even more crucial when data reliability is compromised by factors such as insufficient sample size or measurement errors.</p><p>GM has been used to represent SCI body processes and functions in an organized, compact, and abstract way. GM identifies essential conditional independences and eliminates spurious relationships among variables extracted from social and medical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> . Despite claims of high problem prevalence and connectivity in each SCI functioning domain using GM, the methodologies used mainly involve undirected graphical modeling. This approach provides limited information, particularly regarding causal relationships, which are essential for a better understanding and effective utilization of the data.</p><p>Objectives: The primary goal of this work is to uncover the causal relationships that underline the onset of PI among individuals with SCI, thereby aiding decision-making for early prevention and detection. The creation of a comprehensive causal map for PI onset in the SCI population is a novel aspect of our work, addressing a significant gap in scientific exploration. However, data-driven causal discovery presents substantial challenges due to the wide discrepancy between idealistic assumptions and the complex realities of mixed data types and sub-sampling. The limited sample sizes available for recording patient conditions make it nearly impossible to ascertain all causal relationships solely from data. Our work aims to develop an interactive framework for causal discovery, capable of handling mixed-type variables and integrating expert knowledge about SCI and its complications. The focus is on enhancing current knowledge discovery by combining different information sources and developing a causal learning pipeline for various hospitals and institutions. We developed and tested our method using both simulation and clinical PI datasets, showing its superiority over existing methods. The causal representation aims to abstract the mechanisms behind PI onset in individuals with SCI, laying the foundation for a graph-based learning framework that integrates heterogeneous data sources for personalized risk identification of SCI comorbidities in the future.</p><p>Contributions: This paper presents an exploration of graphical modeling in healthcare, highlighting its applications, examples, and the transparency it offers. While significant progress has been made, effectively addressing mixed-type variables remains a challenge. This limitation restricts the widespread utilization of these models across a variety of healthcare datasets. The contributions of this study are threefold:</p><p>First, we explored the causal relationships underpinning HAPI onset and constructed a causal graph using single-center clinical data. Our approach systematically incorporates expert knowledge, such as precedence-relationship constraints, and can be extended to other types of expert beliefs. This method marks a significant advancement in integrating expert-guided learning to enhance causal discovery. While not a complete solution, it enables the imposition of constraints based on known relationships, facilitating a continuous learning process crucial in domains with ongoing data generation.</p><p>Second, we present a method for learning a causal graph with mixed-type variables and latent confounders. This approach employs a constraint-based causal discovery approach with a novel extension of conditional independence tests based on predictive permutation feature importance. Its efficacy is validated through evaluations of learning accuracy and scalability on synthetic datasets, elaborated in the Appendix.</p><p>Third, we utilized the constructed graphical representation to develop robust predictive models. These models are based on ensemble classification models with various feature spaces indicated by the graph. The workflow pipeline is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The models trained on those feature spaces showed competitive performance in predicting HAPI onset. They also met the requirement of being explainable by the graphical structure of selected features, which is crucial for early prediction and prevention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In this study, we utilized an augmented dataset for HAPI that combines data from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and newly collected cohorts. This dataset was used for statistical analysis and modeling following ethical clearance, as detailed in the Ethical Approval section. It includes records of 250 SCI patients with SCI, encompassing 21 mixed-type variables. These variables range from demographic features and lab testing values to health conditions observed during the patients' hospital stay. Key features such as "level of injury," "abnormal body temperature severity," and "Nutrition Uptake" are encoded both numerically and originally. For more information on data encoding and mapping, refer to Section 3 of the Supplementary Materials. A statistical summary of the data is available in Section 2 of the Supplementary Materials. From this summary, we identified 17 factors significantly related to HAPI onset. However, the significance tests provide limited information, as they do not clarify whether some factors are conditional independent of HAPI in the presence of other factors, nor do they detail the specific quantitative relationships of these factors with HAPI.</p><p>Causal Discovery with Mixed-Type Variables: Existing methods have approached mixed-type variables using either constraint-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> or score-based methods, but without considering latent confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . However, clinical datasets should account for latent confounders due to the inherent lack of complete observability in the causal graph. The FCI method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , a constraint-based approach, was designed to address the limitations of the traditional PC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , which does not account for latent variables. The key advantage of the FCI is its ability to detect complex causal relationships involving unobserved factors. However, the accuracy of FCI results is contingent upon the data quality and the validity of the underlying assumptions of conditional independence tests (CIT). In this study, we focused on extending the FCI method to handle mixed-type variables. We propose a predictive permutation CIT (PPCIT) based on predictive permutation feature importance (PPFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , a method that harnesses a supervised ML framework using well-developed non-parametric predictive models. Unlike traditional CITs based on likelihood ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , PPCIT integrates into the FCI approach to ease the data distribution assumptions required by other CITs. Detailed algorithmic information and validation of causal discovery using PPCIT on two synthetic datasets are discussed in Section 2 of the supplementary material. The simulation results demonstrate that PPCIT outperforms existing constrained-based methods in the MAGGIC dataset, where binary variables are predominant. Additionally, PPCIT shows superior computational efficiency than kernel-based methods, particularly with large datasets.</p><p>Expert Knowledge Embedding -Chronological Information: While observational data alone can uncover certain plausible relationships, there are instances where the learned connections defy common sense or reality. The chronological order of variables during data collection, organized with the assistance of domain experts, is crucial. Based on the nature of time, we divided all variables into four groups, represented as square blocks in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In this setup, only the edges that align with the temporal flow are permitted while learning the graph. Edges that contradict the sequential order are excluded, preventing them from forming baseless relations between variable groups. This time-based embedding guides the causal discovery, helping to avoid irrational relationships arising from insufficient samples or measurement errors. The influence of expert knowledge embedding on the graphical identification of risk factors is visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Notably, incorporating temporal information helps rectify erroneous edges, such as the causal direction from "HAPI" to "AIS." More importantly, these corrections can induce new conditional independence relationships and adjust previously learned edges, resulting in a more reasonable overall graph structure.</p><p>Graphical Model and Risk Factors: GM learned from observational data with expert knowledge embedding, can be used to identify essential risk factors for the onset of HAPI. With a graphical representation, we gain insights not only into associations but also causal relationships. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> demonstrates the partial ancestral graph (PAG), the Markov equivalence class (MEC) of ancestral graphs that share the same conditional independence relationships, as learned from the cohort data. For a detailed introduction to PAG and other graph types, please see Section 1 of the Appendix. This graph is the output of applying FCI algorithm, enhanced by integrating expert knowledge. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, we present a summary of the risk factors identified by the extended Markov blanket of the target variable "HAPI" in the final PAG, post the integration of temporal information. Compared to other feature selection approaches and previous studies, the risk factors identified using PAG are notably more informative. They imply causal relationships that are crucial for further prediction and reasoning. Moreover, the graph's double-arrow edges, representing the existence of latent confounders -hidden common causes affecting both variables connected by these, offer heuristic guidance for experts to explore potentially more significant risk factors.</p><p>Predicting HAPI Onset Using PAG: In predicting the onset of HAPI, we utilized the complete feature space indicated by the PAG, as detailed in the method pipeline shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The specifics of data splitting and candidate ML models  are discussed in the Methods section. We evaluated the predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with results displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, and balanced accuracy, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. According to these results, ML models trained on features selected from the PAG achieved comparable or even slightly better performance in predicting HAPI onset compared to models using risk factors identified in previous studies and other feature selection methods.</p><p>The benefit of embedding temporal information was further testified by an AUC score of 0.983 and balanced prediction accuracy of 0.925, compared to the baseline RFE method, which scored an AUC of 0.983 and a balanced prediction accuracy of 0.921.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal and Early Prediction of HAPI Onset:</head><p>It is important to recognize that while using all crucial factors associated with HAPI can lead to accurate predictions, this approach has significant practical limitations. Some variables, such as "Length of Stay," are not observable until after the event (in this case, the completion of the hospital stay), rendering them impractical for early prediction. Therefore, a more focused selection of factors, according to causal relationships and chronological information, is necessary to enable causal or early prediction, which is essential for the early prevention and treatment of HAPI. In Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, we present the prediction results using causal and early features. Causal features are defined as the ancestors of the "HAPI" node in the PAG, while early features refer to the Markov Blanket of "HAPI," identified according to the principles of D-separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , after setting the node "Length of Stay" as unobserved. The results show that these features not only achieve comparable prediction performance but also offer significant advantages for early prediction. Moreover, these features, along with the identified latent confounders, provide valuable insights into which factors should be monitored and addressed from the onset of hospital admission to prevent HAPI effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significant Risk Factors for HAPI:</head><p>We encoded the level of injury, ranging from tetraplegic (C1-C8) to paraplegic (T1-T12, L1-L5, S1-S5), using numbers 1 to 30 to represent levels from C1 to S5. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> highlights that the level of injury is a   <ref type="table">4</ref> in the Supplementary Materials further indicates that individuals with SCI at lower injury levels are more prone to developing HAPI.</p><p>In the final PAG learned, "Pneumonia" and "Vitamin D," despite being identified as risk factors for HAPI in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> or by other feature selection methods, are deemed redundant in the context of our graph. This redundancy does not imply a lack of correlation with HAPI onset. These factors remain relevant, as there are connected paths from these nodes to the target node "HAPI" in the final PAG. However, they become redundant when certain nodes on these paths are observed or blocked, following the D-separation terminology.  "Nutrition Uptake" is recognized as a significant risk factor for HAPI onset by our graph. This finding coincides with existing knowledge that nutritional deprivation and insufficient dietary intake are critical factors in the development of PI and impaired wound healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Furthermore, our analysis identifies albumin level as causally related to HAPI onset, a finding supported by research <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> conducted on intensive care unit patients, extending beyond the SCI population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local Causal Discovery for PI Locations</head><p>The causal diagram in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> provides a broad view, with the binary node "HAPI" representing whether an individual has developed HAPI during their stay. While this high-level view offers guidance for individuals with SCI and medical workers in prioritizing preventive procedures, it lacks specifically for inspecting causal relations and risk factors related to HAPI occurrence in various susceptible body locations. Due to insufficient data points, we show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> tentative causal graph, calibrated with time constraints, for different HAPI locations. Most causal relations in this more detailed graph align with those in the original broader graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. "Nutrition Uptake" remains a universally important risk factor for HAPI across several locations. The newly discovered causal relationships between HAPI locations and risk factors are interesting and offer valuable insights but require further validation to confirm their reliability and applicability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We present the framework that employs GM to explore causal relationships behind HAPI in individuals with SCI using data from a single medical center. Our approach involves a constraint-based causal discovery approach, enhanced with a novel conditional independence test based on predictive permutation feature importance. This technique has shown competitive performance in learning accuracy and scalability. Detailed information about the algorithm and its validation on synthetic datasets is discussed in Supplementary Materials. Moreover, our framework systematically incorporates expert knowledge, such as chronological information, into the causal discovery process using a block graph. This method of embedding expert knowledge can also be adapted to include other types of expertise, organizing variables and relationships in a specific manner. Features N, K., et al 20 S, A., et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref>  . PAG refers to features selected according to PAG learned; "r"-all relevant features on raw graph; "m"-all relevant features on final graph after embedding expert knowledge; "c"-causal features on final graph after embedding expert knowledge; "e"-early features on final graph after embedding expert knowledge.</p><p>Compared to other approaches and previous studies in identifying risk factors, our GM-based approach, enriched with expert knowledge, yields more informative, explainable, and accurate feature spaces for predictive modeling and early intervention.</p><p>Limitations and Future Work The data were collected from a single hospital, so care must be taken when applying or interpreting these findings to different institutions and countries. The GM learned from this data should be tested in other medical centers specializing in SCI to validate its causal relationships. Methodologically, while we embed the PPCIT into classic constraint-based causal discovery methods for mixed-type data, an alternative approach could involve transforming mixed-type variables into continuous ones using a Gaussian Copula 37 , followed by applying ordinary causal discovery methods for continuous variables. Furthermore, The FCI algorithm with PPCIT faces challenges in high-dimensional settings, highlighting the need for more scalable causal discovery algorithms for mixed-type variables with latent confounders. Moreover, the predictive results on HAPI alone may not suffice as definitive proof of effective causal graph learning. Controlled intervention experiments are necessary to evaluate and validate the causal inference using the learned causal graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , especially in the absence of ground truth.</p><p>A critical aspect yet to be fully explored is the uncertainty of expert knowledge. In medical applications, reliance on expert knowledge in causal discovery must be approached with caution, as incorrect expert input can lead to significant errors in prediction and causal inference. An approach that accounts for expert uncertainty is more robust to potential biases. Therefore, we advocate for an iterative causal discovery framework with continual expert interaction and calibration, enhancing the robustness of the learning process. A tentative pipeline of this is proposed in the last section of Supplementary Materials.</p><p>We anticipate the exciting development of a multi-modal graphical modeling framework that facilitates comprehensive risk assessment for SCI comorbidities. This framework will extend beyond PI to include other complications, such as autonomic dysreflexia and cardiovascular diseases. Incorporating more detailed data, such as biometrics extracted from wearable sensors, will enable us to capture the bodily dynamics and interactions of individuals with SCI in more precisely. This refined data collection will be instrumental in enhancing personalized monitoring and decision-making for patients with SCI. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The overarching approach of this study involved using GM to distill the interactions among various variables measured from individuals with SCI, to identify predictive signals for the onset of HAPI. Within this framework, the graph nodes represent variables extracted from the body conditions, such as abnormal body temperature (categorical variables), background variables such as the level of injury, and event variables including the occurrence of pneumonia. Each node is treated as random and assumed to be conditionally dependent on its parent node(s). Given the constraints of limited sample size and the vast discrepancies between theoretical assumptions and realistic complexities, fully learning all causal relationships solely from observational data is impossible. While many methods for causal discovery using GM have been developed, they often result in an equivalence class of graphs that encode the same conditional Independence present in the data. Asserting causal relationships must be handled with caution as controlled experiments remain the gold standard for establishing causality. Therefore, causal discovery has long been a subject of study and improvement, especially regarding its feasibility for different data distributions, but its real-world applications have been somewhat limited. In this paper, we propose a method of systematically constraining the data-driven causal discovery with supplementary expert knowledge. Our focus is to improve current knowledge discovery and representation using well-defined cohort data and to develop a continual causal learning and inference pipeline applicable in various hospital or institutional settings dealing with different diseases.</p><p>Data Imputation and Splitting: We employed MissForest 39 , an effective approach for multivariate data imputation, to impute missing values in our dataset. Post-imputation, categorical values were rounded off. We then divided the imputed dataset (250 records) into a training set (200 records) and a test set (50 records), ensuring a stratified split with respect to HAPI onset. This stratification maintained consistent ratios of HAPI onset in both subsets.</p><p>Markov Blanket with Latent Confounders: After the causal discovery process, we use the Markov blanket (MB) of the target variable "HAPI" as the feature space for training our predictive model. The concept of MB in DAG has been extended to accommodate ancestral graphs according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref>   We tested various classification models on the selected feature space for predicting the risk of developing HAPI. Our candidate models included logistic regression, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptrons, KNN (K-nearest neighbors) classifiers, and tree-based classification methods. We conducted cross-validation within the training dataset to choose the most suitable model for classifying HAPI onset. The best candidate was then evaluated for its predictive performance on the test dataset.</p><p>Causal Inference of Intervenable Risk Factors: Based on the constructed graph, we can estimate the causal effects of intervening causal factors on HAPI risk by extending the framework of LV-IDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . These results can support interventions at causal nodes such as SCIM and Albumin, aiding in the design of rehabilitation programs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
