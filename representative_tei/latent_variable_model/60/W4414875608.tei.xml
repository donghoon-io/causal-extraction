<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Causal inference relies on the untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding on causal estimates. Among sensitivity analysis methods proposed in the literature for unmeasured confounding, the latent confounder approach is favoured for its intuitive interpretation via the use of bias parameters to specify the relationship between the observed and unobserved variables and the sensitivity function approach directly characterizes the net causal effect of the unmeasured confounding without explicitly introducing latent variables to the causal models. In this paper, we developed and extended two sensitivity analysis approaches, namely the Bayesian sensitivity analysis with latent confounding variables and the Bayesian sensitivity function approach for the estimation of time-varying treatment effects with longitudinal observational data subjected to time-varying unmeasured confounding. We investigated the performance of these methods in a series of simulation studies and applied them to a multi-center pediatric disease registry data to provide practical guidance on their implementation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Observational studies provide a feasible, efficient, and cost-effective design for gathering evidence to study treatment and exposure effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref> These data present inherent complexities for comparative effectiveness research, such as time-varying treatment-confounding feedback, where the confounders change over time and are influenced by past treatment. Administrative databases are a common source of observational data. Although administrative data are rich in information that spans diagnostic codes, health service billing codes, prescription records, and other information collected at each health services encounter, key variables such as detailed clinical biomarkers and sociodemographic variables (e.g., education level and household income) are not always captured. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Blair et al., 2021)</ref> These variables are often considered unmeasured confounding variables in the causal conceptual framework. For causal estimation, unmeasured confounding violates the strongly ignorable treatment assignment assumption and can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rubin, 1980)</ref> Sensitivity analysis can be applied to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding on the causal estimation, and has been advocated by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for the purpose of examining the influence of potential unmeasured confounding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Von Elm, 2007)</ref> Unmeasured confounding is typically captured through one or more non-identifiable numerical parameters, commonly termed bias parameters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Greenland, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brumback et al., 2004)</ref> One proceeds by specifying and formulating the bias parameters with a plausible range of values and derives the bias-corrected causal estimand using these bias parameters. There are two streams of sensitivity analysis approaches that have been proposed under this framework, namely the latent variable approach and the sensitivity function approach (also known as the confounding function approach).</p><p>The latent variable approach introduces the unmeasured confounding as a single latent/unmeasured variable in the causal framework. Rosenbaum and Rubin first proposed this approach to examine how sensitive the conclusions of a study with a binary outcome are to a binary unmeasured confounder. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983</ref>) Several sensitivity methods have been developed under the latent variable approach for cross-sectional data, including parametric, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Phillips, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Steenland and Greenland, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McCandless et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McCandless and Gustafson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McCandless and Somers, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rose et al., 2023)</ref> non-parametric, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Franks et al., 2020)</ref> and semi-parametric. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zhang and Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dorie et al., 2016)</ref> Many approaches with the latent confounding variables fall under probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which posit probability distributions for the bias parameters and average over the distributions to obtain bias-adjusted estimates, and can be estimated under full Bayesian inference or Monte Carlo estimation. The latent variable approach is favoured when external knowledge or external data is available to inform the distribution of the unmeasured confounding and the strength of association between the unmeasured confounding and the measured variables.</p><p>The sensitivity function approach is framed based on the exchangeability assumption, it uses the sensitivity function to characterize the net causal effect influenced by the unmeasured confounding. The sensitivity function is viewed as the bias parameter and used to derive bias-corrected estimations of the average potential outcome to quantify the influence of unmeasured confounding on the average treatment effect. Existing methods for the sensitivity function approach include parametric, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brumback et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shardell and Ferrucci, 2018)</ref> and semi-parametric. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cheng et al., 2024)</ref> The sensitivity function approach is preferred when there is insufficient knowledge about the unmeasured confounding and when the primary interest is in understanding the residual confounding in causal estimation without explicitly introducing the unmeasured confounding as random variables in causal modelling.</p><p>These two streams of sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding have been studied rigorously in the point treatment setting. Extensions to longitudinal causal data with time-varying treatment and time-varying unmeasured confounding are very limited and predominantly frequentist. In this paper, we proposed two Bayesian sensitivity analyses, one parametric method utilizing Bayesian g-computation based on the latent confounding variable approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Keil et al., 2018)</ref> and one semi-parametric method utilizing Bayesian marginal structural models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Saarela et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al., 2020)</ref> following the sensitivity function approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brumback et al., 2004)</ref> Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the setup and notation. In Section 3, we provide an overview of our proposed sensitivity analysis procedure. In Section 4, we examine the performance of our proposed method using a simulation study. Section 5 demonstrates applying the proposed procedure to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) registry data. A discussion of the proposed methods is provided in Section 6.</p></div>

In this paper, we set the unmeasured confounders at each visit to be binary, which denotes the presence or absence of unmeasured confounding in the observed data. In practice, one can treat U as a continuous, time-varying variable and proceed with the same estimation steps outlined above.</p></div>

Several causal estimation approaches for time-varying treatment and confounding can be applied to estimate causal effect given the bias-corrected Y SF , including the marginal structural models (MSM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brumback et al., 2004)</ref> and the Bayesian marginal structural models (BMSM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Saarela et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al., 2020)</ref> In this study, we implemented BMSMs to provide a Bayesian estimation extension to the sensitivity function approach.</p><p>The sensitivity function approach relies on the specification of the unidentifiable sensitivity function. Methodologies exist for devising functional forms of the sensitivity function. Interpretation of the sensitivity function for the point-treatment setting with cross-sectional data can be found in Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu et al., 2022)</ref>. We can consider the following strategies for specifying the sensitivity function c(•):</p><p>1.

The c(•) can be expressed as a scalar parameter α or as a function of the measured covariates and treatment.</p><p>2. For a binary outcome, c(•) denotes the expected difference between two probabilities on the outcome, with a natural bound of [-1, 1]; For a continuous outcome, c(•) denotes the difference between two expected potential outcome functions. This is naturally bounded by the differences between the minimum and the maximum value of the outcome.</p><p>3. c(•) can also be specified to represent the residual confounding from the conditional outcome model that is not explained by measured covariates and treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hogan et al., 2014)</ref> In Hu et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu et al., 2022)</ref> an estimated R 2 from the conditional outcome model was used to capture residual confounding for a binary outcome.</p></div>

For the Bayesian latent variable approach, we assigned bias parameters except for σ U with prior of Uniform (-2, 2), which implied odds ratio for the association between U and other covariates that range from exp(-2) = 0.14 to exp(2) = 7.39. For σ U , we wanted to provide a wider range for the intercept, with a prior Uniform (-5, 5). For the sensitivity function approach, the true, simulated visit-specific sensitivity function was calculated for each subject following Equation (8). We expected the sensitivity function approach to perform well, given that its true values were used in the simulation study.</p><p>In practice, we can not identify the true sensitivity function given the observed data and practical guidance on how to specify the sensitivity function in an application is explained in Section 3.2 and Section 5's data analysis.</p><p>To facilitate the implementation of these methods, we provided R code to replicate our simulation studies on GitHub, <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/reidbrok/SensitivityAnalysis_TimeVarying">https://github.com/reidbrok/SensitivityAnalysis_TimeVarying</ref>. For all simulation scenarios, the causal parameter of interest was the causal contrast in the outcome between "always treated" and "never treated", denoted as E(Y (1)) -E(Y (0)). We considered each simulation setting with ns = 1000 replications and reported the estimated mean (posterior mean for BSA) of the causal effect as In scenarios involving time-varying unmeasured confounding as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, the BSA time-varying U and the two sensitivity function approaches demonstrated good performance and returned approximately unbiased causal estimators. The sensitivity function approach returned a smaller standard error as expected, where the sensitivity parameters (i.e., the visit-specific sensitivity functions) are plugged in with the true simulated values of the sensitivity function, compared to the BSA time-varying U approach where we used a set of relatively vague uniform priors for the sensitvity parameters. Notably, the performance of these two approaches did not suffer when there were two unmeasured time-varying confounders. The BSA time-invariant U performed well in settings with a single binary or a single continuous unmeasured time-varying confounder.

The current analysis was restricted to subjects who had complete measurements of GGT, AST, and platelet levels at the time of diagnosis and two years post-diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing PSC onset dates and those who had received OVT before their PSC diagnosis. However, patients who underwent liver transplantation during the follow-up period were still considered for inclusion in the study. The primary outcome for the current analysis was a natural logarithm-transformed GGT at 2 years after diagnosis. Patients were defined as being exposed to OVT at each follow-up visit if they received OVT during the preceding year, based on recorded start and stop dates. There were three OVT groups: OVT-free over 2 years (OV T = 00), OVT-free between 0 to 1 year and OVT exposed between 1 to 2 years (OV T = 01), and OVT exposed between 0 to 1 year and remained on OVT between 1 to 2 years (OV T = 11). No patients who started on OVT between 0 to 1 year stopped OVT before 2 years. We defined the cumulative treatment of OVT as the total number of follow-up intervals where patients were exposed to OVT, taking on values 0, 1, and 2. Baseline variables included age at PSC diagnosis, sex, PSC disease phenotype (large versus small duct involvement), concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) overlap, Metavir fibrosis stage, hepatobiliary events and baseline GGT measure.</p><p>Concurrent IBD at PSC diagnosis, at one year, and two years was defined based on whether the patient had been diagnosed with IBD before the PSC diagnosis, within one year after the PSC diagnosis, and two years after the PSC diagnosis, respectively.

Vague uniform priors ranging from -10 to 10 were used for all bias parameters, and normal priors with zero means were assigned for other non-bias parameters and the precision was 0.01 and 0.001 for coefficients and intercepts, respectively. We saved 15,000 MCMC draws using 25,000 burn-in iterations and 25,000 further iterations with every fifth sample being gathered.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we introduced two Bayesian approaches for causal sensitivity analysis in the presence of unmeasured time-varying confounding: the Bayesian latent variable approach and the Bayesian sensitivity function approach.</p><p>The latent variable approach models time-varying unmeasured confounding as hidden variables within the causal model, enabling the integration of external data or prior knowledge and offering greater conceptual and interpretative clarity in applied settings. In contrast, the sensitivity function approach directly characterizes the net bias induced by unmeasured time-varying confounding without explicitly modelling latent variables, thereby avoiding distributional assumptions; however, this approach may be less interpretable in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to formalize the derivation of both approaches and to provide a comprehensive comparison through simulation.</p><p>The Bayesian latent variable approach incorporates treatment, outcome, and covariate model-specific bias parameters to quantify the relationship between unobserved and observed confounders. This is in line with other probabilistic sensitivity analysis methods that leverage prior knowledge of the bias parameters to conceptualize the impact of time-varying unmeasured confounding, which naturally captures estimation uncertainty. The proposed Bayesian latent variable approach can be easily implemented in R statistical software and off-the-self MCMC software such as JAGS and STAN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Plummer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carpenter et al., 2017)</ref> The Bayesian sensitivity function approach with Bayesian marginal structural models has a natural connection to the frequentist sensitivity function approach with frequentist marginal structural models. Bayesian causal estimation under this method can be performed semi-parametrically or non-parametrically, following maximization of the weighted utility function via Bayesian non-parametric bootstrap. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Saarela et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stephens et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Luo et al., 2025)</ref> Our simulation study reveals that the proposed Bayesian latent variable approach with a time-varying latent confounder offers a practical strategy for addressing unmeasured confounding in longitudinal settings and can be extremely useful when there is historical or external data on the unmeasured confounding. While the sensitivity function methods can yield more efficient and unbiased estimates, they rely on the correct specification of the sensitivity function and are difficult to interpret and explain clinically. We recommend in practice to conduct both the Bayesian latent variable approach and the Bayesian sensitivity function approach, and to discuss the sensitivity analysis results with clinical collaborators to ensure sound and interpretable conclusions. Caution is warranted in settings where the unmeasured confounding structure is complex, such as when multiple confounders with differing temporal patterns are present. In such cases, the latent variable formulation underlying the BSA approach may be misspecified, potentially limiting its validity, as reflected in our simulation results, where the Bayesian latent variable approach with a time-invariant latent variable performs poorly when the simulated causal data contains two time-varying unmeasured confounders.</p><p>The Bayesian latent variable approach relied on the correct parametric model specification of the treatment, outcome, measured and unmeasured confounding variables, while the Bayesian sensitivity function approach relied on the correct "guess" of the sensitivity function. Our simulation study did not consider scenarios of a mis-specificed conditional outcome model (e.g., the true outcome model features non-linear terms where the outcome model in BSA is specified linearly) and scenarios where there is a skewed time-varying unmeasured confounder in the simulated data. These more complicated causal structures can occur in data applications.</p><p>Future work will explore this limitation by extending these two Bayesian causal sensitivity approaches with flexible estimation algorithms, such as Bayesian additive regression tree. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu et al., 2022)</ref> While this study focuses on a binary treatment and a continuous or binary end-of-study outcome, future research will explore more complex longitudinal causal structures. These include scenarios with repeatedly measured outcomes, multiple treatments, and time-to-event outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, this study presents a Bayesian sensitivity analysis framework that effectively incorporates uncertainty surrounding bias parameters to provide bias-corrected causal effect estimates. Our work contributes to the broader goal of improving the reliability and validity of observational studies in clinical and epidemiological research. Future research will build on these foundations, extending the methodology to more complex longitudinal causal structures.</p><p>1</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">u iJ =0 P (U ij | U ij-1 , A ij-1 , X ij , τ )f (τ )dτ × n i=1 1 ui1=0 . . . 1 u iJ =0 P (X ij | X ij-1 , A ij-1 , U ij-1 , γ)f (γ) γ J j=1 n i=1 1 ui1=0 . . . 1 u iJ =0 P (X ij | X ij-1 , A ij-1 , U ij-1 , γ)f (γ)dγ = f (β | O)f (α | O)f (γ | O)f (τ | O)<label>(14)</label></formula></div>
