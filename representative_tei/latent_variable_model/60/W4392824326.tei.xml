<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Spatial data are often derived from multiple sources (e.g. satellites, in-situ sensors, survey samples) with different supports, but associated with the same properties of a spatial phenomenon of interest. It is common for predictors to also be measured on different spatial supports than the variables making up the response. Although there is no standard way to work with spatial data with different supports, a prevalent approach used by practitioners has been to use downscaling or interpolation to project all the variables of analysis towards a common support, and then using standard spatial models on this common support. The main disadvantage with this approach is that simple interpolation can introduce biases and, more importantly, the uncertainty associated with the change of support is not taken into account in the parameter estimation of the main model of interest. In this article, we propose a Bayesian spatial latent Gaussian model that can handle data with different rectilinear supports in the response variable and the predictors. Our approach allows us to handle changes of support more naturally according to the properties of the spatial stochastic process being used, and to take into account the uncertainty from the change of support in parameter estimation and prediction. We use spatial stochastic processes as linear combinations of basis functions where Gaussian Markov random fields define the weights. This process can be projected to different supports whilst maintaining the same parameters. Our hierarchical modelling approach can be described by the following steps: (i) define a latent model where response variables and predictors are considered as latent stochastic processes with continuous support, (ii) link the continuous-index set stochastic processes with its projection to the support of the observed data, (iii) link the projected process with the observed data. We show the applicability of our approach by simulation studies and modelling the land suitability of improved grassland in Rhondda Cynon Taf, a county borough in Wales.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Many research questions in environmental science and public health necessitate the utilisation of heterogeneous spatial data encompassing different supports. The characteristics of the support, commonly referred to as spatial sampling units, can vary significantly across data sources, including variations in size, shape, spacing, and extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dungan et al., 2002)</ref>. In disease incidence and prevalence modelling, it is common to obtain case data at multiple levels of aggregation, such as at the individual level, census areas, counties, and districts, along with predictors observed at both individual and aggregated levels, including satellite pixels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alegana et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee and Anderson, 2022)</ref>. In environmental modelling, there is also a frequent need to combine information from data sources with different supports across both the response and predictor variables, with a particular emphasis on the use of satellite products and synthetic data derived from climate models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pacifici et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ma and Kang, 2020)</ref>. Integrating different data sources to address a research question offers the potential to enhance parameter estimation and improve prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pacifici et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Law et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Leopold et al., 2006)</ref>. However, to achieve reliable results, it is crucial to employ a data fusion framework that appropriately acknowledges the support of the data and incorporates reasonable assumptions to mitigate biases and accurately quantify uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gotway and Young, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pacifici et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The process of projecting observed data to a common support, known as change of support (COS) in spatial statistics, is essential when integrating heterogeneous data with different supports. This encompasses two key situations: the change of support problem (COSP), where the response variable is observed at different supports, and spatial misalignment, where the support of predictors and responses differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gelfand et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gotway and Young, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhu et al., 2003)</ref>. Both scenarios require addressing the challenge of effectively utilising the information from different sources and aligning the data appropriately. In this paper, we adopt the term change of support to encompass both situations, highlighting the importance of expressing the projection of spatial data to a specific support within a unified framework for data integration and handling spatial misalignment.</p><p>Numerous attempts have been made to address the change of support problem in order to integrate multiple spatial data sources. The first set of approaches focuses on geostatistical methods, including point-to-point, block-to-block, point-to-block, and block-to-point Kriging <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kyriakidis, 2004)</ref>. These methods involve computing the covariance matrix using Monte Carlo integration and parameter estimation through variogram fitting. When dealing with spatial misalignment, predictors are projected to the response support using one of the types of Kriging and incorporated into regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Young et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The second set of approaches utilises Gaussian processes, a widely applied tool in spatial statistics, to tackle the change of support problem. Several strategies exist within this framework. One common approach is similar to Kriging, where the covariance matrix is computed using Monte Carlo integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gelfand et al., 2001)</ref>. Inference under the Gaussian process framework typically involves optimising the likelihood function or utilising Bayesian inference. Another strategy involves incorporating spatial point-level auxiliary variables, approximating the integral of the Gaussian process over a region by averaging the spatial auxiliary variables within that region <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cowles et al., 2009)</ref>. The objective here is to obtain the posterior distribution of these auxiliary variables. Additionally, a multivariate approach can be employed, treating all variables as responses and defining a full covariance matrix between sources. This approach leverages separable covariances to reduce computational costs and approximates the covariance structure on aggregated supports using Monte Carlo integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Finley et al., 2014)</ref>. Predictions can be made for all responses or specific ones. An alternative spectral approach, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Reich et al. (2014)</ref>, utilises the spectral representation of a Gaussian process. The model at aggregated support resembles a linear model with pseudo-predictors derived from spectral analysis. Finally, a computationally efficient approach involves utilising stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) to approximate the aggregated Gaussian process <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moraga et al., 2017)</ref>. The representation of the aggregated GP using SPDE has a similar structure as the continuous GP with a custom linear transformation. With this approximation, the methods for spatial inference and prediction using SPDE can be applied.</p><p>The third set assumes that data arise from processes that are piecewise constant on a predefined grid. This allows for analytical simplification, where integrals become linear combinations of areas. The projection of piecewise processes to other supports is computed as weighted averages of the latent process values at cells intersecting the area of interest. These approaches often utilise grids based on the highest observed resolution or custom computational grids. The main objective is to obtain the posterior distribution of the piecewise constant process <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Taylor et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Taylor et al., , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bradley et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Although various approaches have been developed to address the change of support problem using Kriging, Gaussian processes, and piecewise processes, they are not without limitations. Many of these approaches rely on approximating covariance matrices on aggregated supports using Monte Carlo integration or by averaging spatial random variables. However, the accuracy of these approximations depends on the number of points used and the sampling algorithms employed, and the discussion of approximation errors is often neglected. Moreover, these approximations are necessary even in simpler domains like regular and rectilinear grids. Another limitation is the lack of a precise connection between the continuous and aggregated spatial processes in some approaches. Lastly, most existing approaches are tailored to specific types of models, which restricts their flexibility in handling more complex modelling scenarios within a unified framework.</p><p>In this article, we propose a Bayesian latent Gaussian spatial model that addresses the challenge of handling data with different supports in the response variable and predictors. Our approach offers a more natural and flexible way to handle the change of support problem, taking into account the properties of the underlying spatial stochastic process. We incorporate the uncertainty associated with the change of support into parameter estimation and prediction. Our proposed model utilises a spatial stochastic process expressed as a linear combination of basis functions, where the weights are determined by Gaussian Markov random fields. Notably, this process allows for accurate projection onto rectilinear supports while preserving the same set of parameters. The hierarchical nature of our model involves the following steps: (i) defining a latent model using latent stochastic processes with continuous support that are related to the response variables and predictors, (ii) establishing the connection between the continuous-index set stochastic processes and their projection onto the support of the observed data, and (iii) linking the observed data as noisy realisations of the projected processes. We demonstrate the practical application of our approach in mod-elling the land suitability of improved grassland in Rhondda Cynon Taf, a county borough in Wales. Our prediction of land suitability relies on various predictors, including elevation, growing degree days, and soil moisture surplus. Notably, these predictors are available at different resolutions than the land cover data (25m).</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce spatial latent Gaussian models as a comprehensive framework encompassing common models used in spatial statistics. Section 3 builds upon this foundation and extends the discussion to the properties of these processes when projected onto aggregated supports. We present our proposed Bayesian latent Gaussian spatial model with change of support in this section. To demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of our approach, we conduct simulation studies in Section 4. In Section 5, we model the land suitability of improved grassland in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss the contributions, advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and potential future directions of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Spatial latent Gaussian models</head><p>Spatial latent Gaussian models (SLGM) encompass commonly used models for analysing spatial point-level and area-level data. They can be tailored to specific classical generalised spatial models depending on the latent stochastic process used to capture spatial variation. We define a SLGM in Section 2.1 and discuss the limitations concerning their ability to handle spatial data with different levels of support in Section 2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Definition</head><p>A classical SLGM assumes that the conditional distribution F(•) of a random function Y (l), for a location l ∈ D ⊂ R 2 , given a p-dimensional set of covariates x(l) = [x 1 (l), . . . , x p (l)] ⊺ and the Gaussian random function W (l), can be defined as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y (l) | x(l), W (l) ∼ F(θ(l), τ 2 ), g(θ(l)) = η(l) = β 0 + x ⊺ (l)β + W (l),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where g(•) is the link function between the conditional mean θ(l) and the linear predictor η(l), and τ 2 is an additional parameter. As usual, β 0 and β are the intercept and covariate effects, respectively. For a set of locations L = {s 1 , . . . , s n }, which can be points, lines or regions, this implies that the elements of a set of random variables {Y (s i ) : i = 1, 2, . . . , n} are conditionally independent given the covariates {x(s i )} and the spatial stochastic process {W (l) : l ∈ D}. This model assumes that the random vector W l = [W (l 1 ), . . . , W (l n )] follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution.</p><p>The model defined by the Equation (1) encompasses various classical spatial models based on the specific type of l (point or regions) and the properties of the spatial stochastic process {W (l)}. There are three main cases: i) In the classical generalised geostatistical model, l represents a point, and {W (l)} is defined as a Gaussian process with zero-mean and covariance function κ(l, l * )). ii) In the generalised conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial model, l represents a region and {W (l)} is defined as a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) with zero-mean and precision matrix Q. iii) In the geoadditive model, l represents a point, and {W (l)} is defined using basis functions. Details of common stochastic processes can be found in Section B.1 of the Supplementary Material (SM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Limitations</head><p>Although the framework defined by Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is attractive and encompasses different types of spatial models, it has certain requirements. Firstly, it assumes that responses are observed at the same type of support, such as either point-level or aggregated-level data. Secondly, both responses and predictors need to be available at the same sampling units to make inferences. Lastly, predictors should be available for any location within the area of interest (s ∈ D) to enable spatial prediction at unobserved locations. However, these assumptions are often challenging to satisfy in real-world applications and are closely tied to the concept of change of support discussed earlier.</p><p>In practice, it is common for practitioners to perform pre-processing steps when using the models defined in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>. This is because the three assumptions mentioned earlier are often not met, and existing approaches for dealing with change of support are often inflexible. These approaches typically involve approximating covariance matrices on aggregated supports using Monte Carlo integration or by averaging spatial random variables. A common practice is to interpolate the spatial data to a consistent support, which enables the application of models like (1). However, it can introduce biases in mean predictions and also affect the accuracy of uncertainty quantification.</p><p>Our research on this topic proposes models for continuous spatial variation able to (i) include data at different support types for the response variable, (ii) include predictors observed at different spatial sampling units, (iii) perform spatial prediction of the response variable Y (s) even in cases where the covariates x(s) are not available for all s ∈ D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Spatial latent Gaussian model with change of support</head><p>We present a hierarchical SLGM that addresses the challenge of handling spatial data with different supports in the response variable and predictors. We introduce the concept of change of support in spatial stochastic processes and discuss the properties of Gaussian processes (GPs) and linear combinations of basis functions when the support is altered (Section 3.1). Subsequently, in Section 3.2, we propose a hierarchical SLGM that effectively handles the change of support by utilising latent spatial processes. Bayesian inference and spatial prediction of our approach are explained in sections C.2 and C.3 of the SM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Change of Support on Stochastic Processes</head><p>Let {W (s) : s ∈ D} represent a spatial stochastic process with a continuous index set D and continuous state space R. When the support is changed, the process is defined over a different index set, resulting in another process {W (c) : c ⊂ D}, where c represents any geometry included in D. Specifically, we focus on the case where c represents a region, and W (c) is defined as a integral over that region:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W (c) = c W (s)h(s)ds.</formula><p>(2)</p><p>In this equation, the function h(s) serves as a weighting function that determines the importance of each location s within the region c. In practical applications, this function can take into account factors such as the sampling effort at a specific location. Alternatively, h(s) can be defined as |c| -1 to obtain an average over c, or as 1 for a total.</p><p>To effectively integrate datasets with different spatial supports through the change of support, it is necessary to use stochastic processes {W (s)} that allow for efficient and accurate computation of Equation (2). Specifically, when considering a set of points S = {s i : i = 1, . . . , n s } and regions C = {c i : i = 1, . . . , n c }, we need the capability to obtain the joint density of the associated random vectors W s = [W (s 1 ), W (s 2 ), . . . , W (s m )] ⊤ and W c = [W (c 1 ), W (c 2 ), . . . , W (c m )] ⊤ . Furthermore, we should be able to establish the connection or association between these random vectors W s and W c . In the following section, we discuss the properties with respect to the change of support for Gaussian processes and linear combinations of basis functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaussian Processes</head><p>The main property for a GP(µ(s), κ(s, s * )) is that the random vector W s for any finite set of points S = {s i : i = 1, . . . , n s } follows a multivariate normal distribution with vector mean µ s = [µ(s 1 ), . . . , µ(s ns )] and covariance matrix Σ s with elements (Σ s ) ij = κ(s i , s j ). When the support is changed, as presented in Equation (2), the random vector W c for any finite set of regions C = {c i : i = 1, . . . , n c } follows also a multivariate normal distribution with mean µ c = [ c 1 µ(s)ds, . . . , cn µ(s)ds] and covariance matrix Σ c <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gelfand et al., 2001)</ref>. The elements of the covariance matrix are defined by (Σ</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c ) ij = 1 |c i ||c j | s∈c i s * ∈c j κ(s -s * )dsds * , where |•| is the area operator.</formula><p>More generally, considering the set of points and regions A = {s 1 , . . . , s ns , c 1 , . . . , c nc }, the associated random vector W a also follows a multivariate normal distribution with</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">µ a = [µ ⊺ s , µ ⊺ c ] and covariance matrix Σ a = Σ s Σ sc Σ ⊺ sc Σ c</formula><p>, where (Σ sc ) ij = 1 |c j | s∈c j κ(s i -s)ds. Hence, it is possible to derive the joint density function for any set of points and/or regions, which can be utilised for statistical inference and spatial prediction. However, both depends of the elements of the covariate matrix, which are commonly approximated using Monte Carlo integration (see Section C.1.1 of the SM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linear Combinations of Spatial Basis Functions</head><p>The evaluation of the linear combination of spatial basis functions over any n-dimensional set of points S can be expressed as W s = B s δ where δ is a n-dimensional GMRF and the row i of B s is the evaluation of the basis function at point s i . Under a change of support, the continuous process is projected to</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">W (c) = q 1 j=1 q 2 l=1 δ jl s∈c b jl (s)ds = b ⊺ (c)δ, (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where δ is the q-dimensional GMRF and b(c) is a vector containing the integral of the twodimensional basis functions b jl (•) over c. Hence, any random vector associated with a set of regions C can be expressed as W c = B c δ where the ith row of B c is the evaluation of the basis functions at region c i . Notice that, under change of support, our process remains similar and we only need to update the basis functions as integrals over the region of interest while the main latent process δ does not need any transformation. This provides a close connection between a subset of the process over any finite set of points S and a set of regions C. Both are simply a linear transformation of the latent GMRF δ with different and known design matrices B s and B c respectively.</p><p>Integrating basis functions: An important aspect in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) is that we should be able to integrate the basis functions over any arbitrary region c. Given that we define two dimensional basis functions as the product of uni-dimensional basis functions, then the integral is s∈c b jl (s)ds = (s 1 ,s 2 )∈c b 1 j (s 1 )b 2 l (s 2 )ds 1 ds 2 . This expression can be reduced for rectangular regions such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">s 1 ∈ [L 1 , U 1 ] and s 2 ∈ [L 2 , U 2 ], s∈c b jl (s)ds = U 1 L 1 b 1 j (s 1 )ds 1 × U 2</formula><p>L 2 b 2 l (s 2 )ds 2 , as it is only required to compute the integral of the univariate basis functions. We use basis functions because the integral can be computed efficiently due to:</p><p>1. The j-th basis spline B jk (x) of order k is non-zero from knot t j to t j+k .</p><p>2. The integral from knot t j to an arbitrary value x is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x t j B j,k (t)dt =            t j+k -t j k s-1 i=j B i,k+1 (x), t j &lt; x ≤ t j+k t j+k -t j k j+k-1 i=j B i,k+1 (x), t j+k &lt; x</formula><p>for s such that t s-1 &lt; x ≤ t s .</p><p>3. The integral can be evaluated from t i to x such that i ≥ j and t i &lt; x ≤ t j+k ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x t i B j,k (t)dt =            t j+k -t j k s-1 r=0 B j+r,k+1 (x) - i-j-1 r=0 B j+r,k+1 (t i ) , t j &lt; x ≤ t j+k t j+k -t j k j+k-1 r=0 B j+r,k+1 (x) - i-j-1 r=0 B j+r,k+1 (t i ) , t j+k &lt; x</formula><p>for s such that t s-1 &lt; x ≤ t s .</p><p>These results led to efficient computation of the integral by: i) evaluating it only when required, according to the local definition of basis splines, and ii) computing the integral depending only on few basis splines at order k + 1. The proofs of these results are provided in Section A of SM. Hence, using linear combinations of basis functions we can integrate the process efficiently and exactly in rectangular geometries. Details of inference and prediction can be found in Section C.1.2 of SM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Spatial Latent Gaussian Model with Change of Support</head><p>We propose a model-based approach to integrate spatial data by extending the spatial latent Gaussian models (SLGM) discussed in Section 2 and leveraging the principles of change of support as outlined in Section 3.1. We begin by presenting a general framework for SLGM with change of support. Later, we provide specific models for the Gaussian and Bernoulli cases and describe key details of Bayesian inference for these models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General framework</head><p>Our approach is founded on the existence of latent continuous processes that underlie the fundamental mechanisms of the studied phenomena. It acknowledges that change of support could also be required under transformations of the latent processes and considers that measurement error is shaped by the characteristics of the observations, independent of the latent process. With these fundamental principles in mind, our approach comprises three key components: the latent Gaussian model, the change of support model, and the observation model. A directed graph representing our model across the three layers is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>The latent Gaussian model closely resembles a linear geostatistical model, where a latent response process {η(s)} is expressed as a function of zero-mean latent predictors {V j (s)} for j = 1, . . . , p and a zero-mean latent spatial process {W (s)}, capturing additional spatial variation. This relationship is defined by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">η(s) = β 0 + V (s) ⊺ β + W (s), for s ∈ S,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In this model, β 0 serves as an intercept parameter, E [η(s)] = β 0 , while β represents a vector of regression coefficients associated with the latent predictors V (s). The latent processes {η(s)} and {V (s)} are linked to the responses and predictors, respectively, which can be observed at either point or aggregated levels.</p><p>The change of support model elucidates how processes within the latent Gaussian model can be projected onto different supports. This projection is not always required for the processes themselves but may be necessary for transformations. We define the change of support for the processes {W (s)}, {V j (s)} and {η(s)} under transformations h w (•), h v j (•) and h η (•) over the geometry c ⊂ S as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">W (c, h w ) = s∈c h w (W (s))ds |c| , V j (c, h v j ) = s∈c h v j (V j (s))ds |c| , η(c, h η ) = s∈c h η (η(s))ds |c| .</formula><p>This notation emphasises that the change of support under a transformation is distinct from the transformation of the change of support, i.e., W (c, h w ) ̸ = h w (W (c)).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaussian case</head><p>In the Gaussian case, both the responses and predictors are assumed to follow a normal distribution. The latent Gaussian model for the process {η(s)} remains consistent with Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">4</ref>. We employ this model with the rationale that the latent process {η(s)} is directly linked to the response of interest {Y (s)} in such a way that, in the absence of measurement error, Y (s) = η(s). Consequently, the aggregated model for any location c ⊂ s could be simply defined as Y (c) = |c| -1 s∈c η(s)ds. Because that change of support is required directly on the latent process (i.e. an identity transformation), the support model with respect to an arbitrary region c ⊂ S comprehend the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">W (c) = |c| -1 s∈c W (s)ds, V j (c) = |c| -1 s∈c V j (s)ds, for j = 1, . . . , p, η(c) = β 0 + V ⊺ (c)β 1 + W (c).</formula><p>(5)</p><p>Notice that, using spatially weighted spline functions, the integrals of the processes are reduced to the linear combinations of the integral with respect to the basis functions as presented in Section 3.1.</p><p>To define the observation model, it is important to note that {η(s)} and {η(c)} represent the process of interest at the point and aggregated levels without measurement error. Therefore, the response variables at the point and aggregated levels are simply a noisy version of the latent process {η(s)}. The extent of measurement error depends on the scale of the sampling units and the measurement instruments associated with the sources of information. Thus, we assume that the characteristics of measurement errors are independent among different sources. Hence, considering l</p><p>[y] ki as the location (point or geometry) of the i-th sampling unit in the k-th source of information for the response variable, the response model accounting for measurement error can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Y k (l [y] ki ) = b k + η(l [y] ki ) + ε k (l [y] ki ), for k = 1, . . . , K and i = 1, . . . , n k , where b k and ε k (l [y] ki ) ∼ N (0, τ 2 k (l [y]</formula><p>ki )) are the intercept and error term of the k-th source of information, respectively. To ensure identifiability of the model, we set b k to zero for the most reliable data source, and the remaining b k terms are interpreted as mean biases relative to the reliable data source. The error term is assumed to be zero-mean and normally distributed with a variance function τ 2 k (l). If the sampling units for a source of information are of the same size, then the variance function can be defined as a constant (i.e., τ 2 k (l) = τ 2 k ). However, if the sampling units are irregular in size, the variance function can be defined in terms of the size of the sampling units (e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">τ 2 k (l) = τ 2 k log(|l|)). Likewise, considering l [x]</formula><p>ji as the location of the i-th sampling unit for the j-th predictor, the predictor model accounting for measurement error can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">X j (l [x] ki ) = α j + V j (l [x] ji ) + ξ j (l [x] ji ), for j = 1, . . . , p and i = 1, . . . , m j ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where α j and ξ j (l</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">[x] ji ) ∼ N (0, ψ 2 j (l [x]</formula><p>ji )) represent the intercept and error term of the j-th predictor, respectively. The variance function ψ 2 j (l) of the error term can also be defined with respect to the observed sampling units, as explained above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bernoulli case</head><p>Our approach can be used for modelling binary outcomes with spatial structure under a change of support. We initially describe the underlying relationship between the point and aggregate level models without measurement error before presenting the complete model.</p><p>Let {Y (s) : s ∈ S} represent a spatial process obtained by binarising the continuous latent process {η(s)} with respect to an unknown threshold γ, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Y (s) = 1, η(s) &gt; γ, 0, η(s) ≤ γ.</formula><p>Here, {η(s)} is the latent process defined in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">4</ref>). Under his model, the probability of success at location s is given by Φ((β 0 -γ)/ V [η(s)]), where Φ(•) represents the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution. This model is not identifiable due to two reasons: (i) an increase in the threshold γ can be offset by an increase in the intercept β 0 , and (ii) a multiplicative factor in W (s) can be compensated by a multiplicative factor in γ, β 0 , and β. An identifiable model can be achieved by fixing a specific value for γ or β 0 , and setting a constant variance for either W (s) or ε(s). To define properly our point-level model, we set γ = 0 and V [W (s)] = 1. It is worth noting that defining the threshold as γ = 0 is equivalent to excluding β 0 from the latent process {η(s)} and using a threshold of -β 0 .</p><p>Since the latent process {η(s)} is inherently linked to the response binary process {Y (s)}, it is natural to the define the aggregated spatial binary process {Y (c) : c ⊂ S} in terms of the aggregated latent process {η(c) : c ⊂ S}. This definition is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Y (c) = 1, η(c) &gt; γ, 0, η(c) ≤ γ.</formula><p>Here, the binarisation of both point and aggregated levels depends on the same threshold γ. Consequently, the probability of success at location c is determined by Φ((</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">β 0 -γ)/ V [η(c)]).</formula><p>Because the aggregated model is derived from the point-level model, the assumptions are propagated. This results in both γ = 0, and a fixed value for</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">V [W (c)] due to V [W (s)] = 1.</formula><p>We use the previous mapping between the point-level and aggregated-level models to formulate the SLGM with a change of support for binary data. First, the latent Gaussian model is the same as in the general case (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">4</ref>), with the restriction that V [W (s)] = 1. Second, the change of support model is the same as in the Gaussian case (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>) with fixed variance for W (c) due to V [W (s)] = 1.</p><p>To define the observation model, consider l</p><p>[y]</p><p>ki as the location (point or geometry) of the i-th sampling unit in the k-th source of information for the response variable.

The inclusion of the additional intercept term b k is equivalent to reducing the binarising threshold to γ -b k . Both approaches can handle varying the likelihood of success among sources. Similar to the Gaussian case, b k is set to zero to the most reliable source of information. The error term ε k (l</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">[y] ki ) ∼ N (0, τ 2 k (l [y]</formula><p>ki )) for the k-th source is assumed to be zero-mean normally distributed with a variance function τ 2 k (l), which may depend on the measure of geometry l. Finally, the predictor model that accounts for measurement error is defined as in Equation (6).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Two dimensional</head><p>Considering a set of sampling units c = {c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n } for any of the four configurations described above, the corresponding observations are treated as realisations of the process {W (s)} over the sampling units c i with an additional measurement error ε i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Y i = s∈c i W (s)ds + ε i , ε i ∼ N (0, σ 2 i ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We assume that the variance of the measurement error is constant (σ 2 i = σ 2 ) when the sampling units have the same size (regular grids). However, it becomes inversely proportional to the area (σ 2 i = σ 2 / |c i |) when they do not (irregular grids, sparse sampling units, and overlapping sampling units). It is worth noting that under this assumption, the measurement error is also influenced by the sampling units.</p><p>We define the latent process W (s) using a linear combination of basis functions, as explained in Section 3.1.2. When sampling units are arranged in a regular grid, we compare two models: a naive model (M1) that uses the centroids of the regions c * i to model the data</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">(Y i = W (c * i ) + ε i</formula><p>) and a support model (M2) that considers the spatial sampling units, as shown in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">7</ref>. On the other hand, when dealing with irregular grids, sparse sampling units, and overlapping sampling units, we compare three models: the naive model (M1) as explained above, a heteroscedastic model (M2) that accounts for the dependence of measurement error on unit sizes, and a support and heteroscedastic model (M3) that simultaneously considers spatial support and measurement error heteroscedasticity.</p><p>Bayesian inference is carried out through Gibbs sampling. In all of our experiments, we generated 10,000 MCMC samples, removed the first 2,000 samples, and retained every 1 out of 5 samples. Subsequently, the continuous latent process is predicted using the MCMC samples and the basis functions associated with the sampling units. The models are compared by analysing the characteristics of the predicted mean function, the uncertainty associated with the prediction, and their posterior probability of overpredicting the true process at m locations within the study area, defined as: p(s j ) = Pr (W (s j ) &gt; w(s j ) | y) , for j = 1, . . . , m.</p><p>(8)</p><p>For this experiment, we define the latent process W (s) using 400 basis functions of degree 2 and a GMRF of order 1 with a scale parameter of κ = 0.09. Similar to the 1-dimensional case, the support model (M2) outperforms the naive model (M1). Specifically, when examining the predicted mean of M1, it becomes evident that this model tends to underestimate the peaks and overestimate the valleys, resulting in more rapid changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, panels B1-B2).</p><p>When analysing the posterior probability of overprediction, we observe that M1 exhibits more frequent values close to 1 and 0, indicating a tendency for overprediction and underprediction respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2-C1</ref>). Conversely, the support model demonstrates a higher frequency of probabilities of overprediction close to 0.5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2-C2</ref>). This behaviour is also linked to the fact that the uncertainty tends to be underestimated for locations near the centroids of the sampling units in the naive model. Irregular grid, sparse sampling units and overlapping sampling units</p><p>For the irregular grid and sparse sampling units experiments, the latent process W (s) was defined with 400 basis functions, while 225 basis functions were used for the experiments with overlapping sampling units. In all three experiments, GMRFs of order 1 with a scale parameter of κ = 0.09 were employed. For all three experiments, we consistently observed that both the naive model (M1) and the heteroscedastic model (M2) tend to underestimate the mean function near peaks and overestimate it around valleys, a behaviour reminiscent of what was observed in regular grids <ref type="bibr">(Figure 11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> in SM; panels B1-B2). Conversely, the support and heteroscedastic model (M3) consistently yields predicted means closer to the true process values for both peaks and valleys <ref type="bibr">(Figure 11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> in SM; panels B3). As a result, the predicted mean range for the support and heteroscedastic model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">M3</ref>) is generally wider compared to that of M1 and M2. This underestimation and overestimation tendency observed in M1 and M2 is reflected in the posterior probability of overprediction, which shows high-frequency values close to 0 and 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>, 12, 13 in SM; panels C1-C2). In contrast, the support and heteroscedastic model (M3) exhibits significantly lower levels of overprediction and underprediction when compared to M1 and M2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>, 12, 13 in SM; panel C3).</p><p>A noteworthy attribute of the support and heteroscedastic model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">M3</ref>) is its proficiency in modelling data acquired under various sampling unit configurations. It captures essential properties of the underlying process and provides a suitable uncertainty quantification, even with sparse and overlapping sampling units. This underscores the effectiveness of the model in predicting the continuous latent process when data are observed on aggregated units.</p></div>

This bias is being accounted for by the intercept parameter α 2 . The key results are observed in Panel (D), where the predictive samples of the latent process η(s) accurately capture its patterns. Importantly, these predictions from binary aggregated outcomes and aggregated predictors do not exhibit the problems of approaches that disregard the support discussed in previous sections. Additionally, the mean bias in the latent predictor V 2 (s) does not introduce bias in the prediction of the main process of interest η(s), as it is effectively compensated by the intercept parameter in the response variable. </p></div>

The latent predictor with respect to growing degree days has a positive effect (CI: 0.881, 1.04) in defining the chance of a cell being improved grassland, while the latent predictor related to soil moisture surplus has also a positive effect (CI: 0.12, 0.274).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prediction</head><p>Our model can provide predictions at different resolutions, considering the properties associated with changes in support. The prediction of the latent land cover at 100m, 500m, and 1km can be observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. All predictions capture the main patterns observed in the distribution of improved grassland (Figure <ref type="figure">4-A</ref>). Particularly, it can be seen that north and west areas have lower levels of improved grassland, and uncertainty is higher in those areas. High levels of latent land cover are predicted even in areas where urban zones are present because we could easily mask out the urban cells and remove their influence. This task is not trivial if land-cover data is aggregated. Additionally, the standard deviation of predictions becomes smaller as we reduce the resolution of the process. Although our model can predict the latent land cover, our primary goal is to predict land suitability, interpreted as the variability explained by intrinsic variables. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> displays the mean and standard deviation of land suitability predictions for improved grassland at 100m, 500m, and 1km resolutions. We observe high levels of suitability in southern areas and low levels are evident in the western regions. Moderately low levels of suitability are found in the north-east. The uncertainty is higher in southern and western areas at different resolutions. Predictions at different resolutions are compatible due to the properties of our approach.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>We developed an extension of SLGM that can accommodate different spatial rectilinear supports for both response and predictor data sources. Our approach consists of three main components: the latent Gaussian model defining system relationships at a continuous level, the change of support model projecting latent processes to other supports, and the observa- tion model describing data generation mechanisms while acknowledging possible mean biases between data sources and heteroscedasticity in measurement errors.</p><p>In this framework, employing a spatial process with a closed form to efficiently handle projection to other supports is crucial. We proposed the use of a linear combination of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF) and basis splines, ensuring that the projection to other supports depends only on the GMRF and the integral of basis splines over geometries of interest. This approach provides computational advantages, as the projection does not need approximations on rectilinear grids. The transparent relationship between the continuous process and the aggregated process is facilitated through the defined GMRF. The model is computationally efficient, leveraging the sparse properties of GMRFs and basis splines, enabling inference and prediction with change of support for large datasets.</p><p>Through data simulation, we assessed the efficacy of our model in one and two-dimensional spaces, considering regular grids, irregular grids, sparse sampling units, and overlapping sampling units. Consistently, we observed that models neglecting the support introduce biases in mean and uncertainty quantification and are more prone to over and underprediction. Conversely, our model captures the main trends of the underlying processes, providing reliable estimates of uncertainty and exhibiting low levels of over and underprediction. We further evaluated the adequacy of our model on a more complex simulated dataset with binary outcomes, different supports for two data sources, and predictors observed at varying resolutions. Our model not only provided predictions about the latent processes but also recovered patterns in the latent response process with reliable uncertainty quantification.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our approach in modeling land cover at a 25m resolution in Rhondda Cynon Taf (Wales), utilizing elevation (25m), growing degree days (1km), and soil moisture surplus (1km). Our model predicted spatial latent processes behind these variables and provided predictions of latent land cover and land suitability for improved grassland at various resolutions (100m, 250m, and 1km) along with associated uncertainties. Our results improved upon previous analyses conducted at a 1km resolution, addressing differences in support and computational challenges.</p><p>Future avenues involve approximating the change of support onto irregular geometries using a quadtree representation or efficient Monte Carlo integration. Additionally, we aim to extend this work to spatial point processes, and model jointly with aggregated count data. This requires establishing an appropriate relationship between aggregated and continuous processes in under transformations of latent processes. Efficient sampling algorithms for the full model are also required due to the presence of several latent processes, which can be achieved by marginalizing some of the latent processes.</p><p>The basis spline of order one is directly derived from Definition 2, and the recursive relationship is established by applying the properties of the k-th divided difference (de Boor, 2001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaussian Processes</head><p>A spatial Gaussian process (GP) is a stochastic process {W (s) : s ∈ D ⊂ R 2 } with a continuous index set. It is characterised by the property that any finite subset of random variables follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rasmussen and Williams, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Diggle and Ribeiro, 2007)</ref>. The process GP(µ(s), κ(s, s * )) is defined by a mean function µ(s) and a covariance function, also known as a kernel function, denoted as Cov [W (s), W (s * )] = κ(s, s * ) for any pair of locations s, s * ∈ D. Gaussian processes are widely utilised for modelling spatial data due to their ability to model dependencies using kernel functions, facilitate statistical inference (both classical and Bayesian), and provide predictions with uncertainty quantification which is crucial for decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaussian Markov Random Fields</head><p>A spatial Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) is a stochastic process {W (c) : c ∈ C} with a discrete index set C = {c 1 , . . . , c n } where each c i represents a non-overlapping region. Let the connectivity of the index set C be defined by the undirected graph G = (V, E) with nodes V and edges E = {{i, j}; i, j ∈ V}.

The precision matrix can usually be decomposed as the product of a scalar precision parameter κ and a structure matrix P . Gaussian Markov random fields are used because they capture the spatial structure based on the connectivity of the index elements, resulting in a sparse precision matrix Q. This sparsity leads to lower computational costs compared to Gaussian processes. The applicability of GMRF is limited to discrete index sets. However, they can also be used to represent Gaussian processes through their connection with stochastic partial differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lindgren et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linear Combinations of Spatial Basis Functions</head><p>Another type of continuous-index spatial stochastic process {W (s) : s ∈ D ⊂ R 2 } can be obtained as a linear combination of q spatial basis functions b i (s) such as W (s) = q i=1 δ i b i (s). Where δ i , for i = 1, . . . , q, are the weights associated to the basis functions. In particular, we focus on the case where the basis functions b i (s) are locally defined and the spatial structure is introduced by defining {δ i } as a GMRF with a two-dimensional regular grid as an index set. More specifically, consider the regular grid with q 1 and q 2 knots corresponding to basis splines {B 1 jk (•) : j = 1, . . . , q 1 } and {B 2 lk (•) : l = 1, . . . , q 2 } of order k for the first and second coordinates, respectively. Then, the spatial process can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">W (s) = q 1 j=1 q 2 l=1 δ jl B 1 jk (s 1 )B 2 lk (s 2 ) = b ⊺ (s)δ, (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_48">)</formula><p>where δ is a q-dimensional GMRF and b(s) is a vector containing the two-dimensional basis functions b jl (s) = B 1 jk (s 1 )B 2 lk (s 2 ) expressed as the tensor product of two sets of onedimensional basis splines of order k. The advantage of using locally defined basis functions and GMRF is that {W (s)} has also sparse properties leading to lower computational costs. Inference: Using the properties of a GP for change of support, we can express the likelihood function for observations with sampling units as points and/or regions to estimate the parameters θ defined in the mean function µ(s) and the covariance function κ(s, s * ). However, it is important to acknowledge that in the most commonly used models, the elements of the covariance matrix cannot be obtained analytically. Therefore, approximation methods, with Monte Carlo integration being the most common, are employed to estimate these quantities at each iteration of the algorithm to obtain the estimates or to obtain samples from the posterior distribution.</p><p>Prediction: Let us consider a setting where we desire predictions at new points and/or regions A * = {s * 1 , . . . , s * ms , c * 1 , . . . , c * mc }.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Simulation studies D.1. One dimensional</head><p>In the one-dimensional experiments, we used the same scenarios and models explained in Section 4.1. We observe results consistent with the two-dimensional case, with some findings that are more pronounced in 2D due to the larger spatial coverage and increased fluctuations of the simulated latent process. The key findings are summarised in the following sections. Irregular grid, sparse sampling units and overlapping sampling units For the irregular grid experiment, the latent process W (s) was defined with 50 basis functions, while 100 basis functions were used for the experiments with sparse and overlapping sampling units. In all three experiments, GMRFs of order 1 with a scale parameter of κ = 1 were employed. The differences between the models observed in Figures 9, 10, and 8 are described below.</p><p>Predicted mean: In the experiment with irregular grids, the naive model (M1) exhibits overfitting similar to the previous experiment with regular grids. It is significantly biased by certain observations due to the lack of accounting for measurement error heteroscedasticity (e.g. for s ≈ 20 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9-A1</ref>). The heteroscedastic model (M2) performs better by considering observation importance based on support size. In the case of sparse sampling units, both the naive model (M1) and the heteroscedastic model (M2) exhibit abrupt changes in the predicted mean, especially evident in sparse locations like s ∈ [-50, 0] in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>, panels A1-A2. In an attempt to fit the data, these models react strongly to the absence of surrounding information. For overlapping sampling units, the predicted mean of the naive model (M1) and the heteroscedastic model (M2) does not overfit when units are close, but in mixed sparse and overlapping regions, they exhibit abrupt changes and overfitting (e.g. for around s ≈ 50 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>, panels A1-A2). Across all three experiments, the support and heteroscedastic model (M3) outperform the naive model (M1) and the heterocedastic model (M2). It yields smoother variation of the predicted mean, avoids overfitting, remains unaffected by high-error observations, and accurately captures primary trends of the underlying true process.</p><p>Uncertainty quantification: In the case of irregular grids, the naive model (M1) tends to overestimate uncertainty because it attempts to increase the variability to capture complex data generation mechanisms. In contrast, the heteroscedastic model (M2) underestimates uncertainty near the sampling unit centroids for sample units of larger size (e.g., s ≈ 35 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref>-A2). For sparse sampling units, both the naive model (M1) and the heteroscedastic model (M2) tend to underestimate uncertainty for locations near the centroids and locations with sparse data (e.g. s ≈ -50 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>, panels A1-A2). In the case of overlapping sampling units, both the naive model (M1) and the heteroscedastic model (M2) tend to underestimate uncertainty for locations near the centroids. For all three experiments, the support and heteroscedastic model (M3) consistently quantifies uncertainty effectively without underestimating it for locations close to the centroids, as observed in M1 and M2, or overestimating it. M3 provides a more accurate quantification of uncertainty, effectively enveloping the underlying true process.</p><p>Over and under prediction: In all the conducted experiments, we observed a higher proportion of posterior probabilities close to 1 or 0 for the naive model (M1) and the heteroscedastic model (M2), as shown in panels B1-B3 of Figures 9, 10, and 8. In contrast, the support and heteroscedastic model (M3) consistently exhibits lower levels of overprediction and underprediction when compared to models M1 and M2, with more frequent probabilities centred around 0.5. This suggests that M3 provides more accurate predictions of the underlying true process.       </p></div>

We then explore common spatial stochastic processes utilized in spatial latent Gaussian models (SLGM) in Section B. Additionally, we discuss the theory of SLGM with change of support in Section C, covering Bayesian inference and spatial prediction. Further details on simulation studies are provided in Section D. The MCMC algorithm chains for our case study are showcased in Section E. Lastly, spatial prediction of the latent processes for land suitability is presented in Section F.</p></div>

These differences stem from the approach of the support model for finding functions whose integrals closely match the data.</p><p>• Over and under prediction: The naive model (M1) exhibits more frequent values where the probability of overprediction is close to 1 and close to 0 (indicating underprediction), as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>-B1.
