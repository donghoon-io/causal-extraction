			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objectives: Despite the unequivocal benefits of regular physical activity, many parents engage in lower levels of physical activity (PA) following the birth of a child. Drawing on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and health action process approach (HAPA), an integrative model was developed to examine variables predicting PA in parents of very young children. In addition, key beliefs related to PA intentions and behaviour among parents of very young children were investigated. Design: A prospectivecorrelational design with two waves of data collection, spaced one week apart, was adopted. Methods: Parents (N = 297) completed an online or paper-based questionnaire assessing TPB global constructs and belief-based items as well as family social support and planning from the HAPA. One week later, parents self-reported their PA behaviour. Data were analysed using latent variable structural equation modelling. Results: Findings revealed the model was a good fit to the data, accounting for 62% and 27% of the variance in PA intentions and behaviour, respectively. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control predicted intentions. Family social support failed to predict both planning and intentions. Physical activity was predicted by planning only, with an indirect effect occurring from intentions to behaviour through planning. A number of key beliefs on intentions and behaviour were also identified. Conclusions:</p><p>This formative research provides further understanding of the factors that influence the PA behaviour of parents of very young children. Results provide targets for future interventions to increase PA for parents in a transition phase where PA levels decline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The extant literature is unequivocal on the positive effects of physical activity (PA) on people's physical and psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bize, Johnson, &amp; Plontikoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Warburton, Charlesworth, Ivey, Nettlefold, &amp; Bredin, 2010)</ref>. For new parents, regular PA may be especially important for losing weight that may have been gained in pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ostbye et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pivarnik et al., 2006)</ref>, and as a buffer against postnatal depression in the first year postpartum <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Teychenne &amp; York, 2013)</ref>. Despite these benefits, research demonstrates that while 54% of couples without children met PA guidelines, only 34% of parents achieved the recommended PA levels <ref type="bibr">(Rhodes et al., 2014)</ref>. Although parents of very young children (i.e., children under the age of 1 year) experience barriers to engaging in regular PA such as family caregiving, limited time, and lack of social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bellows-Riecken &amp; Rhodes, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hamilton &amp; White, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McIntyre &amp; Rhodes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nomaguchi &amp; Bianchi, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pereira et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sallis et al., 2001)</ref>, opportunities exist for parents to be physically active such as incidental activities that occur in the context of household responsibilities or family activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2010)</ref>. Understanding the decision making of parents of very young children around this important health-enhancing behaviour is therefore important.</p><p>Previous research has identified factors that influence parental PA using psychological models of behavioural decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hamilton, Cox, &amp; White, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hamilton &amp; White, 2012)</ref>. By applying such models to understand behaviour, modifiable factors can be identified that aid the facilitation of behavioural interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hagger, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hamilton et al. (2012)</ref> argued for the need to consider multiple theoretical perspectives when understanding health-related behaviours such as PA in parents of young children. Integrative models offer a more comprehensive articulation of the complexity of psychological processes guiding health behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hagger, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hamilton &amp; Hagger, 2014)</ref>. Supporting this proposition, several researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnautovska, Fleig, O'Callaghan, &amp; Hamilton, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Conner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hagger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hagger &amp; Chatzisarantis, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2012)</ref> have advocated for the integration of popular social-cognitive models, such as the theory of planned behaviour (TPB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, with complementary theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Bases to Explain PA Behaviour of Parents of Very Young Children</head><p>The TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> is a prominent decision making model that has been used to explain social and health behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McEachan, Conner, Taylor, &amp; Lawton, 2011)</ref>, including PA <ref type="bibr">(Downs, &amp; Hausenblas, 2005a)</ref>. The TPB posits intention as the proximal predictor of behaviour, with intention predicted by attitude (overall evaluations of the behaviour), subjective norm (perceived social pressure to perform the behaviour), and perceived behavioural control (PBC, perceived capacity to carry out the behaviour), with PBC further hypothesised to predict behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. A further feature of the TPB is its theorising that attitude, subjective norm, and PBC are underpinned by key behavioural beliefs (costs and benefits), normative beliefs (others' approval and disapproval), and control beliefs (motivators and inhibitors), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Although elicitation of these beliefs (i.e., indirect measures) is considered a strength of the TPB, this formative process is often neglected and researchers have largely focused on global measures (i.e., direct measures) of attitude, subjective norm, and PBC as antecedents of intention and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chan et al., 2015)</ref>. The global measures are merely summative states of more fundamental lower-level elements (i.e., beliefs); thus, the action of behaviour change is at the belief, rather than summative, level. Changing the global constructs, therefore, occurs through modifying the underpinning beliefs, which have been identified as the key targets for behavior change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hardeman et al., 2002)</ref>. To determine the key direct constructs (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and PBC) that influence intentions and behaviour, a predictive model is often used; whereas to identify the key indirect beliefs (i.e., behavioural, normative, and control beliefs) that can be used as targets for intervention, general principles as set out by von Haeften, <ref type="bibr">Fishbein, Kasprzyk, and Montano (2001)</ref> are often used (see Data Analysis Overview section of the Method section below as an example).</p><p>The TPB has been applied successfully to the prediction of PA for parents of young children (i.e., aged under 5 years old; <ref type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2012)</ref>. Further, a growing number of studies have shown efficacy in applying a TPB belief-based approach to examine key beliefs underpinning health behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(French &amp; Cooke, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hamilton, Spinks, White, Kavanagh, &amp; Walsh, 2016)</ref>, including beliefs specifically related to PA for transitioning populations; that is, people who are experiencing important life transitions such as entering university or having a child <ref type="bibr">(Cowie &amp; Hamilton, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hamilton &amp; White, 2011)</ref>. Parents of very young children are particularly at-risk for PA declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bellows-Riecken &amp; Rhodes, 2008)</ref> and, thus, may require specific investigation due to the extra burdens faced during early parenting such as difficulty adjusting and increased risk for mental illness <ref type="bibr">(Edhborg, Matthieson, Lundh, &amp; Widstrom, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pereira et al., 2007)</ref>. While existing research provides valuable insight into the psychological factors underpinning PA behaviour, relevant factors for parents of very young children may be distinct. Identifying key social-cognitive constructs, as well as important beliefs guiding decision making, can be used to develop theory-and evidence-based health messages relevant to the target behaviour and group.</p><p>Although the TPB has well-documented shortcomings (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sniehotta, Presseau, &amp; Araujo-Soares, 2014)</ref>, it is argued that the model remains a useful framework to adopt as a starting point to better understand human behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Conner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hagger, 2015)</ref>. Considering these arguments, it may be useful to investigate other important constructs in this context. One aspect of the TPB that has continued to be questioned is the notable intention-behaviour gap, reflecting the fact that people do not always act on their good intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sheeran, 2002)</ref>. While the TPB is commonly considered a motivational model, suggesting that impetus is sufficient to achieve behavioural enactment, behavioural enactment models focus on the strategies that enable the translation of intention into action <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baban &amp; Craciun, 2007)</ref>. Thus, volitional constructs such as planning and social resources (e.g., social support) proposed in the health action process approach (HAPA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schwarzer, 2008)</ref> may be useful to consider in the context of PA of parents of very young children, especially considering routines in this transition phase often need to be adjusted and plans and support may help to overcome barriers.</p><p>Planning is a self-regulatory strategy, whereby an individual conceptualises when, where, and how to enact a behaviour and how to overcome barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sniehotta, 2009)</ref>. Planning has an important influence upon the intention-behaviour relationship, as the act of planning increases the likelihood that behavioural intentions will be translated into action. Planning is distinct from action, with the consideration of the context for future behaviour enabling the individual to identify opportunities for action <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton, Bonham, Bishara, Kroon, &amp; Schwarzer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sheeran, Webb, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2005)</ref>. Planning has been empirically verified as a mediator in the intentionbehaviour relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carraro &amp; Gaudreau, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hagger &amp; Luszczynska, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Despite empirical support for planning within both the HAPA and TPB models (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Norman &amp; Conner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wienert, Kuhlmann, Fink, Hambrecht, &amp; Lippke, 2016)</ref>, no studies have investigated the mediating effect of planning for parents of very young children. The investigation of influences upon PA for parents is important as this group possesses complex beliefs and attitudes regarding PA engagement that are affect-laden and account for perceived pressures from various parties, including family members and society <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2010)</ref>. Further, parents of very young children are at heightened risk for the development of psychological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Buist et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Edmondson, Psychogiou, Vlachos, Netsi, &amp; Ranchandani, 2010)</ref>. This risk may be due to various pressures and conflicting demands experienced by parents who seek to provide adequate care for their children, as well as maintain employment or look after other children, and experience normative pressures to engage in prosocial health behaviours such as PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McIntyre &amp; Rhodes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pereira et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Social support is a resource factor which refers to the quality of social relationships, and according to the HAPA, is relevant across both preintentional and postintentional phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schwarzer, 2008)</ref>. It is a functional exchange of comfort, assistance, and/or information from important others <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schwarzer &amp; Knoll, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wallston, Alagna, DeVellis, &amp; DeVellis, 1983)</ref>. Social support is related to PA behaviour, as it can compensate for lower self-regulatory capabilities and limited selfefficacy in relation to the planning for, and enactment of behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schwarzer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Warner et al., 2011)</ref>. Social support has been validated for its contribution to understanding PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rhodes, Jones, &amp; Courneya, 2002)</ref>, and has been related to PA engagement for parents of young children <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2012)</ref>. Few studies, however, have simultaneously investigated the roles of social support and planning on health behaviour and, in particular for parents of very young children. Such factors may be especially important to this target group, who are typically inactive, face many barriers to PA, and may possess lower volitional strength to develop and enact plans to be active. While social support can be received from various distal (e.g., friends, work colleagues) or proximal (e.g., partner, family members) individuals or groups, family social support may be particularly relevant for parents of very young children who prioritise the influence of proximal others (e.g., family; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mailey, Huberty, Dinkel, &amp; McAuley, 2014)</ref>. The prioritisation of support from family may occur due to the maintenance of similar values and because family members may be more available to provide practical support to a parent (e.g., provision of childcare; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mailey et al., 2014)</ref>. The current study therefore focused on family social support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>Drawing from the TPB and the HAPA, we aimed to test an integrative model of PA among a sample of parents of children under the age of 1 year. An additional aim was to identify key PA beliefs in this target group. In line with the TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, we expected attitude (Hypothesis 1), subjective norm (Hypothesis 2), and PBC (Hypothesis 3) would predict PA intentions; and intentions (Hypothesis 4) and PBC (Hypothesis 5) would predict PA behaviour (Hypothesis 5). In line with the HAPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schwarzer, 2008)</ref> and prior TPB research <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rhodes et al., 2002)</ref>, we expected a direct predictive path between social support (family) and intentions (Hypothesis 6) and planning (Hypothesis 7), and a mediational path from intention through planning to PA behaviour (Hypothesis 8). In addition, we sought to investigate the beliefs that underpin parental decision making in this context which can inform potential targets for future intervention studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Procedure</head><p>The study used a prospective-correlation design with a one week follow-up.</p><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the University Human Research Ethics Committee.</p><p>Prior to data collection for the main study, a pilot study was conducted, where participants (13 mothers, 7 fathers, Meanage = 31.33) completed an online survey comprising open-ended questions based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975)</ref> recommendations to elicit behavioural, normative, and control beliefs for the target behaviour. Content analysis was performed on the responses and frequently occurring items were used to form the TPB belief-based measures in the T1 questionnaire. At T1, participants completed direct (intention, attitude, subjective norm, and PBC) and indirect belief-based (behavioural, normative, and control beliefs) measures of the TPB as well as measures of planning and social support from the HAPA. Demographic details were also collected at T1. Participants received an information sheet outlining the details of the study and consent was assumed by submitting the questionnaire. One week following T1 (to reduce recall bias), consenting participants were contacted by email and/or text message to complete the T2 online follow-up questionnaire. Data were de-identified and matched using a participant-generated unique code identifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The target behaviour was regular physical activity, and operationalized based on the Australian Government Department of Health ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) guidelines of accumulating 150 -300 minutes of moderate-intensity PA or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity PA, or an equivalent of both moderate and vigorous activities each week. Psychological constructs were developed using standardised guidelines, validated in previous studies and adapted for this study's target behaviour in the current study. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> for details of measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TPB global measures.</head><p>Multi-item psychometric measures of intention (four items), attitude (four items), subjective norm (three items), and PBC (three items) were developed based on TPB guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Planning. Planning was measured using eight items comprising both action planning (plans of when, where, and how to do PA) and coping planning (plans to cope with my setbacks to PA) adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sniehotta, Schwarzer, Scholz, and Schuz (2005)</ref>.</p><p>Social support. Social support from family was assessed using the five-item family support for exercise habit scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sallis, Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, &amp; Nader, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>TPB belief-based measures. All belief-based items were elicited from a previous pilot study. Items (N = 20) were scored on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = extremely unlikely to 7 = extremely likely). Refer to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> for details of the beliefs.</p><p>For behavioural beliefs, participants rated how likely four benefits (e.g., "improve my physical health") and four costs (e.g., "take time away from other activities") would be if they performed the target behaviour over the next week. For normative beliefs, participants rated how likely five salient individuals/groups (e.g., "family") were to think they should perform the target behaviour over the next week. For control beliefs, participants rated how likely seven factors (e.g., "limited time") would prevent them from performing the target behaviour over the next week.</p><p>Follow-up behaviour. Two items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hamilton and White (2008)</ref> assessed follow-up PA behaviour performed by parents over the previous week.</p><p>Participants were provided the operationalised definition of PA and were encouraged to consider to what degree they did regular PA over the past week based on this definition.</p><p>(Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> near here)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis Overview</head><p>Computations were performed with SPSS 22, SPSS Process macro <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hayes, 2013)</ref>, and MPLUS Version 7.4 (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2011). To explore the mediation hypothesis, a manifest variable model was specified in which planning was the putative mediator, regressed onto PA intention, whereas PA behaviour was regressed on intentions and planning. Confidence intervals (95%) were generated by bootstrapping with 5000 resamples. Listwise deletion of missing values was applied. The model was then re-specified as a multiple-indicator latent-variable model and analysed with MPLUS using maximum likelihood estimation which accounts for missing data. The integrative model consisted of six latent variables including attitude, subjective norm, PBC, social support, planning, and behaviour. All latent variables were specified with the manifest indicators described in the Measures section. Sex of parent, age of child, and number of children were included as control variables. Model fit was assessed based on the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) which should approach or exceed .95 for good fit, and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standard root mean square residual (SRMR), which should be close to or less than .06 for good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>To identify the key beliefs underlying parental PA, based on previous approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hamilton, Spinks et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Vayro &amp; Hamilton, 2016)</ref> and as per recommendations outlined by von Haeften et al. ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>), Pearson product-moment correlation matrixes were first used to identify the beliefs that significantly correlated with intentions and behaviour for a combined sample of parents. Second, within each belief-based measure, the significant key beliefs were entered into a multiple regression analysis to identify those beliefs that made independent contributions to intentions and behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations for all study variables in the integrative model are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Parents had moderately strong intentions for PA (M = 5.22, SD = 1.64) and engaged in a moderate amount of PA (M = 3.59, SD = 1.60). Except for subjective norm which did not correlate with behaviour, all predictor variables correlated with intentions and behaviour.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attrition Analysis</head><p>Attrition analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between participants that dropped out relative to those that remained in the study in age (t(290) = .02, p = .988), gender (χ 2 (1) = .86, p = .35), marital status (χ 2 (2) = .40, p = .82), highest educational achievement (χ 2 (4) = 3.97, p = .41), relationship type (χ 2 (1) = .06, p = .80), or ethnicity (χ 2 (1) = .15, p = .70). Further, no significant multivariate effect (Wilks' Lambda = .975, F(7,165) = .60, p = .76) was identified between participants that dropped out of the study and those who completed the T2 assessment for the test variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, intention, social support, and planning).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analysis with Manifest Variables</head><p>In the single-indicator manifest variable model, the following unstandardized parameters were estimated. The effect of PA intention on planning was b = .71, CI 95% (.58, .83), the effect of planning on PA behaviour was b = .29, CI 95% (.14, .44), and the effect of intention on PA behaviour was b = .23, CI 95% (.06, .40). The total indirect effect of intention on PA behaviour via planning was b = .20, CI 95% (.05, .34).</p><p>Of the PA behaviour variance, 25% was accounted for by these predictors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Analysis with Latent Variables</head><p>A structural equation model was specified in which each factor had more than one indicator. All items that were assessed for each construct were chosen to serve as indicators. The initial model was a poor fit to the data (CFI = .800, TLI = .778, RMSEA = .114, SRMR = .085,  2 (446) = 2132.87, p &lt; .001,  2 /df = 4.78). Modification indices suggested the model would be improved significantly with the inclusion of covariances between the items comprising the latent variables (e.g., attitude item 1 and attitude item 2). The addition of covariances resulted in an improvement to model fit (CFI = .951, TLI = .943, RMSEA = .058, SRMR = .068,  2 (423) = 837.43, p = .00,  2 /df = 1.98).</p><p>The model accounted for 62% of the variance in PA intentions (which was significantly predicted by attitude, subjective norm, and PBC) and 27% of the variance in PA behaviour (which was significantly predicted by number of children).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key TPB Belief-Based Analysis of Intentions and Behaviour</head><p>For parents, means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations of behavioural, normative, and control beliefs related to PA intentions and behaviour are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, a range of beliefs were revealed as being associated with intentions and behaviour. Multiple regression analyses identified three behavioural beliefs ("improve my physical health"; "take time away from other activities"; "aid in weight loss/healthy weight maintenance"), one normative belief ("family"), and two control beliefs ("motivation" and "limited time") were significantly associated with intention. A further multiple regression analysis identified two behavioural beliefs ("take time away from other activities" and "improve my mental health"), no normative beliefs, and three control beliefs ("lack of motivation", "cost", and "lack of an established routine with my child/children") were significantly associated with behaviour (see Table <ref type="table">6</ref>).</p><p>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> and 6 near here)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of the current study was to use an integrative theoretical model based on the TPB and HAPA for the prediction of PA for parents of very young children and to identify key beliefs for potential future intervention. Current results showed all three TPB variables (attitude, subjective norm, and PBC) as statistically significant predictors of intentions, supporting Hypothesis 1, 2, and 3. Social support did not contribute to the prediction of PA intentions or planning, rejecting Hypotheses 6 and 7. Further, according to the latent structural model neither intentions or PBC directly predicted behaviour, rejecting Hypothesis 4 and 5. However, according to the mediation analysis an indirect effect between intention and behaviour through planning was confirmed, supporting Hypothesis 8. Finally, key beliefs that significantly predicted PA intention and behaviour were identified for parents of very young children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting Physical Activity for Parents of Very Young Children</head><p>Given the significant contribution of the TPB constructs to the variance in intention, current findings highlight the importance of having favourable attitudes, perceived social pressure from important others, and confidence and control related to PA for the development of strong intentions to undertake regular PA. These findings are consistent with previous research among parents of children under the age of 5 years <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2012)</ref>. In contrast, the finding of a nonsignificant contribution of social support to intention is inconsistent with previous literature <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2012)</ref>. While support for parents of young children to engage in regular PA has previously been verified, low levels of social support received from family members reported in the current sample may suggest that social support is not a priority when forming PA intentions. Previous research has suggested an interference effect, whereby the receipt of support as well as having high levels of self-efficacy may result in negative reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Warner et al., 2011)</ref>. While the current study did not investigate the moderating effect of social support and self-efficacy, it is possible that, due to the greater influence of PBC (similar to self-efficacy) on intention, participants did not prioritise social support when forming PA intentions. The moderate endorsement of PBC (M = 4.67; 7-point scale) in comparison to low levels of social support from family members (M = 2.39; 5-point scale) in the current study is comparable to previous research whereby individuals who reported higher self-efficacy experienced greater levels of autonomy when levels of social support were reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Warner et al., 2011)</ref>. It is possible that parents in the current study prioritised a sense of confidence and control rather than support from others, which may boost their sense of autonomy.</p><p>Notably, the path between social support and planning was also non-significant, suggesting that the receipt of social support from family members may not inform parents' decisions to make plans to be active. In contrast to current findings, previous research has shown a significant path between social support and planning (Reyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fernandez, Montenegro, Knoll, &amp; Schwarzer, 2014)</ref>. Despite previous research suggesting that a supportive social network may be particularly important to buffer an individual's volitional strength to develop and enact plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schwarzer, 2008)</ref>, the current sample of parents of very young children may not prioritise the receipt of social support from others in relation to their PA behaviour. This result may occur because of the possibility that parents place greater value on the quality (not assessed in the current study), rather than the quantity, of social support received. Thus, future research should investigate the perceived quality of support received by parents of very young children.</p><p>Importantly, social support may be obtained from various other sources, including friends or work colleagues, which should be investigated in future research.</p><p>Another reason for the non-significant findings for family social support may be that the measure used in the current study addressed the provision of encouragement, rather than the provision of practical support such as childminding. Previous research has shown this more practical type of support to be a priority for parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mailey et al., 2014)</ref>. For this population, giving helpful reminders may be of little assistance if no one is able to provide childminding, which would then enable a parent to engage in PA.</p><p>Further, the role of support as provided by friends or peers was not considered in the current study. Parents may be more likely to engage in regular PA if they are able to do so within a supportive group of peers. The provision of practical support, including that provided by peers should be addressed in future research.</p><p>Current findings also failed to support the prediction of PA behaviour through typical TPB pathways (i.e., intention and PBC). Meta-analyses partially reflect the results found in the current study; intentions but not PBC was shown to predict PA behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Downs &amp; Hausenblas, 2005a)</ref>. However, in the current study, intention also did not predict behaviour, but rather a full mediation effect from intention to behaviour through planning was found for this sample. Previous research findings have mirrored this effect, whereby including planning as a mediator in the intention-behaviour relationship resulted in a non-significant direct relationship between intention and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sniehotta, Scholz, &amp; Schwarzer, 2004)</ref>. These findings suggest that planning when, where, and how to do an activity, and how to cope with setbacks is a necessary step in order for parents of very young children to translate their intentions into PA behaviour. In relation to the PBC-behaviour link, previous research investigating a transitioning group of first generation college students also determined a non-significant contribution of PBC, citing that such students may have a poor conceptualisation of their control and confidence regarding regular PA enactment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allom, Mullan, Cowie, &amp; Hamilton, 2016)</ref>. More broadly, exercise-related research has also demonstrated that individuals tend to overestimate their control over PA behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Sheeran, Trafimow, &amp; Armitage, 2005)</ref>. Similar processes may be occurring for parents of very young children who perceive the barriers to outweigh their capacity to overcome the obstacles to doing regular PA. Other factors, such as the ability to plan to overcome such barriers, are possibly more important.</p><p>In addition, current findings provide support for the addition of a volitional phase to social-cognitive models of PA, with planning confirmed as a mediator of the intention-behaviour relationship, which is consistent with previous findings <ref type="bibr">(Carraro &amp; Gaudrea, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Caudroit, Boiche, &amp; Stephan, 2014)</ref>, including studies on PA of parents of children under the age of 5 years <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton et al., 2012)</ref>. Planning may be particularly important due to the physical and psychological barriers experienced in relation to PA engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2010)</ref>. These barriers, as well as the tendency for individuals to have a poor conceptualisation of their control <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sheeran et al., 2003)</ref>, may reduce the likelihood of a parent to convert intentions into PA behaviour.</p><p>Thus, formulating a specific plan regarding when, where, and how to do PA, as well as how to cope with barriers to stick to the plan, is important for increased PA engagement in parents of very young children.</p><p>It should also be noted that, given the effect of number of children in the current study, the role of this demographic variable on PA behaviour should be considered when examining parents' health behaviour. Specifically, the findings showed that parents with more children were associated with lower levels of PA. This finding is consistent with previous research which demonstrated that women with more than two children were less likely to engage in PA, reporting family obligations as a barrier to engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown, Brown, Miller, &amp; Hansen., 2001)</ref>. This finding suggests the need for additional support for parents of multiple children to overcome the barriers that reduce their PA engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Beliefs Predicting Physical Activity Intentions and Behaviour</head><p>Current findings also identified key behavioural, normative, and control beliefs relevant for parents' PA that can be used as targets for behaviour change, a process often neglected in TPB research. The identification of behavioural beliefs suggests that evaluations of positive and negative outcomes are considered when parents of very young children consider engaging in PA. Parents identified "improve my physical health", "improve my mental health", and "weight loss/maintenance" as positive outcomes relevant for PA decisions. Parents also identified "take time away from other activities" as a potential negative outcome arising from PA. These findings are similar to a study of PA beliefs for parents of young children, where benefits to wellbeing was identified as a positive outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2011)</ref>. Thus, promoting consideration of positive outcomes of PA engagement may aid in improving parents' beliefs towards PA, in turn influencing their intentions and PA behaviour. Current results also highlight that parents may emphasise a focus on weight loss/maintenance, possibly reflecting the struggle with postpartum weight loss that is frequently reported among mothers of young children, and weight gain experienced by both mothers and fathers postpartum <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Laroche et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Montgomery, Best, Aniello, Phillips, &amp; Hatmaker-Flanigan, 2012)</ref>. Key normative beliefs were also relevant to parents' decision making for PA, identifying "family" as an important social influence in this context. Previous research has identified family as having a social influence on PA <ref type="bibr">(Downs &amp; Hausenblas, 2005b)</ref>.</p><p>While mothers and fathers may value the distal influence of role models who support PA engagement, the prioritisation of proximal others (e.g., family) may arise from holding shared values, for example, physical wellbeing. Thus, family/partners who value PA may facilitate negotiation to ensure that time is available for each party to be active in their leisure time <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mailey, Huberty, Dinkel, &amp; McAuley, 2014)</ref>. The results of previous research have shown that social referent groups for parents who provide performance-related feedback form a key component in health-related intervention strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, &amp; Gupta, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, control beliefs about the ease or difficulty to perform regular PA were important. Consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hamilton &amp; White, 2011)</ref>, "lack of motivation", "limited time", "cost", and "lack of an established routine with my child/children" emerged as key beliefs related to decisions for PA for parents of very young children. The belief relating to routine may reflect the challenges parents of very young children face in this transition period, such as establishing an effective sleep routine which is particularly relevant in the first year of a child's life <ref type="bibr">(Cook et al., 2012)</ref>. Due to limited motivation, time, finances, and poorly established routines, parents may require the provision of additional support and strategies to increase their perception of control over performing PA. Previous findings in relation to health promotion interventions suggest that providing specific strategies (e.g., the formation of specific goals related to an individual's situation), may aid in the improvement of control beliefs, and subsequently, increase PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Michie et al., 2009)</ref>. Other evidencebased strategies to increase self-efficacy and PA include vicarious experience (i.e., seeing a similar person performing the behaviour) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ashford, Edmunds, &amp; French, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Strengths and Limitations</head><p>The strengths of the current study include the application of an integrative theoretical model to the prediction of PA in both mothers and fathers of very young children and identification of key beliefs related to PA engagement that can be used in future interventions to improve the PA of parents in this transition phase. The current study also has limitations. A correlational design was used which means that causality can only be presumed based on the theoretical basis, rather than the findings of the analysis of the data. Experimental manipulation of theoretical constructs and assessing their influence on behaviour change is needed to support the proposed pathways of the integrative model. Further, for a comprehensive understanding of the contribution that underlying TPB beliefs make to the integrative model, a full SEM analysis with the beliefs incorporated should be undertaken, sample size permitting given the additional parameters. The sample comprised largely of married, higher educated individuals from English speaking backgrounds which limits generalisability of current findings. A considerable portion of data collection occurred within contexts that promote healthenhancing behaviours (e.g., swim schools), and thus, may have resulted in a bias towards more health-conscious parents. The use of self-report measurement of PA may be less accurate than an objective assessment of PA levels. Previous research, however, has demonstrated that self-report measures are reliable and valid in assessing PA levels <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Milton, Bull, &amp; Bauman, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The current study tested an integrative model incorporating TPB and HAPA to PA of parents of very young children. Overall, we found support for many of the proposed effects among the factors in the model as well as identified key beliefs that were associated with parents' decisions to be active. Current findings support the importance of using integrative theoretical approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex health behaviours. The addition of a volitional phase to motivational theories enables a greater conceptualisation of the factors that promote behavioural enactment, particularly for vulnerable and transitioning populations who experience barriers to being active. Practically, current results provide valuable insights into the psychosocial factors that may influence parents' decisions to do PA. Further, the key beliefs identified have an important application to the construction of targeted intervention programs and strategies; addressing barriers to PA performance, promoting beliefs regarding the benefits of PA, and highlighting the positive influence of important referent social groups. By increasing regular PA of parents in a transition phase that is typically associated with lower levels of physical activity, it is hoped that parents would also experience greater psychological wellbeing, reduced likelihood of developing postnatal depression, and increased physical health outcomes. behaviors in sport: Examining an extended model of the theory of planned behavior.
