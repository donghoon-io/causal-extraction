<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a generative model for the spatiotemporal distribution of high dimensional categorical observations. These are commonly produced by robots equipped with an imaging sensor such as a camera, paired with an image classifier, potentially producing observations over thousands of categories. The proposed approach combines the use of Dirichlet distributions to model sparse co-occurrence relations between the observed categories using a latent variable, and Gaussian processes to model the latent variable's spatiotemporal distribution. Experiments in this paper show that the resulting model is able to efficiently and accurately approximate the temporal distribution of high dimensional categorical measurements such as taxonomic observations of microscopic organisms in the ocean, even in unobserved (held out) locations, far from other samples. This work's primary motivation is to enable deployment of informative path planning techniques over high dimensional categorical fields, which until now have been limited to scalar or low dimensional vector observations.</p></div>

Sites of research interest in outer space and the deep ocean are characterized by being extremely inhospitable to human life and difficult to reach from the Earth's surface via radio-frequency communications. But by making higherlevel decisions on-board, autonomous agents reduce the need for real-time communications with a human operator. The effectiveness of any autonomous agent, in terms of valuable information acquired per unit resource, depends largely on the plan it is programmed to follow. But remote environments are often under-explored, and thus the optimal plan is not known before the mission starts. Therefore, autonomous agents require plans that adapt to the environments they encounter, or informative path planning (IPP).</p><p>Robots performing adaptive sampling or IPP missions typically operate over measurements of interest that are low dimensional. For example, in the context of underwater robotic missions, IPP has been used to adaptively sample physical <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, chemical <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, biological <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and general visual signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in the ocean (for more details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). IPP techniques require a spatial model ment at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution yogi@whoi.edu for the information that is being sampled <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Gaussian processes (GPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which are capable of modeling black-box scalar or vector functions, are a common choice of probabilistic observation model for IPP. GP models enable IPP algorithms to produce smooth estimates over future observations, along with uncertainties, which can then be used to predict expected trajectory reward and to balance the exploration-versus-exploitation trade-off using Bayesian Optimisation (BO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have enabled development of new types of sensing systems that effectively measure high-dimensional categorical data. These systems combine traditional sensors (cameras, probes, etc.) with deep neural networks to classify scalar, vector, and image-based measurements in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Examples of such systems include classifiers trained using datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> produced by the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that can produce taxonomic observations of phytoplankton with over 100 categories, and classifiers trained on the ImageNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which can produce categorical observations over 10,000 categories. IPP techniques based on GP models do not directly generalize to such high-dimensional categorical observations as common embedding methods (such as one-hot encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) embed a Kcategorical variable in K dimensions, leading to exponential space complexity. Hierarchical Bayesian models designed for spatio-temporal data, such as HDP-ROST <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, can efficiently model distributions of high dimensional categorical observations. But these models do not provide smoothly varying probability distribution estimates at arbitrary locations in space and time, which are needed for BO based IPP. Thus, there is a need for a spatio-temporal model of the distribution of high-dimensional categorical data compatible with IPP.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian-Dirichlet Random Field (GDRF), a hierarchical generative topic model for the spatial distribution of categorical observations. As shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, GDRFs factor the probability distribution over observation categories w into conditional distributions for w given a latent topic z, and conditional distributions of the latent topics given the observation's location x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (w|x) = z P (w|z)P (z|x)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Since w and z are both categorical random variables, (1) remains unusable for IPP. Therefore, we further factor P (z|x) by introducing a latent Gaussian random field µ i for each topic, normalized to a distribution via a link function f i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (z i |x) = f i (µ 1 (x), . . . , µ K (x))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>To learn the word-topic model and the latent µ i , we combine Gibbs sampling with variational inference. An immediate consequence of our choice of factorization is that the topics in a GDRF model are scientifically meaningful in that they capture the latent spatiotemporal structures relating different observation categories.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. GAUSSIAN-DIRICHLET RANDOM FIELDS</head><p>We begin with several preliminary definitions. A GDRF is defined on an indexing set X = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . }, representing points in the world on which the model is defined. For example, a GDRF on a two-dimensional A × B grid has as its indexing set X = {1, 2, . . . , A} × {1, 2, . . . , B}. We will generally refer to the indexing set itself as the world, and call members of the world locations.</p><p>Words w i and topics z i are W -and K-categorical variables, respectively. The mean latent log probabilities (MLLPs) µ j are Gaussian random fields defined on the world X. MLLPs are transformed to a probability distribution via a link function f j : R K → [0, 1], where j f j (µ 1 , . . . , µ K ) = 1 . For this paper, we exclusively use the softmax link function f j (µ 1 , . . . , µ K ) = exp(µ j )/ k exp(µ k ). Finally, the generative model contains several hyperparameters: β is the Dirichlet parameter controlling the word distribution for each topic, and M i and Σ i are respectively the mean and covariance function of the Gaussian process from which µ i are drawn.</p><p>Given a set of N (not necessarily unique) members of the indexing set, {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N }, latent probabilities for K topics, as well as topics and words, are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">µ j ∼ N (M i , Σ i ) , j ∈ [1..K] Φ z ∼ Dirichlet (β) , z ∈ {z 1 , . . . , z K } z i ∼ f (µ 1 (x i ), . . . , µ K (x i )), i ∈ [1..N ] w i ∼ Φ zi , i ∈ [1..N ]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The graphical model for GDRFs is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE OF GAUSSIAN-DIRICHLET RANDOM FIELDS</head><p>Assume we have collected a set of N categorical observations {w i } associated with N locations in the world {x i }. We can decompose the learning of a GDRF into two steps: learning the word-topic model, and learning the latent log topic probabilities. We learn the word-topic model via Gibbs sampling. This model is similar to ROST in many ways, which is itself a spatiotemporal version of LDA. In ROST, the spatio-temporal world is discretized into cells, and the prior distribution of topics in a cell is defined by the distribution of topics in the Von Neumann neighborhood of the cell. Every word in a cell has the same prior topic distribution, independent of its exact location within the cell.</p><p>For GDRFs, the Gaussian Processes underlying the model allow us to consider topic densities, as opposed to counts, in P (z|x). Normalizing n G(di) -i,j , the number of times topic j is observed in the neighborhood of cell d i , by the hypervolume V (G(d i ) of cell d i , we get an approximation for the mean topic density in the neighborhood of d i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P (z i = j|x) = n G(d i ) -i,j V (G(di) + α V (G(di) n G(d i ) -i,• V (G(di) + Kα V (G(di) (9)</formula><p>Finally, since the Dirichlet concentration parameter α can also be viewed as a smoothing "pseudocount", we can factor it into a scale times the hypervolume of the neighborhood, α → αV (G(d i )). Then, in the limit as V (G(d i )) approaches zero, we get our Gibbs sampling distribution for GDRFs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (z i = j|z -i , w, x i ) ∝ n wi -i,j + β n • -i,j + W β ρ j (x i ) + α ρ(x i ) + Kα .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Here ρ j (x) represent the density of topic j at location x, while ρ(x) represents the observation density at location x.</p><p>In GDRF, α is a pseudo-density, with the same smoothing properties as the LDA and ROST models. After sampling a topic for each observation, we have collected a set of N categorical topics {z i }, associated with N locations in the world {x i }. We can use these to do approximate variational inference on the Gaussian processes. In our generative model, we let P (z i |x) = exp(µ i )/ j exp(µ j ). P (z i |x) represents the topic probability at location x. We can use the new topics from the Gibbs sampling {z i } to calculate</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">µ z w M Σ Φ β K N K Fig. 3:</formula><p>The graphical model for GDRFs approximate ρ j (x i ) by discretizing the world.

(<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Because the softmax transformation is shift invariant, we can take C to be zero. Our training inputs are the locations of the observations {x i }, while our training targets for each Gaussian process are {log(ρ j (x i ) + α)}. We aim to maximize the sum of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for each GP using stochastic variational inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. SVI implementation was drastically simplified by using GPytorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, a GP library built on top of the Python library Pytorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, which offers simplified interfaces for automatic differentation and GPU acceleration. After a training step of the GPs, we can calculate ρ j using the same equation for the training targets.</p><p>The training procedure for GDRFs is given in algorithm 1.</p><p>Algorithm 1 GDRF Inference for i = 1 to N do 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">z i ∼ P (z i = j|z, w) 4:</formula><p>end for 5:</p><p>Update Φ according to {(w i , z i )} 6:</p><p>Update ρ j according to {(x i , z i )}</p><p>7:</p><p>for j = 1 to K do 8:</p><p>Y j = log (ρ j (x) + α)</p><p>9:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L j (X, Y ) = ELBO[G j (X), Y j ] 10:</formula><p>Update M j and Σ j according to ∇L j 11:</p><p>ρ j (x) = f j (G 1 (x), . . . , G K (x))</p><p>12:</p><p>end for 13: end while In practice, the two learned components of the GDRF model (the word-topic distributions Φ and the GPs) converge at different speeds. Empirical training accuracy and time to convergence improved when allowing the Gibbs sampler and the variational inference steps to run multiple times before proceeding. Theoretically, N i should be chosen so each half of the algorithm converges at an equal rate during each global iteration. The Gibbs sampler is hyperparameterfree, while SVI has a single additional hyperparameter: the learning rate λ. Therefore, if T 1 is the mixing time of the Gibbs sampler, and T 2 /λ is the number of SVI iterations until convergence of the GPs, N 1 /T 1 = λN 2 /T 2 . We found N 1 = 50, N 2 = 5, λ = 0.25 allowed each half of the model sufficient time to learn from the other half, without allowing either half to converge to an undesired local optimum.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulated Data</head><p>In order to demonstrate GDRF's ability to learn the latent topic structure underlying a set of observations, we tested both GDRF inference and ROST on a simulated dataset, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We drew 10,000 random observations on a 26 × 26 grid from a GDRF generative model with 4 topics, a vocabulary of size 50, a β of 0.1, zero GP mean, and a Matérn kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> of length scale = 2.5 and overall scale σ = 5. These simulation parameters were chosen because they produced maximum likelihood word distributions, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, which contain realistic spatial heterogeneity. For comparison, see fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, which contains coral reef structures.</p><p>Observations drawn from the simulation shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> were used as inputs for both the GDRF model and the ROST model. The maximum likelihood topics for both models (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>) are visually similar to the ground truth maximum likelihood topics in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. But the GDRF's inferred maxmimum likelihood topics in Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> have a much stronger resemblance to the ground truth in Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> than do ROST's in Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref> (modulo the swapping of topic labels and colors). In addition, ROST learns a factorization in which three of the four topics are always most likely, while GDRF's factorization correctly models the observations with four topics. The GDRF model also captures small scale variation (on the order of a couple of spatial cells) in the latent topic field that ROST fails to pick up. Finally, note that the inputs to both of these models are the observations, as in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, but the similarity between the ground-truth for GDRF and ROST on 10 random data sets. 7b: Topic AFMI. 7a: Word AFMI. ROST AFMI is on the X-axis, while GDRF AFMI is on the Y-axis. maximum likelihood topics in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> and the GDRF's inferred maximum likelihood topics in Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> is the product of a completely unsupervised training process.</p><p>To numerically evaluate the ability of these two models to capture complex spatial heterogeneity, we generated 10 simulation of 10,000 observations on an 11 × 11 grid, from GDRFs with 3 topics, a vocabulary of size 15, β = 0.1, M = 0, and Matérn kernels with σ = 5 and = 12.5. We trained both GDRFs and ROST on each simulation, and we computed an approximate fractional mutual information (AFMI) score between the inferred and ground truth maximum likelihood topics and words for both models:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">AFMI(M model , M gt ) = I(M model , M gt ) I(M gt , M gt )<label>(13)</label></formula><p>I(X, Y ) =</p><p>x y P (x, y) log P (x, y) P (x)P (y)</p><p>Here the marginal probabilities P (M = i) are proportional to the number of cells in the maximum likelihood map M with category i, and the joint probabilities P (M a = i, M b = j) are proportional to the number of cells with topic i in map a and topic j in map b. Note that AFMI scores range from zero to one, with zero representing two maps with no mutual information and one representing two identical maps.</p><p>The resultant AFMI scores are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. GDRF has consistently high AFMI scores for its topic maps in Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>, and slightly lower AFMI scores for its word maps Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>. In contrast, ROST has AFMI scores that vary along the entire scale for both topics and words. In both cases, GDRFs almost always get higher AFMI scores than ROST. The GDRF model is capable of learning complex, heterogeneous latent structures from densely sampled 2D categorical fields, and it learns those structures better than ROST.</p></div>

Phytoplankton Taxa Dataset</head><p>The Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO) is a research station off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, providing long time series of oceanographic and meteorological measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In addition to typical oceanographic sensors, the MVCO is equipped with an Imaging FlowCytobot <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which takes high-throughput images of phytoplankton. These images are both selectively expert-annotated, and automatically labelled using a machine learning-based classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>We used a random subset of 100,000 images from three years of MVCO phytoplankton data, from 2013 to 2016, labeled by taxon using a random forest classifier, as training inputs for GDRF and ROST. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Both GDRFs and ROST generate inferred word distributions (Figs. <ref type="figure">8c</ref> and<ref type="figure">8e</ref> ) that are visually similar to the observed distribution of phytoplankton taxa (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). But Fig <ref type="figure">8b</ref> shows GDRF produces a distribution with a lower mean KLdivergence from the observed distribution, 0.064, than ROST, 0.095. This shows GDRF learns a more accurate model for the observations than ROST.</p><p>We demonstrate GDRF's ability to extrapolate by comparing the model's performance after training with and without withheld subsets of the data. The three years of phytoplankton taxon data are divided into 500 equal-time chunks. A held-out window five chunks wide (approximately 10 days) is slid across the dataset, and the model is trained without that chunk of data. The mean KL divergence between the model and the observation distribution within this window is calculated, and fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> plots the log ratio between this windowmean divergence in the held-out and non-held-out models. On this figure, a ratio of 1 implies than both the model trained with held-out data and the model trained without held-out data predicted taxon distributions equally as far from the observed distribution (as measured using KL divergence); a ratio above 1 implies that the model trained with held-out data does worse. The mean ratio between the models is 1.07. The model trained without data in a particular region predicts a taxon distribution that is less accurate than a model trained to reproduce the observed distribution. But the magnitude of Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>: Comparison of GDRF accuracy with and without held-out data. For each data point, a roughly 10 day window of MVCO data was held out of the training data set, to produce the held-out model. The average KL divergence between the model and the ground-truth in the window was calculated. The y-axis represents the ratio between this heldout KL divergence from ground truth and the non-held-out model's average KL divergence from ground truth within the same window. Values above one imply that the non-held-out model has a smaller KL divergence from ground truth than the held-out model. topics, GDRFs are able to take advantage of the expressiveness of Gaussian process models for categorical data. We have demonstrated that GDRFs are capable of extracting meaningful structure from 2D spatial fields and interpolating on data sets with temporal gaps.</p><p>The effectiveness of GDRF inference on the MVCO phytoplankton taxon dataset demonstrates the viability of GDRFs for modeling biological systems in the ocean. We have also experimented with neural network classifiers capable of distinguishing over 140 phytoplankton taxa. Future work will explore the use of GDRFs to model 2-D and 3-D phytoplankton fields, labeled by neural network.</p><p>In this paper, we described a batch training procedure for learning GDRF models. Future work will develop techniques for doing online inference, enabling many applications such as IPP for mapping of map categorical fields autonomously.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Overview of the Gaussian-Dirichlet Random Field model.
