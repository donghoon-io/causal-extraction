<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the explanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at inference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We address these deficiencies with M&amp;Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate both fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the generalization ability of a trained M&amp;Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference and the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and multi-step critiquing.</p><p>Moreover, M&amp;Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our multimodal-based modeling and training scheme.</p></div>

However, they offer little transparency regarding their inner workings. It has been shown that providing explanations along with item recommendations enables users to understand why a particular item has been suggested and hence to make better decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, explanations increase the system's overall transparency and trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</p><p>An important advantage of explanations is that they provide a basis for feedback. If users understand what has generated the suggestions, they can refine the recommendations by interacting directly with the explanations. Critiquing is a conversational recommendation method that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Example critiquing was introduced in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and first applied to recommender systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Recognizing that critiquing is most useful when applied in multiple steps, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> introduced mechanisms based on constraint programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> with an application to travel planning. Multi-step critiquing with constraint programming was recognized as a form of preference elicitation, which enabled the analysis and optimization of its performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the addition of suggestions for active preference elicitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, which yielded dramatic improvements in decision accuracy in user studies. Multi-step critiquing was also shown to be superior to compound Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The model learns to maximize the marginal likelihood of the data 𝑝 𝜃 (𝒙) (i.e., the evidence that is intractable) by approximating the true unknown posterior 𝑝 𝜃 (𝒛|𝒙) with a variational posterior 𝑞 𝜙 (𝒛|𝒙). Applied to recommendation systems, the collaborative-filtering VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> considers as input data the sparse user preferences 𝒓 𝑢 over |𝐼 | items. More formally, the model optimizes a variational lower bound on the log likelihood of all observed user feedback 𝑢 ∈𝑈 log 𝑝 (𝒓 𝑢 ) through stochastic gradient descent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log 𝑝 (𝒓 𝑢 ) ≥ ∫ 𝒛 𝑢 𝑞 𝜙 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) log 𝑝 𝜃 (𝒓 𝑢 , 𝒛 𝑢 ) 𝑞 𝜙 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) 𝑑𝒛 𝑢 ≥ E 𝑞 𝜙 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) log 𝑝 𝜃 (𝒓 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ) -𝛽 D KL 𝑞 𝜙 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) || 𝑝 (𝒛 𝑢 ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝒛 𝑢 is sampled<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> from the distribution 𝑞 𝜙 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) with parameters 𝝁 𝑢 and 𝚺 𝑢 , and D KL [𝑞, 𝑝] denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) between the distributions 𝑝 and 𝑞. In practice, the prior 𝑝 (𝒛) is usually a spherical Gaussian with parameters 𝝁 and 𝚺. Finally, 𝛽 is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularization relative to the reconstruction error, as motivated by the 𝛽-VAE of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and is slowly annealed to 1, similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>

Then, they incorporate an additional objective to learn a projection from the critiquing feedback into the latent space via another encoder (an inverse feedback loop). In other words, they reintroduce the user's keyphrase usage 𝒌 𝑢 to approximate the variational lower bound of 𝑝 (𝒛 𝑢 ) by marginalizing over 𝒌 𝑢 . More formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">log 𝑝 (𝒛 𝑢 ) ≥ E 𝑞 (𝒌 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ) log 𝑝 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒌 𝑢 ) -D KL 𝑞(𝒌 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ) || 𝑝 (𝒌 𝑢 )<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">≈ E 𝑝 Θ 𝑘 (𝒌 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ) log 𝑝 Θ ′ 𝑘 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒌 𝑢 ) -D KL 𝑝 Θ 𝑘 (𝒌 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ) || 𝑝 (𝒌 𝑢 ) ,</formula><p>where 𝑝 (𝒌 𝑢 ) is a prior following a standard normal distribution and the weights of 𝑞(𝒌 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ) are shared with 𝑝 Θ 𝑘 (𝒌 𝑢 |𝒛 𝑢 ).</p><p>Finally, once the model is trained on the full objective function, the critiquing process for the critique 𝒄 𝑢 is performed as follows: ( Overall, the CE-VAE framework is effective in practice for recommendation, keyphrase explanation, and single-step critiquing.

Thus, there is an inherent trade-off between the performance of the recommendation and that of the explanation.</p><p>(2) Although the joint objective also maximizes a latent representation likelihood with the Kullback-Leibler terms, it is unclear whether the inverse function embeds the critique effectively and whether the mean reflects a critiquing mechanism.</p></div>

Our main goal is to learn a more generalizable representation of the user preferences.

It also allows us to apply the same technique to users who have not written reviews or to cases in which keyphrases are unavailable.

The user can accept the recommended items, at which point the session terminates. In the other case, the user can provide a critique 𝒄 𝑡 𝑢 and obtain a new recommendation r𝑡 𝑢 . The process is repeated over 𝑇 iterations until the user 𝑢 is satisfied with the recommendation. Each critique 𝒄 𝑡 𝑢 is encoded as a one-hot vector where the positive value indicates a keyphrase the user 𝑢 dislikes. The overall process is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>We leverage the generalization ability of the trained M&amp;Ms-VAE, especially the inference models 𝑞 Φ 𝑟 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) and 𝑞 Φ 𝑘 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒌 𝑢 ). We use the former to represent the initial user preferences 𝒓 𝑢 and the latter to embed the critique 𝒄 𝑡 𝑢 . However, a crucial question remains: how should we blend the user representation 𝒛 𝑢 with the 𝑡 th critique representation 𝒛 𝑡 𝑢 ? Prior work has implemented a blending function as a simple average <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> or as a linear programming task that looks for a convex combination of embeddings provided with a specific linear optimization objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. As we demonstrate empirically later, the former yields poor performance when iterated for multi-step critiquing, whereas the latter is computationally slow because the optimization is performed for each critique and it cannot leverage GPUs.</p></div>

At time step 𝑡, we express the new user preferences z𝑡 𝑢 with a linear interpolation between the original latent representation 𝒛 0 𝑢 and the critique 𝒄 𝑡 𝑢 's representation 𝒛 𝑡 𝑢 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3.2</head><p>Training. Thanks to our assumption and the generalization ability of M&amp;Ms-VAE, we can learn the weights of the blending module 𝜉 (•) by creating a synthetic dataset based only on the validation set (see Algorithm 1). For each user and observed interaction, we randomly sample a keyphrase 𝒄 that is inconsistent with the target item. Then, we calculate the item sets 𝐼 +𝒄 that contain the critique and, symmetrically, the item sets 𝐼 -𝒄 for those that do not contain it. 3   Our final objective is to re-rank items based on the user preferences and the provided critique 𝒄. Recall that M&amp;Ms-VAE's weights are frozen. Let r0 𝑢 be the user 𝑢's initial predictions r𝑢 and r1 𝑢 those inferred from z𝑡 𝑢 after the critique. We express this overall ranking-based objective via two differentiable max-margin objective functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L ( R0 , R1 , 𝑢, 𝒄, 𝐼 +𝒄 , 𝐼 -𝒄 ) = ∑︁ 𝑖 + ∈𝐼 +𝒄 max 0, ℎ -( r0 𝑢,𝑖 + -r1 𝑢,𝑖 + ) + ∑︁ 𝑖 -∈𝐼 -𝒄 max 0, ℎ -( r1 𝑢,𝑖 --r0 𝑢,𝑖 -) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where ℎ is the margin. Intuitively, 𝜉 (•) is encouraged to create a representation z𝑡 𝑢 from which 𝑝 Θ 𝑟 (•) gives a lower ranking to the items affected by the critique in the next iteration (i.e., r1 𝑢,𝑖 + &lt; r0 𝑢,𝑖 + ) and a higher ranking to the unaffected items (i.e., r1 𝑢,𝑖 -&gt; r0 𝑢,𝑖 -).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets</head><p>We evaluate the quantitative performance of M&amp;Ms-VAE using four real-world, publicly available datasets: BeerAdvocate <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Amazon CDs&amp;Vinyl <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, Yelp <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and HotelRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Each contains more than 100k reviews with five-star ratings. For the purpose of Top-N recommendation, we binarize the ratings with a threshold 𝑡 &gt; 3.5. Because people tend to rate beers and restaurants positively, we set the threshold 𝑡 &gt; 4 and 𝑡 &gt; 4.5, respectively. We split each dataset 3 In early experiments, we generalized 𝜉 (𝒛 0 𝑢 , 𝒛 𝑡 𝑢 ) to 𝜉 (𝒛 0 𝑢 , 𝒛 1 𝑢 , . . . , 𝒛 𝑡 𝑢 ) and updated Algorithm 1 accordingly. However, our synthetic dataset cannot cover such a space due to the exponential number of combinations; session-based recommenders require millions of real sessions as training data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> shows the statistics of the datasets. All contain complete observations. The datasets do not contain preselected keyphrases. Hence, we extract the keyphrases for the explanations and critiquing with the frequency-based processing of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Some examples are shown in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental Settings</head><p>Across experiments, we treat the prior and the likelihood as standard normal and multinomial distributions, respectively.</p><p>The inference and generative networks consist of a two-layer neural network with a tanh nonlinearity as the activation function between the layers. We normalize the input and use dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. For learning, we employ the Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> with AMSGrad <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and a learning rate of 5 • 10 -5 . We anneal linearly the regularization parameter 𝛽 of the Kullback-Leibler terms. For the baselines, we reused the authors' code and tuning procedure. We select hyperparameters and architectures for each model by evaluating NDCG on the validation set. We limit the search to a maximum of 100 trials. For critiquing, we tune our blending module on the synthetic dataset with the Falling MAP metric on the validation set, which measures the effect of a critique <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. For reproducibility purposes, we include additional details and the best hyperparameters in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">RQ 1:</head><p>How does M&amp;Ms-VAE perform in terms of recommendation and explanation performance?</p><p>4.3.1 Baselines. We compare our proposed M&amp;Ms-VAE model to the following baseline models. POP returns the most popular items without any kind of personalization. AutoRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is a neural autoencoder-based recommendation system. BPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is a Bayesian personalized ranking model that explicitly optimizes pairwise rankings. CDAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> denotes a collaborative denoising autoencoder that is specifically optimized for implicit feedback recommendation tasks. NCE-PLRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> represents the linear recommendation projected by noise-contrastive estimation; it augments PLRec with noise-contrasted item embeddings. PLRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is the ablation variant of NCE-PLRec without the noise-contrastive estimation. PureSVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> denotes a similarity-based recommendation method that constructs a similarity matrix through SVD decomposition of the implicit rating matrix. VAE-CF is the variational autoencoder for collaborative filtering described in Section 2.2. CE-VNCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> is the extension of the neural collaborative filtering model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that is augmented with an explanation and a critiquing neural component. Finally, CE-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is a significant improvement over CE-VNCF, and it produces state-of-the-art performance (more details in Section 2.3). For a fair comparison, we encode the user observations in M&amp;Ms-VAE using solely the inference network 𝑞 Φ 𝑟 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ) at test time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Top-N Recommendation</head><p>Performance. We report the following five metrics: R-Precision and NDCG; MAP, Precision, and Recall at different Top-N. The main results are presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. We make the following key observations. Overall, our proposed M&amp;Ms-VAE model shows the best recommendation performance for all metrics on three datasets and nearly all metrics on the CDs&amp;Vinyl dataset. Compared to the original VAE recommender (VAE-CF), M&amp;Ms-VAE achieves an improvement of 13% on average. We conjecture that the additional loss terms (i.e., 𝐸𝐿𝐵𝑂 (𝒓 𝑢 , 𝒌 𝑢 ) and Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Top-N recommendation results of all datasets. Bold and underline denote the best and second-best results, respectively. We omit the error bars because the 95% confidence interval is in 4 th digit.  𝐸𝐿𝐵𝑂 (𝒌 𝑢 )) help to generate better user representations by leveraging both the user preferences and keyphrase usage with the mixture of experts.</p></div>

We remark the same trend with CE-VNCF. These results emphasize the noise introduced in CE-VAE and CE-VNCF during training when learning the mapping between the keyphrases and the latent space. This is even more pronounced with a large number of keyphrases (i.e., over 100). In contrast, M&amp;Ms-VAE is more robust thanks to our factorization and training strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>Interestingly, PureSVD exhibits the second-best performance on the CDs&amp;Vinyl and Yelp datasets. This shows that classic algorithms often remain competitive with state-of-the-art VAE-based recommender systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Top-K Explanation</head><p>Performance. We also compare M&amp;Ms-VAE with the user and item-popularity baselines <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> that predict the explanation through counting and ranking the frequency of keyphrases for the users (symmetrically, the items) in the training set. Among the recommender baselines, only CE-VAE and CE-VNCF produce an explanation alongside the recommendation. We report the following metrics: NDCG, MAP, Precision, and Recall at different Top-K. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> contains the main results. Both popularity baselines clearly underperform, showing that the task is not trivial (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> for the number of keyphrases per dataset). Remarkably, the proposed M&amp;Ms-VAE model significantly outperforms the CE-VNCF baseline by a factor of 2.5 on average and by approximately by 3.5 on MAP and Precision. Moreover, M&amp;Ms-VAE retrieves 89% percent of relevant keyphrases within the Top-20 explanations on the CDs&amp;Vinyl dataset.</p><p>We observe that CE-VAE performs similarly to M&amp;Ms-VAE but still slightly underperforms by approximately 2% on average. Finally, we note that CE-VNCF achieves the best results in terms of Recall for the Beer dataset and Recall@5 for the CDs&amp;Vinyl and Hotel datasets. Nevertheless, as seen in the recommendation performance, CE-VNCF significantly underperforms, highlighting the trade-off between recommendation and explanation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">RQ 2:</head><p>Can M&amp;Ms-VAE with the self-supervised critiquing objective enable multi-step critiquing? 4.4.1 Baselines. UAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> denotes uniform average critiquing, in which the user embedding and all critique embeddings are averaged uniformly. BAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is balanced average critiquing. It first averages the critique embeddings and then averages them again with the initial user embedding. CE-VAE and CE-VNCF were introduced in Section 4.3.1. During training, both learn an inverse feedback loop between a critique and the latent space. At inference, they average the original user embedding with the critique embedding. LLC-Score <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and LLC-Rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> first extend the PLRec recommender system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to co-embed keyphrases into the user embedding space with a linear regression. Afterwards, the models apply a weighted average between the initial user embedding and each critique embedding; the weights are optimized in a linear programming formulation; LLC-Score uses a max-margin scoring-based objective and LLC-Rank a ranking-based objective. To limit computational complexity, the authors limit the number of constraints to the top-100 rated items. For a fair comparison, we also consider in M&amp;Ms-VAE the top-100 rated items meeting the criteria for 𝐼 +𝒄 and 𝐼 -𝒄 for each critique 𝒄, although the computational time remains identical using the full sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">User Simulation.</head><p>Similarly to prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, we conduct a user simulation to asses each model's performance in a multi-step conversational recommendation scenario. Concretely, the simulation considers all users and follows Algorithm 1 with the following differences: (1) we track the conversational interaction session of simulated users by selecting all target items from their test set, (2) the maximum allowed critiquing iterations is set to 10, and, (3) the conversation stops if the target item appears within the top-N recommendations on that iteration.</p><p>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we simulate a variety of user-critiquing styles. For each, the candidate keyphrases to critique are inconsistent (i.e., disjoint) with the target item's known keyphrase list. We experiment with the following three methodologies:</p><p>(1) Random: we assume the user randomly chooses a keyphrase to critique.</p><p>(2) Pop: we assume the user selects a keyphrase to critique according to the general keyphrase popularity.</p><p>(3) Diff: we assume the user critiques a keyphrase that deviates the most from the known target item description.</p><p>To do so, we compare the top recommended items' keyphrase frequency to the target item's keyphrases and select the keyphrase with the largest frequency differential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Multi-</head><p>Step Critiquing Performance. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, we asses the models over all users and all items on the test set using two metrics: the average success rate and session length. The former is the percentage of target items that successfully reach a rank within the Top-N, and the latter is the average length of these sessions (with a limit of 10 iterations). In our experiment framework, for each user and target item, we sample alongside 299 unseen items.</p><p>The results for each dataset and each keyphrase critiquing selection method are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Overall, all models' performance is generally better on the Beer and CDs&amp;Vinyl datasets due to the higher density in terms of the number of interactions. Generally, all models tend to find the target item within the Top-20 in more than half the time and under six turns. This highlights that in practice, users are likely to find the desired item in a limited amount of time.</p><p>Impressively, M&amp;Ms-VAE clearly outperforms all the baselines on both metrics on the Beer, CDs&amp;Vinyl, and Yelp datasets. On the Hotel dataset, the success rate is significantly higher for the Random and Pop cases and similar for the Diff case, whereas the session length is higher for the Pop and Diff selection methods. This is unsurprising, because the blending module is trained only once on the random keyphrase critiquing selection (i.e., no assumption on the user's behavior).</p><p>Although the simple self-supervision objective in M&amp;Ms-VAE mimics only one-step random critiquing, we remark that the training strategy generalizes for multi-step critiquing and other keyphrase critiquing selection as well.

However, they are outperformed by LLC-Score, LLC-Rank, and M&amp;Ms-VAE. These results confirm our observation in Section 2.3 that the critiquing objective introduces noise during training and does not accurately reflect the critiquing mechanism.    significantly underperform on both metrics in 10 out of 12 cases. This highlights the effectiveness of our proposed critiquing algorithm compared to linear aggregation methods.</p><p>4.5 RQ 3: What is the critiquing computational time complexity for M&amp;Ms-VAE compared to prior work?</p><p>Now, we aim to empirically determine how the critiquing in M&amp;Ms-VAE compares to the best baselines in Section 4.4, LLC-Score and LLC-Rank, in terms of computational time. Because the baselines can not leverage the GPU due to their optimization framework, we also run M&amp;Ms-VAE on the CPU. We follow the same experiment settings as in Section 4.4</p><p>and limit ourselves to 1,000 users and the Random keyphrase critiquing selection method. All models process exactly 10 critiques for each user-item pair. We employ a machine with a 2.5GHz 24-core CPU, Titan X GPU, and 256GB memory.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> shows the average computational time over 10 runs. Particularly, the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref> denotes the critiquing computational time in milliseconds, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref> the overall simulation time in minutes. Impressively, we observe that the critiquing in M&amp;Ms-VAE's is approximately 7.5x faster on CPU and up to 25.6x on the GPU than LLC-Score and LLC-Rank. This shows that once the critiquing module of M&amp;Ms-VAE is trained, which takes less than five minutes on the machine, the model achieves a lower latency (batch size of one). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>, the overall simulation in M&amp;Ms-VAE is at least 3.1x faster on CPU and approximately 5.3x faster on GPU. Finally, in real-life applications, we could leverage multiple users' critiques simultaneously and increase the throughput by considering a larger batch size. is consistent across the other metrics). On the full datasets, we note that the explanation performance is comparable across the three variants and higher than those of the baselines in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Regarding the recommendation performance, M&amp;Ms-VAE r 𝑢 obtains the best results, followed closely by M&amp;Ms-VAE r 𝑢 , k 𝑢 , and M&amp;Ms-VAE k 𝑢 clearly underperforms.</p><p>This aligns with the observations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>: recommender systems are limited if they use only review text as input, and not all reviews can be useful. Nevertheless, compared to Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, M&amp;Ms-VAE k 𝑢 always achieves better recommendation performance than the popularity baseline, and it performs better than AutoRec and CDAE on two datasets.</p><p>The bottom row of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> show the relative drop in performance on both metrics. The explanation performance seems unaffected by the sparsity, showing that the explanation task remains simple in comparison with the recommendation task. Remarkably, with only 50% fully observed inputs and the rest partially observed, the recommendation performance of M&amp;Ms-VAE r 𝑢 and M&amp;Ms-VAE r 𝑢 , k 𝑢 is decreased by only 9% on average. More so, with 90% partial observations, the model can still achieve more than 70% of its performance quality on the full datasets. Finally, these results emphasize that M&amp;Ms-VAE can effectively learn the joint distribution even in a weakly supervised setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>Recommendations can have much more impact if they are supported by explanations that can be critiqued. Previous research has developed methods that either perform poorly in multi-step critiquing or suffer from computational inefficiency at inference. In this paper, we presented M&amp;Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for recommendation and explanation that treats the user preference and keyphrase usage as different observed variables. Additionally, we proposed a strategy that mimics weakly supervised learning and trains the inference networks jointly and independently.</p><p>Our second contribution is a new critiquing module that leverages the generalizability of M&amp;Ms-VAE to embed the user preference and the critique. With a self-supervised objective and a synthetic dataset, we enable multi-step critiquing in M&amp;Ms-VAE. Experiments on four datasets show that M&amp;Ms-VAE ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is the first model to obtain substantially better recommendation, explanation, and multi-critiquing performance, (2) processes critiques up to 25.6x faster than previous state-of-the-art methods, and (3) produces coherent joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision.</p><p>A  </p></div>

We denote three cases at test time: (1) only the user's interactions are used, and the encoder is 𝑞 Φ 𝑟 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 ); (2) only the user's keyphrase preference is used, and the encoder is 𝑞 Φ 𝑘 (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒌 𝑢 ); and (3) both used with the encoder 𝑞 Φ (𝒛 𝑢 |𝒓 𝑢 , 𝒌 𝑢 ). Second, we simulate incomplete supervision by randomly selecting a subset of the training with fully observed samples. The other one is split into two even parts: the first includes only observed 𝒓 𝑢 and the second 𝒌 𝑢 . We retain the models and settings of Section 4.3.

When the evaluation is conducted on 300 items (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), we see that users indeed find a specific item using our technique with a high success rate (i.e., around 90%). However, in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> where thousands of items are available, the results</p><p>show that current methods are not yet good enough to achieve similar results for such a large number. Nevertheless, M&amp;Ms-VAE clearly outperforms on average other methods and still achieves an average success rate of 30%. </p></div>			</div>
