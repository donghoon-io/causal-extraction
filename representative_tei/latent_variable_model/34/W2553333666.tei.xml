<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>If something characterizes the business environment in recent years has been the acute suffering economic crisis, which cannot be attributed merely to a change in the economic cycle but also to the absence of values and ethical principles in the functioning of organizations <ref type="bibr">(Melé, Argandoña, Runde &amp; Sánchez, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, a solution for this crisis may be from social innovations <ref type="bibr">(Goldsmith, 2010)</ref> and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is considered an innovation in business management and as such can reach their full strategic value and even there are organizations which believe that CSR protects against the negative effects of the economic crisis <ref type="bibr">(Janssen, Sen &amp; Bhattacharya, 2015)</ref>. In this context, the classic study of CSR have expanded the scope of the economic crisis <ref type="bibr">(Pérez &amp; del Bosque, 2012)</ref> and their effective management can help organizations minimize the negative impacts of the recession.</p><p>Moreover, organizations are constantly adapting to economic changes with the intention to have a better chance of survival in the market. A key factor for this is innovation <ref type="bibr">(Bernardo, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Damanpour and Gopalakrishnan (2001)</ref> define it as "the adoption of an idea or a new behavior in the organization". CSR contributes to and encourages innovation in three ways:</p><p>• innovation resulting from dialogue with various stakeholders both internal and external to the company,</p><p>• identifying new business opportunities arising from social demands and environmental products and more efficient processes or new forms of business aimed at the socalled base of the pyramid, formed by people with less resources <ref type="bibr">(Prahalad &amp; Ramaswamy, 2004</ref>) and</p><p>• creating better places and ways of working that encourage innovation and creativity, such as those based on greater employee participation and confidence in them <ref type="bibr">(Benito Hernandez &amp; Esteban Sanchez, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, companies should adopt formalized CSR practices and thus establish the procedures and tools that are aligned with their corporate strategy <ref type="bibr">(Bocquet, Le Bas, Mothe &amp; Poussing, 2013)</ref>. So much so that there are studies that suggest that CSR has a significant positive contribution to national competitiveness and even levels of quality of life <ref type="bibr">(Boulouta &amp; Pitelis, 2014)</ref>. In other words, it is expected that innovation will increase when the company is responsible and that increased innovation translates into greater competitive success, enhancing the effect itself already exercised CSR in the competitiveness of the company <ref type="bibr">(Vázquez &amp; Sánchez, 2013)</ref>. As suggest <ref type="bibr">Vilanova, Lozano and Arenas (2009)</ref> whether CSR is integrated into business processes generates innovative practices and therefore improved competitiveness and further this integration can be facilitated by standardized management processes previously implanted.</p><p>CSR has become an increasingly important factor for competitiveness perceived by enterprises <ref type="bibr">(Turyakira, Venter &amp; Smith, 2014)</ref>. Competitiveness is a multidimensional concept that refers how create sustainable competitive advantage which can be used both nationally, and at the companies level <ref type="bibr">(Vilanova et al., 2009)</ref>. Hence, the effect of CSR on competitive success (obtaining positive results for the company in terms of market positioning and ranging beyond the financial sphere) <ref type="bibr">(Vázquez &amp; Sánchez, 2013</ref>) is higher in sectors with high competitiveness (such as the technology sector)and following a proactive (versus reactive) strategy <ref type="bibr">(Marín Rubio &amp; De Maya, 2012)</ref>, in which CSR is a competitive advantage, while it is lower in uncompetitive sectors, where companies continue traditionally differentiating offering advantages brand, price, quality and distribution <ref type="bibr">(Rives &amp; Bañón, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, there is a growing number of Spanish companies that believe they should contribute to sustainable development through the planning operations in order to promote economic growth and increasing its productivity and competitiveness while ensuring the protection of the environment and promoting social responsibility, and thus fulfilling the general interests (Prado-Lorenzo, Gallego-Álvarez, <ref type="bibr">García-Sánchez &amp; Rodriguez-Dominguez, 2008)</ref> of the society, since investment in CSR initiatives can be a source of competitive advantage <ref type="bibr">(Apospori, Zografos &amp; Magrizos, 2012)</ref> and a way to improve the economic performance of companies <ref type="bibr">(Hur, Kim &amp; Woo, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Being aware of these conditions, the aims of this article are:</p><p>• investigating the motivations of technology companies for taking part in CSR initiatives and implement policies and activities within it -CSR practices that create innovations in processes <ref type="bibr">(Benito Hernandez &amp; Esteban Sanchez, 2012)</ref> -integrating them into the management system itself of any organization and</p><p>• analyzing the enabling factors of implementation and integration of CSR within the organization and</p><p>• the direct influence of the integration of CSR in the competitiveness of the technological company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Review of the literature</head><p>Academically, CSR is often used as a comprehensive term to describe a variety of issues relating to the responsibilities of business <ref type="bibr">(Hillenbrand, Money &amp; Ghobadian, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Waddock (2004)</ref>, for example, defines CSR as defines CR as "the degree of (ir)responsibility manifested in a company's strategies and operating practices as they impact stakeholders and the natural environment day-to-day". However, there is no universally accepted definition of CSR <ref type="bibr">(Dahlsrud, 2008)</ref>, although it can be stated that CSR CSR is not only about strict compliance of existing legal obligations, but also voluntary integration in the governance and management, strategy, policies and procedures, social, labour-related and environmental concerns and respect for human rights arising from the relationship and transparent dialogue with its stakeholders, and taking responsibility for the consequences and impacts resulting from the actions of an organization <ref type="bibr">(Mendoza, De Nieves &amp; Briones, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, much of the literature on CSR has focused on the impact of CSR on the level of enterprises competitiveness <ref type="bibr">(Boulouta &amp; Pitelis, 2014)</ref>, for both large and small firms and in different sectors <ref type="bibr">(Battaglia, Testa, Bianchi, Iraldo &amp; Frey, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vidales &amp; Ortiz, 2014)</ref>. Nonetheless, any studies had been founded on technology companies competitiveness, so in the following sections a review will take place and the hypothesis of this article will be proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">CSR and Spanish technology sector</head><p>In the scientific literature there are an important number of studies on CSR both in large companies <ref type="bibr">(Melé, Debeljuh &amp; Arruda, 2006)</ref>, and small ones (eg. Baumann-Pauly, Wickert, <ref type="bibr">Spence &amp; Scherer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vázquez-Carrasco &amp; López-Pérez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Herrera, Larrán &amp; Martínez-Martínez, 2013)</ref> in different sectors eg. financial <ref type="bibr">(Pérez Ruiz &amp; Rodriguez del Bosque, 2012)</ref> and Banks <ref type="bibr">(Alcaraz &amp; Rodenas, 2013)</ref>.; <ref type="bibr">Martínez-Campillo, Head-García &amp; Marbella-Sánchez, 2013)</ref>, energy <ref type="bibr">(Moseñe, Burritt, Sanagustín, Moneva &amp; Tingey-Holyoak, 2013)</ref> and Public Administration <ref type="bibr">(Bernal Conesa, De Nieves Nieto &amp; Briones Peñalver, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">García-Sanchez Frias-Aceituno &amp; Rodriguez-Dominguez, 2013)</ref> and even one that refers to technology companies (Guadamillas-Gómez, Donate-Manzanares &amp; Skerlavaj, 2010); the possible motivations to adopt CSR (Prado- <ref type="bibr">Lorenzo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Graafland &amp; Schouten, 2012)</ref>, and its integration with other management systems in the company <ref type="bibr">(Bernardo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Von Ahsen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Castka &amp; Balzarova, 2008)</ref>. However, no studies have been found on CSR, their motivations and integration technology companies, which are a constant source of innovation, not only in processes but also products. Therefore, information about technology sector is scarce because the motivations of CSR and its integration have not been sufficiently studied. Thus, it is estimated interesting depth study of it in Spanish technology companies, since previous research has shown that organizations with a strategic focus on innovation committed to improve their internal organizational capacities to become more competitive in a global environment <ref type="bibr">(Suñe, Bravo, Mundet &amp; Herrera, 2012)</ref>. In fact to promote product and process innovations, companies must adopt formalized CSR practices as this has a positive contribution to the competitiveness <ref type="bibr">(Boulouta &amp; Pitelis, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Four remarkable ways established in the scientific literature whereby CSR can create competitive advantages <ref type="bibr">(Hockerts, 2015)</ref>. These are:</p><p>• risk reduction,</p><p>• the efficiency gains,</p><p>• social reputation and</p><p>• the creation of new markets.</p><p>Several authors <ref type="bibr">(Perrini, Russo &amp; Tencati, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Spence, 2007)</ref> have identified the sector as one of the elements affecting the organizational culture in adopting and integrating CSR practices in the strategic plans of organizations. For example, <ref type="bibr">Perrini et al. (2007)</ref> found that companies in the sector of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) were more likely to monitor and report on the behaviour of their CSR, while manufacturing firms were more interested in motivating employees through voluntary activities in the community.</p><p>A study developed by <ref type="bibr">Lorenzo, Sánchez and Álvarez (2009)</ref> states that the fact of belonging to the technology and telecommunications sector has a positive but not significant effect in the dissemination of CSR actions.</p><p>In certain technology sectors product development periods are extremely long and businesses often have negative results during the first years of life, put forward higher financing difficulties. In these cases, the financial indicators are not effective in assessing the potential of companies, being more appropriate intangible assets and knowledge -based (Quintana <ref type="bibr">García, Benavides Velasco, &amp; Guzman Parra, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Among these intangible assets we can find the CSR <ref type="bibr">(Lindgreen, Antioco, Palmer &amp; Heesch, 2009)</ref> which, as some studies have shown, has a positive relationship with the financial benefits <ref type="bibr">(Hammann, Habisch &amp; Pechlaner, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the activity of a company has a high social impact when it operates in ICT <ref type="bibr">(Luna Sotorrío &amp; Fernández Sánchez, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>That is why we will investigate and analyze the situation of the Spanish technology companies against CSR, taking as a starting point located in Spanish Scientific and Technological Parks because in them there is a greater presence of high-tech companies (Vásquez-Urriago, <ref type="bibr">Barge-Gil &amp; Rico, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Companies located in technology parks show a greater effort in innovation (Vásquez-Urriago, <ref type="bibr">Barge-Gil, Rico &amp; Paraskevopoulou, 2014)</ref> and a significantly higher level of cooperation shown in the case of these companies <ref type="bibr">(Vásquez-Urriago et al., 2012)</ref>. "Science park" concept was originated in the late 1950s in the American university context <ref type="bibr">(Jimenez-Zarco, Cerdan-Chiscano &amp; Torrent-Sellens, 2013)</ref>. The success of technology parks such as Silicon Valley in California and Cambridge in the UK has influenced to replicate the model in other countries <ref type="bibr">(Ratinho &amp; Henriques, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In Spain, first parks emerged in the mid-1980s, following a strategy of attracting high -tech companies <ref type="bibr">(Jimenez-Zarco et al., 2013)</ref> with the aim of contributing to economic and business growth at the local or regional level.</p><p>In 1988 the Spanish Science and Technology Parks Association (APTE) was created with the goal of making science and technology in key parts of Spanish innovation parks system. APTE takes care of contacting the scientific world inside and outside the parks with the business parks for the creation and transfer of knowledge, by setting regional innovation systems <ref type="bibr">(Jimenez-Zarco et al., 2013)</ref> that is why Spain is an interesting case in science parks unlike other established in the United States or United Kingdom <ref type="bibr">(Vásquez-Urriago et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Currently there are 68 science and technology parks associated to APTE and welcome them home businesses, nature and different interests: academic spin-offs Technological Base (EBT), Knowledge Based Companies (EBC) and start-ups <ref type="bibr">(Jimenez-Zarco et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albahari, Catalano and Landoni (2013)</ref> show how some parks contribute significantly to regional development, economic and social terms, since they favor the development of a specialized and innovative industry, and create the seed for the creation of an industrial cluster.</p><p>Technology parks have in common the creation of technology companies and attract companies already established in order to promote regional development through a technological approach and the creation of employment and welfare <ref type="bibr">(Ratinho &amp; Henriques, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jimenez-Zarco et al., 2013)</ref>, so the technology parks would be directly related to two of the three dimensions of CSR (economic and social) and generate a network of cooperation between technology companies, which can increase the capacity of general knowledge and positively expand relations with own agents of business, if we add the adoption of CSR policies, will allow greater flexibility and opportunities to address social problems with innovative products or services, increasing the ability to attract, retain and motivate staff and access to new knowledge and information, so companies could increase their performance and competitiveness <ref type="bibr">(Benito Hernandez &amp; Esteban Sanchez, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Being located in a technology park has positive effects on product innovation and increases the odds of being innovative between 10% and 20%, and increases sales due to new products about 32% <ref type="bibr">(Vásquez-Urriago et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, companies located in parks are smaller on average, have higher export orientation, belong to a group of companies more often, are larger share of ups and have less frequent decrease in turnover by sale or closure of the company <ref type="bibr">(Vásquez-Urriago et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Motivations of CSR and integration</head><p>Despite the difficulty of providing a definition of CSR <ref type="bibr">(Dahlsrud, 2008)</ref>, general idea extracted from all of them is that CSR means that companies must conduct the business by way of proving consideration to a wider social environment with the purpose of serving constructively the society needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Motivations for the implementation of CSR</head><p>The motivations for the implementation of CSR have been studied generally <ref type="bibr">(Graafland &amp; Schouten, 2012)</ref> in different countries <ref type="bibr">(Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prajogo, Tang &amp; Lai, 2012)</ref> and sectors, finding two different types of primary motivations: external or extrinsic to the organization, where the financial or economic nature to can be pointed in its relation benefit <ref type="bibr">(Graafland &amp; Schouten, 2012)</ref> and internal or intrinsic to the organization, which not only have to do with benefit of the organization but also with the staff values and beliefs that belong to organizations <ref type="bibr">(Graafland &amp; Schouten, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Integration of CSR in the organization</head><p>Referring to the integration of CSR in business literature reveals that very few companies have it integrated effectively <ref type="bibr">(Bernardo, Casadesus, Karapetrovic &amp; Heras, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karapetrovic &amp; Casadesús, 2009)</ref>, despite the benefits of such integration <ref type="bibr">(Bernardo, Simon, Tarí &amp; Molina-Azorín, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Simon, Karapetrovic &amp; Casadesús, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study is based on the existence of different motivations for CSR, but also trying to detect which are these for technology companies, if there are "enablers" for their integration and if through this integration of CSR could contribute significantly to the competitiveness of the company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual model and hypotheses</head><p>Based on the previous sections and analyzing the previous work cited therein concerning the existence of different motivations to adopt a CSR strategy in companies and their influence on it, this section try to focus which are these motivations for CSR in Spanish technology companies and once they have H3: The CSR integration into the company will be affected directly and positively by the ease of implementation of CSR measures. H4: The CSR integration in the strategy of the organization has a positive influence on the competitiveness of the technology company.</p><p>These assumptions are summarized in the conceptual model reflected in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methodology</head><p>There are a variety of methods for aggregating existing data in the social sciences (Rodríguez Gutiérrez, Fuentes <ref type="bibr">García &amp; Sanchez Canizares, 2013)</ref>. However, these are not generally applied in the field of CSR research. One of the most widely used methods is the factorial analysis, based mainly in works whose study is based on surveys <ref type="bibr">(Rodríguez Gutiérrez et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>To collect data, a total of 489 invitations were sent by email to access a direct link to the questionnaire.</p><p>Finally, 98 companies completed the questionnaire, representing a response rate of 20, 04%. In the case of surveys using web tools including a link to access the survey, the response rate is around 30% <ref type="bibr">(Arevalo, Aravind, Ayuso &amp; Roca, 2013)</ref> although there are empirical studies with a rate of valid response between 10% and 20% <ref type="bibr">(Ramos, Manzanares &amp; Gomez, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chow &amp; Chen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Homburg &amp; Stebel, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>For this study a specific questionnaire was designed, using the Likert scale 1-5 (1 "strongly disagree" and 5 "strongly agree"), because a large number of questions refer to issues that cannot be quantified with a specific value (e.g. implement CSR measures to increase employee motivation). Overall, the questionnaire included questions about the motivations of CSR implementation, integration with other management systems, ease of integration, adopting a CSR strategy and stakeholder for the organization, in line with other studies <ref type="bibr">(Vázquez &amp; Sánchez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prajogo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Godos Díez, Fernandez Gago, Head &amp; García, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Law &amp; Gunasekaran, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Díez &amp; Gago, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To carry out the analysis, a structural equation model (SEM) has been used. The structural equation models are statistical procedures that allow to measure the functional hypothesis, predictive and causal, these being essential multivariate statistical tools for understanding many elements of research and conduct basic or applied research in the behavioral sciences, management, health and social <ref type="bibr">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In structural equation modeling as Vasquez and Sanchez (2013) suggest, more complex relationships (with direct and indirect effects) while working with latent variables (not directly observable and must be measured by indicators) are assumed. This is the difference with classical multivariate regression models.</p><p>For the constructs formation has been used the following indicators, based on the literature <ref type="bibr">(Battaglia et al, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gallardo-Vazquez &amp; Sanchez-Hernandez, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turyakira et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Asif, Searcy, Zutshi &amp; Fisscher, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Asif, Searcy, Zutshi &amp; Ahmad, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee, Park &amp; Lee, 2013)</ref>  The structural equation models include two levels of analysis (the measurement model and the structural model) <ref type="bibr">(Hair Jr., Sarstedt, Hopkins &amp; Kuppelwieser, 2014)</ref>. Measurement model determines the relationships between the latent variables (constructs) and their indicators. Structural model examines the relationship between constructs <ref type="bibr">(Chen &amp; Chang, 2011)</ref>, which includes determining whether the structural relationships are significant and meaningful, and testing hypotheses. Sum up, structural model is similar to performing a regression but with explanatory power <ref type="bibr">(Vázquez &amp; Sánchez, 2013)</ref> analysis, studying the direct and indirect effects set of constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Statistical analysis</head><p>The technique chosen within SEM is known as Partial Least Squares (PLS), for different reasons because:</p><p>• PLS-SEM has been broadly used in prior IT research <ref type="bibr">(Wang, Chen &amp; Benitez-Amado, 2015</ref> technology; <ref type="bibr">Chen &amp; Chang, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pavlou &amp; El Sawy, 2006)</ref>;</p><p>• the use of PLS is recommended when the theoretical knowledge of a topic is scarce <ref type="bibr">(Hair Jr. et al., 2014)</ref> as is the case (RSC and technology companies) and also PLS-SEM is more appropriate for causal applications and theory buildings <ref type="bibr">(Roldán &amp; Sánchez-Franco, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henseler et al., 2014)</ref> although it can also be used for confirming all these theories (confirmatory analysis) through the goodness of fit of the global structural model <ref type="bibr">(Dijkstra &amp; Henseler, 2015)</ref>,</p><p>• PLS can estimate models with reflective and formative indicators without problem of identification <ref type="bibr">(Vinzi, Chin, Henseler &amp; Wang, 2010)</ref> because PLS path modeling works with weighted composites rather than factors <ref type="bibr">(Gefen, Rigdon &amp; Straub, 2011)</ref>;</p><p>• PLS can be estimated models with small samples, in fact, the PLS modeling algorithms tend to get results with high levels of statistical power <ref type="bibr">(Reinartz, Haenlein &amp; Henseler, 2009)</ref>, even when the sample size is very modest <ref type="bibr">(Rigdon, 2014)</ref>. Thus, and following Henseler et al.</p><p>(2014) used PLS as a remarkable statistical tool for management and research organizations.</p><p>The software used was SmartPLS 2.0 M3, developed by Ringle, Wende and Will in 2005. Since</p><p>SmartPLS is an estimation model and SEM analysis, uses the estimation process in two steps, evaluating the model measurement and structural model <ref type="bibr">(Hair Jr. et al., 2014)</ref>. First, the measurement model where the relationship between the indicators and the construct is determined <ref type="bibr">(Roldán &amp; Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. Secondly, the estimation of the structural model, where relationships are evaluated between different constructs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In the present study, the aim has been to examine the motivations of implementing CSR in technology companies, its implementation and integration and its effect on the competitiveness of these enterprises through the application of a predictive model and an analysis statistical since the study the role of technology companies in environmental management, sustainability and CSR is still in its early stages initial <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Through the study, it is intended to cover the detected gap on the motivations in technology companies to implement CSR measures, because although there are previous studies of motivations for CSR, integration and results in Spanish companies, such as made from a regional point of view (Gallardo- <ref type="bibr">Vázquez &amp; Sanchez-Hernandez, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vintró, Fortuny, Sanmiquel, Freijo &amp; Edo, 2012)</ref> or by analyzing a single aspect of that relationship (Prado- <ref type="bibr">Lorenzo et al., 2008)</ref>. Thus, the absence of previous empirical studies to analyze the motivations of CSR in the technology sector in Spain, its integration into the company and its impact on competitiveness, justified his conduct and considered coming to add an investigator supplement to studies linking CSR and its integration into business, because this relationship is not studied with a direct effect only, but found out an indirect relationship through of previous management systems as variable partial mediation on competitiveness.</p><p>This study proposes a model that explains the measures CSR in technology companies and its influence on the competitiveness of these companies. The model reveals that the construct (Integration of CSR) has one significant influence on competitiveness. To demonstrate this latter have raised a number of hypotheses through constructs or latent variables, which are not directly observable and have assumed that relations between them are complex. The model has been estimated by SEM technique has been tested using a sample of Spanish technology companies.</p><p>The results show that the motivations (in this case, external), management systems previously adopted by enterprises and the implementation of means of CSR are interrelated, so that the previous management systems and the implementation of measures CSR mediate significantly on the effect of real integration of CSR in the organization and this in turn has a direct effect on competitiveness perceived. Consequently, the results have implications both theoretical and practical. Despite the contributions of this study, it also has some limitations. First, while the fact that the sample is restricted to companies in Spain could be seen as a lack of generalizability of the results, it is also true that our results are consistent with the literature and the results of previous studies from no Spanish samples (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Turyakira et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hur et al., 2014)</ref> which clearly supports the validity of our results beyond the Spanish borders. In addition, this study has an associative modeling approach, since it will be directed towards the prediction of causality. While causality ensures the ability to control events, the association (prediction) only allows a limited degree of control <ref type="bibr">(Falk &amp; Miller, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, another limitation is determined by the technique used for the proposed model: structural equation, which assumes a linearity of the relationship between the latent variables <ref type="bibr">(Castro &amp; Roldan, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Thirdly, technology companies are dynamic organizations that change over time. Consequently, future research should measure the constructs analyzed over several time periods, taking into account the dynamics to configure the different dimensions of CSR.</p><p>However, given the limitations noted above, the work has to be seen as a pioneer, as it represents a starting point for aspects of CSR in any technology company and covers the gap detected in the literature. Therefore, as future research is proposed to test a structural model to analyze the causal relationship between the orientation of technological companies towards CSR and performance economic. The results of this model indicate whether the CSR strategy, or to a significant extent, explain the competitive success and its relationship to performance. If so, it would be an interesting strategy for technology companies that develop determine:</p><p>• the strategic intent of CSR;</p><p>• participate in CSR for a specific benefit;</p><p>• addressing CSR as an investment in intangible assets;</p><p>• focus on a specific category of stakeholders (e.g. customers, employees, suppliers, etc.);</p><p>• to decide how to communicate CSR initiatives; and</p><p>• design and manage the process of decision making of CSR.</p></div>

Un factor clave para ello es la innovación <ref type="bibr">(Bernardo, 2014)</ref>.

Dicha validez discriminante se analiza mediante dos métodos <ref type="bibr">(Gefen &amp; Straub, 2005)</ref>. Por un lado, un método para evaluar la existencia de validez discriminante es el criterio de Fornell y Larcker <ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref>. Este método establece que el constructo deber estar formado con más varianza de sus indicadores que cualquier otro constructo. Para corroborar este requisito, la raíz cuadrada de la AVE de cada constructo debe ser mayor que sus correlaciones con cualquier otro constructo. Esta condición se cumple para todos los constructos en relación con sus otras variables (ver Tabla 3). La segunda opción para la verificación de la validez discriminante, se realiza examinando las cargas transversales de los indicadores. Este método es considerado a menudo menos restrictivo que el anterior <ref type="bibr">(Henseler, Ringle &amp; Sinkovics, 2009)</ref> </p></div>

Estos valores, según <ref type="bibr">Chin (1998)</ref>  En segundo lugar, se analiza la varianza explicada.

A pesar de que la hipótesis H1 confirma que existen motivaciones para implantar la RSC en empresas tecnológicas están son sólo de tipo externo no existiendo de tipo interno como sugieren Graafland y Schouten (2012).

Esta circunstancia está aparentemente vinculada con el hecho de que el tamaño más habitual de las empresas analizadas son micro y pequeñas empresas pues los indicadores que no figuran entre los validados son aquellos relacionados con los trabajadores.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusiones</head><p>En el presente estudio, el objetivo ha sido examinar las motivaciones de implantar RSC en empresas tecnológicas, su implantación e integración y su efecto en la competitividad de dichas empresas a través de la aplicación de un modelo predictivo y un análisis estadístico, pues, el estudio del papel de las empresas tecnológicas en la gestión ambiental, la sostenibilidad y en la RSC está aún en sus etapas iníciales <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>A través del estudio realizado, se pretende cubrir el vacío detectado sobre las motivaciones en empresas tecnológicas para la implantación de medidas de RSC, ya que si bien existen estudios previos sobre motivaciones para la RSC, su integración y los resultados en empresas españolas, estos lo hacen desde un punto de vista regional <ref type="bibr">(Gallardo-Vázquez &amp; Sanchez-Hernandez, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vintró, Fortuny, Sanmiquel, Freijo &amp; Edo, 2012)</ref> o analizando un único aspecto de dicha relación <ref type="bibr">(Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2008)</ref>. Así pues, la ausencia de trabajos empíricos previos que analicen las motivaciones de la RSC en el sector de la tecnología en España, su integración en la empresa y su efecto sobre la competitividad, justificó su realización y se considera que viene a añadir un suplemento investigador a los estudios que relacionan la RSC y su integración en las empresas, pues dicha relación no se estudia con un efecto directo únicamente, sino que se ha encontrado una relación indirecta a través de los sistemas de gestión previos como variable de mediación parcial sobre la competitividad.</p><p>Este estudio propone un modelo que explica las medidas de RSC en empresas tecnologías y su influencia en la competitividad de dichas empresas. El modelo revela que el constructo (Integración de la RSC) tiene una influencia significativa en la competitividad. Para demostrar esto último se han planteado una serie de hipótesis a través de constructos o variables latentes, las cuales no son directamente observables y se han asumido que las relaciones entre ellas son complejas. El modelo ha siso estimado mediante la técnica SEM y ha sido probado usando una muestra de empresas tecnologías españolas.</p><p>Los resultados obtenidos muestran que las motivaciones (en este caso, externas), los sistemas de gestión previamente adoptados por las empresas y la implantación de medias de RSC están relacionados entre sí, de tal manera que los sistemas de gestión previos y la implantación de medidas de RSC median significativamente en el efecto de la integración real de la RSC en la organización y esta a su vez tiene un efecto directo sobre la competitividad percibida. En consecuencia, los resultados tienen implicaciones tanto teóricas como prácticas.</p><p>Así, la validación del modelo podrá ayudar a emprendedores tecnológicos y directivos a entender porqué deberían prestar atención a las cuestiones de RSC y qué se espera de los esfuerzos que realizan hacia el desarrollo medioambiental y social de su organización, más allá del puro desarrollo económico.</p><p>Desde un punto de vista práctico las empresas tecnológicas pueden utilizar los resultados de este estudio como un punto de apoyo para potenciar la integración de la RSC en su estrategia corporativa a través de medidas concretas de RSC como la formación de sus trabajadores, el conocimiento sostenible y la comunicación con los stakeholders entre otros y aprovechar las sinergias en la gestión creadas entre los sistemas de gestión normalizados y la RSC, pues la integración de la RSC en empresas tecnológicas, como ha quedado demostrado, tiene una relación directa con la competitividad en línea con otros estudios <ref type="bibr">(De Vries, Terwel, Ellemers &amp; Daamen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gallardo-Vázquez &amp; Sanchez-Hernandez, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Swanson &amp; Zhang, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A pesar de las aportaciones de este trabajo, también tiene algunas limitaciones. En primer lugar, mientras que el hecho de que la muestra se restringe a empresas en España podría ser visto como una falta de generalización de los resultados, también es cierto que nuestros resultados son consistentes con la literatura y los resultados de estudios anteriores extraídos de muestras no españolas (por ejemplo <ref type="bibr">Turyakira et al., 2014 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hur et al., 2014)</ref>, que apoya claramente la validez de nuestros resultados más allá de las fronteras españolas. Además, el presente estudio tiene un enfoque de modelado asociativo, puesto que va dirigido más hacia la predicción de la causalidad. Mientras que la causalidad garantiza la capacidad de controlar los eventos, la asociación (predicción) sólo permite un grado limitado de control <ref type="bibr">(Falk &amp; Miller, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>En segundo lugar, otra limitación se encuentra determinada por la técnica utilizada para el modelo propuesto: ecuaciones estructurales, que asume una linealidad de las relaciones entre las variables latentes <ref type="bibr">(Castro &amp; Roldán, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>En tercer lugar, las empresas tecnológicas son organizaciones dinámicas que cambian con el tiempo. En consecuencia, la investigación futura de las mismas debería medir los constructos analizados a lo largo de varios periodos de tiempo, teniendo en cuenta la dinámica para configurar las diferentes dimensiones de la RSC.</p><p>Sin embargo, dadas las limitaciones indicadas anteriormente, el trabajo tiene que ser visto como pionero, ya que representa un punto de partida para los aspectos de la RSC en cualquier empresa tecnológica y cubre el hueco detectado en la literatura. Por tanto, como futuras líneas de investigación se propone poner a prueba un modelo estructural que analizará la relación causal entre la orientación de las empresas tecnológicas hacia la RSC y el performance económico. Los resultados de ese modelo indicarán si la estrategia de RSC, o en una medida importante, explicarían el éxito competitivo y su relación con el performance. Si es así, sería una estrategia interesante para las empresas tecnológicas que la desarrollen determinar cuál es:</p><p>• la intención estratégica de la RSC;</p><p>• participar en la RSC para obtener un beneficio específico;</p><p>• abordar la RSC como una inversión en activos intangibles;</p><p>• centrase en una categoría específica de las partes interesadas (por ejemplo, clientes, empleados, proveedores, etc.);</p><p>• decidir cómo comunicar las iniciativas RSC; y</p><p>• diseñar y gestionar el proceso de toma de decisiones de la RSC.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>been detected how they could facilitate a proactive CSR strategy, proposing the following research hypotheses: H1: There are different motivations for adopting CSR measures in order to facilitate the definitive implementation of CSR in the technology company.

Se interpretan ambos valores con las directrices que ofrecieron Nunnally y Bernstein (1994) los cuales sugieren un valor de 0.7 como punto de referencia para una fiabilidad modesta aplicable en las primeras etapas de investigación. En la presente investigación, los cinco constructos analizados tienen una alta consistencia interna pues se superan los niveles recomendados, ya que, para la fiabilidad compuesta, incluso se supera el umbral más restrictivo propuesto por Nunnally y Bernstein (1994) de 0.8 (ver Tabla 3).</p></div>			</div>
