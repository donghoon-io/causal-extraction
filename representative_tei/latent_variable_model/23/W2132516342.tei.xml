<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we compare conceptualising single factor technical and allocative efficiency as indicators of a single latent variable, or as separate observed variables. In the former case, the impacts on both efficiency types are analysed by means of structural equation modeling (SEM), in the latter by seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). We compare estimation results of the two approaches based on a dataset on single factor irrigation water use efficiency obtained from a survey of 360 farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, China. The main methodological findings are that SEM allows identification of the most important dimension of irrigation water efficiency (technical efficiency) via comparison of their factor scores and reliability. Moreover, it reduces multicollinearity and attenuation bias. It thus is preferable to SUR. The SEM estimates show that perception of water scarcity is the most important positive determinant of both types of efficiency, followed by irrigation infrastructure, income and water price. Furthermore, there is a strong negative reverse effect from efficiency on perception.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The definition of economic efficiency was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Farrell (1957)</ref> and has triggered extensive theoretical and methodological research on its measurement ever 1 since <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kopp, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Greene, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">among others)</ref>. According to Farrell, overall efficiency, later renamed economic efficiency, is a composite concept made up of technical and allocative efficiency. The former is a decision maker's ability to produce a given amount of output using the minimum amount of inputs while the latter is the ability to choose the optimal set of inputs to produce a given output, given prices. Single factor allocative and technical efficiency are defined by analogy with the overall measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kopp, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reinhard et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>From the above definitions, it follows that efficiency is a theoretical construct or latent variable that can only be measured indirectly via observed behaviour, though with measurement error <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Folmer and Oud, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Oud and Folmer, 2008)</ref>. Most researchers tend to ignore that efficiency is a latent variable and focus their theoretical and empirical analyses on the observable indicators instead. To the best of our knowledge, only three papers have treated efficiency as a latent variable. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bollen (1989)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kalaitzandonakes et al. (1992)</ref> analysed the relationship between farm size and technical efficiency by means of a structural equation model with latent variables (SEM) of the Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) type <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(J€ oreskog and Goldberger, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bollen, 1989)</ref>. The authors consider three indicators of the latent variable technical efficiency, viz. technical efficiency scores derived through (i) deterministic parameter frontier analysis, (ii) stochastic parameter frontier analysis, and (iii) non-parametric frontier analysis. 2  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kalaitzandonakes and Dunn (1995)</ref> used the same three indicators to analyse the relationship between education and technical efficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Richards and Jeffrey (2000)</ref> also applied the MIMIC model to analyse the factors that contribute to economic performance. Their indicators of the latent variable performance are allocative, technical and overall efficiency. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref>These three papers did not compare the performance of SEM to alternative (conventional) estimation procedures that do not treat efficiency as a latent variable. A typical alternative approach when there are common factors influencing the disturbances in the different equations is seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The purpose of the present paper is to compare SEM and SUR, and the underlying conceptualisations of technical and allocative efficiency as indicators of a latent variable, versus treating them as separate observed variables. For this purpose we analyse a dataset on irrigation water use efficiency obtained from a survey of 360 farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, China <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tang et al., 2015)</ref>. This study focuses on single factor (irrigation water) efficiency which is the ratio of the minimum feasible use of an input and actual input, keeping other inputs and output constant. Single factor irrigation water technical efficiency has been analysed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lilienfelda and Asmild (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Frija et al. (2009)</ref>. Single-factor allocative efficiency, however, has received little attention in the literature. It is the ratio between the optimal cost (when all inputs are technically and allocatively efficient) and the cost when the single-factor is technically efficient, keeping other inputs constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kopp, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">and Kopp and Diewert, 1982)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>The authors found that the technical efficiency rankings based on the three indicators were not robust to estimation procedure. They ascribed this finding to the fact that the alternative technical efficiency measures had been measured with errors. They turned to SEM to take measurement error into account and to reconcile the conflicting outcomes.</p><p>Both single-factor (irrigation water) technical and allocative efficiency are considered in this paper.</p><p>The organisation of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the conceptual model including a brief summary of SEM. Section 3 discusses the data and the empirical results. Section 4 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Conceptual Model</head><p>Before turning to the conceptual model, we present a brief summary of SEM which can handle latent variables and their indicators within one model framework. A SEM consists of two sub-models: two measurement models (equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and (2) below) and a structural model (equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>)) <ref type="bibr">(J€ oreskog, 1977; J€ oreskog and S€ orbom, 2001)</ref>. The measurement model specifies the relationship between the latent variables and their observed indicators while the structural model represents the relationships between the latent exogenous and the latent endogenous variables as well as the relationships among the latent endogenous variables mutually. Specifically:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y ¼ K y g þ e<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">x ¼ K x n þ d<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">g ¼ Bg þ Cn þ f<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where y and x are p 9 1 and q 9 1 vectors of endogenous and exogenous observed variables, respectively. Λ x and Λ x are p 9 m and q 9 n matrices of regression coefficients or loadings on the m 9 1 and n 9 1 vectors of latent endogenous and latent exogenous variables, g and ξ, respectively. The element b ij of the m 9 m matrix B represents the effect of the jth endogenous latent variable on ith endogenous latent variable, and the element c ij of the m 9 n matrix Γ the effect of the jth exogenous latent variable on ith endogenous latent variable. Finally, ɛ and d are p 9 1 and q 9 1 vectors of measurement errors of y and x, respectively,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> and f is the m 9 1 vector of structural errors. For identification, estimation, testing and modification indices we refer to J€ oreskog and S€ orbom (2001). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Folmer and Oud (2008)</ref> discuss the theoretical and empirical advantages of using SEM. They show that SEM allows a closer correspondence between theory and empirics than a model in observables only. Furthermore, SEM decomposes the variance of an observed variable into the variance of the true (latent) variable and the variance of the measurement error, as shown in equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and (2). It thus reduces measurement error problems. (Note that measurement error in an explanatory variable increases the error variance of the corresponding structural equation, if it is uncorrelated with the observed explanatory variables, and to attenuation bias, if it is correlated. Furthermore, if there is measurement error in the dependent variable, the estimator is biased, if the error is correlated with the explanatory variables; if it is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables, it will lead to larger structural error variance.) The use of SEM may also reduce multicollinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Folmer, 1981)</ref>. Finally, SEM provides information about the weight or impact of the indicators on the corresponding latent variable via the loadings and on their reliability (R 2 ).</p><p>The conceptual SEM and SUR of the irrigation water problem analysed in this paper are presented in Figures 1 5 and 2, and equations ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>), respectively. IWTE and IWAE are observed irrigation water technical efficiency and irrigation water allocative efficiency, respectively, obtained from a stochastic frontier analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tang et al., 2015)</ref>. In SUR they are treated as separate endogenous variables whose disturbances are correlated. In SEM, IWTE and IWAE are taken as indicators of the latent variable Efficiency. In both SUR and SEM, the efficiency variables are functions of a latent variable, Perception (farmer's perception of water scarcity), the farmer characteristics Age, Education, Income and Time (the proportion of time a farmer spends on farming), the farm characteristics Fragmentation (number of different plots) and Infrastructure (dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the irrigation canal is cement, and 0 if it is earthen-lined) and the variables Waterprice and Precipitation. SUR models are typically presented in terms of observed variables; the use of latent variables is unusual in SUR models. We nevertheless use the latent variable Perception in the SUR model to maximise its This approach is adopted if the interest is in the impact of an observable on an endogenous variable. If the interest primarily is in the impacts of the latent variable, the specifications in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and equations ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>) are used. The impacts of the indicators of a latent variable, say Perception, on an indicator, say IWAE, equals the product of the impact of Perception on Efficiency (b 1,2 ) and the impact of Efficiency on IWAE (k 2,1 ).</p><p>Ó 2015 The Agricultural Economics Society similarity to the SEM model. Differences between SEM and SUR can thus be attributed to the way efficiency is modeled. The latent variable Perception is measured by the following three indicators: Percep1 (irrigation water is scarce in my village), Percep2 (irrigation water scarcity is worse now than it was before) and Percep3 (irrigation water will be scarcer in the next 2 years than it is now). Each indicator is measured at a 5-point scale ranging from fully disagree to fully agree. Note that SUR is a special case of SEM. Hence, it can be specified as a SEM and estimated by SEM software packages.</p><p>In terms of equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), the SEM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is expressed as in ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>) and the SUR in ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>). </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">IWTE IWAE Percep1 Percep2 Percep3 2 6 6 6 6 4 3 7 7 7 7 5 ¼ k 1;1 0 k 2;1 0 0 k 3;2 0 k 4;2 0 k 5;</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">5 þ f 1 f 2<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">W ¼ w 11 0 0 w 22 :<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>The first two measurement equations in equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) link the indicators IWTE and IWAE to the latent variable Efficiency. In a similar vein, measurement equations 3-5 in model ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) relate Percep1, Percep2 and Percep3 to the latent variable Perception. Measurement model ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is in terms of observed variables only which means that the observed variables are identical to the corresponding latent variables and that the measurement errors are equal to zero. The first structural equation in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>) specifies Efficiency as a function of the endogenous variable Perception and of the exogenous variables Age, Time, Fragmentation, Infrastructure and Income. Similarly, the second structural equation specifies Perception as a function of Efficiency and of the exogenous variables Income, Education, Water price and Precipitation. In matrix (7), w 11 and w 11 represent variances of f 1 and f 2 , respectively.</p><p>Instead of constructing a latent endogenous variable Efficiency, SUR assumes two observed endogenous variables, i.e. IWTE and IWAE. The first two equations in (8) indicate that the two variables are identical to their corresponding latent variables and that the measurement errors are zeros. The measurement equations 3-5 in (8) are similar to those in model (4). In similar vein, equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) are identical to (5). Since SUR has three endogenous variables (SEM has two), it has three equations in (10). The IWTE and IWAE are functions of the same set of variables as Efficiency in the SEM. Another difference between SEM and SUR is that the structural errors f 1 and f 2 are correlated so that the off-diagonal element w 21 in the 3 9 3 covariance matrix w is non-zero. It is the covariance between the errors of the structural models f 1 and f 2 .  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data and Empirical Results</head><p>We analyse a dataset of 360 farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, China. The data were collected via face-to-face interviews in October 2011. Details on sampling and descriptive statistics are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Before comparing SEM and SUR and discussing the estimates, we make the following remarks. First, a measurement scale was assigned to the latent variables (which is a prerequisite for identification) by fixing their variances (at 1). Secondly, we standardised the coefficients. Hence, a coefficient represents the standard deviation change in a dependent variable due to a standard deviation change in the corresponding explanatory variable, which makes the coefficients directly comparable. Thirdly, because of the presence of ordinal variables, we analysed a polychoric correlation matrix. Finally, we estimated the models by means of LISREL 8.8 <ref type="bibr">(J€ oreskog and S€ orbom, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Ó 2015 The Agricultural Economics Society</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">SEM vs. SUR</head><p>Model fit statistics are presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. They indicate good fit for both models with the SUR statistics slightly better than the SEM statistics. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows that the standardised coefficients of the indicators of Perception in both SEM and SUR are significant. The differences between both models are only minor. Moreover, the reliabilities (R 2 ) are larger than the recommended minimum level of 0.20 <ref type="bibr">(J€ oreskog and S€ orbom, 2001)</ref> indicating that the three indicators measure Perception well. The most reliable indicator is Percep1, followed by Percep2 and Percep3. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> also shows that IWTE and IWAE are significant indicators of Efficiency with the former the most important and most reliable. Particularly, the factor loading of IWTE is 0.78, which is substantially larger than that of IWAE (0.37). This result indicates that irrigation water efficiency is more 'quantity' (technical efficiency) than 'cost' (allocative efficiency) oriented which is probably due to the sub-optimal irrigation water price <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tang et al., 2015)</ref>. As observed in section 2, the possibility of determining the importance of IWTE and IWAE via comparison of their loadings and reliabilities is one of the Notes: The cut-off values for NFI, GFI, AGFI and RMSEA indicating a good fit are 0.90, 0.95, 0.90 and 0.06, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hooper et al., 2008)</ref>. The higher the NFI, GFI and AGFI values are and the smaller the RMSEA is, the better is the fit.</p><p>main advantages of SEM (compared to SUR and other methods that can only handle observables). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref>We next compare the structural SEM and SUR models. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that Efficiency (SEM), and IWTE and IWAE (SUR) impact Perception negatively and significantly. In addition, the coefficient of Efficiency (À0.69) is larger than those of IWTE (À0.36) and IWAE (À0.57). This result is probably due to the fact that, in contrast to IWTE and IWAE, Efficiency has been purged of its measurement error, which reduces attenuation bias. For the reverse effects, from Perception on Efficiency and IWTE/ IWAE, we also find a difference between SEM and SUR. Specifically, in SEM Perception impacts Efficiency positively and significantly (0.52). In SUR, the impact of Perception on IWAE is also positive and significant. However, its impact on IWTE is insignificant, though positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Determinants of Efficiency</head><p>Since SEM is more informative than SUR, we only discuss the estimated SEM structural model and total effects. The SUR model is presented for comparison; for a discussion of it we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang et al. (2015)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that the coefficient of Perception (0.52) is significant, indicating that the more a farmer perceives water scarcity, the more efficiently he or she uses irrigation water. Time has a negative and significant impact which is possibly due to excess irrigation by full-time farmers. Fragmentation (À0.14) impacts Efficiency negatively and significantly, possibly due to loss of water during conveyance. Furthermore, fragmented plots are not suitable for advanced water-saving techniques. Infrastructure, the presence of cement-lined canals (0.25) improves Efficiency because of less water leakage. Finally, Income increases Efficiency because richer farmers can afford more or more adequate water-saving techniques than poor farmers.</p><p>Efficiency has a negative and significant impact on Perception indicating that an efficient farmer perceives less water scarcity than an inefficient farmer. A possible explanation is that an efficient farmer expects efficiency to reduce the water scarcity problem. The positive and significant coefficient of Water price (0.19) indicates that price induces perception of water scarcity. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> gives an incomplete overview of the impacts because the indirect effects are not taken into account. Therefore, we present in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> the total effects (i.e. the sum of the direct effectthe coefficients in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and the indirect effects) of all variables on Perception, Efficiency and IWTE and IWAE. The variable with the largest total impact (in absolute value) on Perception is Efficiency (À0.51) followed by Precipitation (À0.18), Income (À0.15), Waterprice (0.14) and Infrastructure (À0.13). Perception also has a large impact (À0.26) on itself because of reciprocal causation between Perception and Efficiency. The total impacts of the other variables are small or insignificant. The most important determinant of Efficiency is Perception (0.38), followed by Infrastructure (0.18), Income (0.12) and Water price (0.07). The main determinants of IWTE are Efficiency (0.57), Perception (0.30) and Infrastructure (0.14). The results for IWAE are similar, though the total effects are substantially smaller due to the smaller impact of Efficiency. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The purpose of this paper is to compare two different ways of conceptualising technical and allocative efficiencyas indicators of a single latent variable or as separate observed variables and the related modeling approaches, i.e. structural equation modeling (SEM) and SUR. The main conclusion is that the conceptualisation and the modeling approach affect the estimation results. This conclusion is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kalaitzandonakes et al. (1992)</ref> who found that technical efficiency ranking of farms may not be robust to estimation procedure. A related finding of this paper is that the estimated coefficients are not robust to efficiency measure analysed, which was also observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kalaitzandonakes and Dunn (1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kalaitzandonakes et al. (1992)</ref> recommend SEM to reconcile dissimilar efficiency scores by taking them as indicators of a latent variable and to then apply SEM. The findings of this paper confirm this recommendation. We furthermore summarise several additional reasons to apply SEM including a closer correspondence between theory and empirics, accounting for measurement error and reduction of multicollinearity. SEM also allows comparison of the loadings and reliabilities of the indicators of a latent variable which made it possible to identify the most important and reliable indicator of efficiency. We thus found that irrigation water efficiency is more 'quantity' (technical efficiency) than 'cost' (allocative efficiency) oriented in the Guanzhong Plain. On the basis of these features, we suggest that SEM is preferable to SUR as a tool to analyse the determinants of efficiency. The total effects calculated by SEM showed that perception of water scarcity, irrigation infrastructure, water price and income increase irrigation water efficiency while time spent on farming and fragmentation decreases it. Perception of water scarcity is strongly influenced by efficiency indicating that efficient farmers expect that efficiency may reduce irrigation water scarcity.</p><p>Further research on efficiency as a latent variable is needed. Such research could, inter alia, shed light on technical and allocative efficiency obtained from parametric and non-parametric methods as efficiency measures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
