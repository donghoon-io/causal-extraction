<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -The aim of this paper was to assess the causal relationship(s) between moral hazard and adverse selection of Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) construction projects. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to explore the causes and effects relationships between moral hazard and adverse selection problems in PPP construction projects in Ghana. The study produced a framework to predict, estimate and depict the complex causal relationships (i.e. the directionality) between moral hazard and adverse selection.</p><p>Design/Methodology/Approach -To test the proposed framework, a quantitative methodology was employed, in which, data were collected using research questionnaires that targeted a sample of two-hundred and eighty public-private-partnership (PPP) stakeholders in Ghana. A total of two hundred and ten useable questionnaires were retrieved representing a response rate of seventy-five percent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings -</head><p>The interrelationships between the eight causes and nine effects of moral hazard and adverse selection were established using the model. The tested framework showed the degree of association and isolation of the unobserved variables on the indicator factors. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of items to latent constructs. Because the fit of each model was good and the item loadings were adequate, it was assumed that the indicators of the different variables factors were fitting. Furthermore, a diagnostic fit analysis was conducted using the robust maximum likelihood method to test the statistical significance of the parameter estimates.</p><p>Originality/Value -The research findings will serve as a guide for construction stakeholders in the PPP sector on the causes and effects of adverse selection and moral hazard, and how to mitigate these.</p><p>Practical Implications -This novel research is one of the few studies investigating the causal relationships between moral hazard and adverse selection of PPP construction projects. The research concluded with future studies that seek to validate the model developed in other countries and/ or other industries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>An immediate challenge that faces Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) is the existence of informational asymmetries among the government (a principal) and the private firm (an agent) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blanc-Brude, 2013)</ref>. For this reason, information asymmetries must be factored during the design of any PPP contract <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ceric, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De-Palma et al., 2009)</ref>. Often and during the contract work, the agent is better informed than the principal on related ongoing activities and the actions of the private party that impact on these activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blanc-Brude, 2013)</ref>. For example, the principal cannot observe or substantiate if the firm applies maximum effort required in the construction process <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>. A moral hazard problem arises when the agent's action is not verifiable, or when the agent receives private information after the partnership has been commenced. Moral hazard should not pose a challenge or problem if both the principal and agent had the same objective functions. However, the misunderstanding about which action should be taken is the basis for agency costs <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blanc-Brude, 2013</ref>).</p><p>An adverse selection problem happens when the agent holds private information before the relationship begins. The principal can authenticate the agent's behaviour; however, the optimal decision which is the cost of this decision relies on the agent's type (which is considered to be private information related to the agent). Although the principal can be aware that the agent can be one of several possible types, they cannot identify the exact type without access to the agent <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>. Moral hazard and adverse selection problems often do not exist in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Yang and Yang, 2010)</ref>. This is normally a result of the existence of synergies between stages of the venture, accounting for why different tasks are bundled in a distinct activity and delegated to a sole responsible agent firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Biong, 2013)</ref>. The effort that the agent firm exerts at the construction stage influences the circumstances it encounters at the operation stage. For example, exercising effort might enhance the chance of meeting a high demand for the service (as the infrastructure is more dependable) or, a reduced price of production (as the cost is an internal attribute of the project). As such, provision of effort by the agent is advantageous <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blanc-Brude, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Within extant literature, moral hazard and adverse selection research frontiers have been expanded and propagated by various authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Monteiro, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wuyts et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blombäck and Axelsson, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Biong (2013)</ref> investigated reputation and pricing effects on choosing subcontractors in asymmetric markets while, <ref type="bibr">Monteiro (2009)</ref> explored risk management in agency relationships. According to <ref type="bibr">Monteiro (2009)</ref>, in the project's bidding phase, the tenderer does not know precisely the bidder's technical strength, level of management, service quality among others. The bidder is similarly unclear of the tender's financial capacity and business reputation. This can create both moral hazard and adverse selection problems. However, most authors examined moral hazard and adverse selection concentrating on procurement systems, supply chain management, outsourcing, and make-or-buy decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ive and Chang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yiu et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tedelis, 2002)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Corvellec and Macheridis (2010)</ref> conducted a study on the impact of adverse selection on building performance and quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Unsal and Taylor (2010)</ref> investigated sub-contracting problems associated with information asymmetry while <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ceric (2010)</ref> investigated the role of moral hazard and adverse selection on procurement systems. This research goes further by identifying the causes and effects relationship between moral hazard and adverse selection on Ghanaian PPP construction projects. The research findings will serve as a guide for construction stakeholders in the PPP sector on the causes and effects of adverse selection and moral hazard, and how to mitigate these.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPLORING AGENCY THEORY IN PPP CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS:</head><p>The Principal-Agent problem is the situation in a contract where one of the parties involved in the contarct is better informed than the other party <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jäger, 2008)</ref>. In PPP construction projects, normally, the government and a private sector firm(s) have a principal and agent relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Turner and Müller, 2004)</ref>. The principal-agent relationship establishes a delegation of tasks between the principal and the agent where the principal depends on the agent to undertake a task on their behalf <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Müller and Turner, 2005)</ref>. Hence, it is assumed that an agent will try to maximise their benefit even when that may involve a higher damage to the client <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Schieg, 2008)</ref>. According to the Principal-Agent theory, this problem is characterised by the issues concerning the relationship between the principal and the agent, which might include adverse selection and moral hazard <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ceric, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ceric, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>According to the Project Management <ref type="bibr">Institute (2000)</ref>, the project owner is a person or the group of people responsible for providing financial resources for the delivery and completion of the project <ref type="bibr">(Project Management Institute, 2000)</ref>. Ideally, in a PPP setting, the public sector engages the private sector to undertake activities required to finish the project. According to the Principal-Agent theory, the relationship between the two parties also involves self-interest of each party <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Schieg, 2008)</ref>. When one of the two parties is better informed than the other, it is characterised by information asymmetry. Information asymmetries exist whenever the agent and principal do not possess the same level of information at the same time. The stakeholders in a PPP construction project are expected to work together to meet the goals of time, quality and cost. However, due to self-interest, they may not share all the information accrued. This normally leads to two different types of information asymmetries, namely: hidden characteristics and hidden information <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Winch, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral Hazard</head><p>Moral hazard should not pose a challenge or problem when both the principal and agent share the same objective when conducting all the project required functions. Any misunderstanding related to which action(s) should be taken and at what time normally create the basis for agency costs <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>. A moral hazard problem can be one of two potential cases, namely:</p><p>Case One:-The parties possess similar information at the time during which the relationship is established. Informational asymmetry arises immediately after signing the contract as the principal cannot verify and observe the efforts and actions of the agent, or in some cases, the principal cannot flawlessly control such efforts and actions. In modelling this condition, the assumption is made that the agent's effort post contract signature, is not confirmable and accordingly, this variable cannot be plainly added to the contract stipulations/ clauses.</p><p>Case Two:-Some moral hazard problems are attributed to informational asymmetries that occur before accomplishing the contract efforts -particularly, when the agent monitors the product of the environment's decision but the principal does not. Once the contract is signed, the uncertainty is identical for both the principal and agent, but before starting the contract action(s), the agent will have an informational benefit by observing an appropriate variable <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>. Within this regard, this second type of moral hazard challenge is much less represented in extant literature. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chiocha (2009)</ref>, in Malawi, a number of building project inspectors indulged in collusion as a result of moral hazard thereby bringing the concept of monitoring into disrepute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Selection</head><p>An adverse selection problem occurs when the agent holds private information before the relationship begins. The principal can authenticate the agent's behavior -however, the cost of obtaining the optimal decision relies upon the agent's type which is private information considering the agent. Although the principal might be aware that the agent can be one of several possible types, the principal cannot identify such types without having access to the agent full details <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>. In disparity to the moral hazard problem where the uncertainty is exogenous, in this instance, the uncertainty is exogenous to the principal. The adverse selection challenge exists not only when the agent's informal actions relate to their own private features, but also when there is asymmetric information relating to any variable relevant to the contracted partnership. A typical example is of a public agency which contracts a private firm for the building of a hospital while lacking knowledge concerning the most current technological innovations, regarding the building of hospitals <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ameyaw et al. (2011)</ref> in Ghana showed that due to adverse selection, there has been corruption in project procurement right from project inception to completion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF MORAL HAZARD AND ADVERSE SELECTION OF PPP PROJECTS:</head><p>One of the main causes of information asymmetry problem is that effort dimensions are not verifiable as a significant cause. The extent of effort exerted in work cannot be specified in the contracts hence leading to problemsthe agent then has the incentive to minimise effort when undertaking work to maximise profit <ref type="bibr">(Guasch, 2004)</ref>. Low transfer of risks causes moral hazard and adverse selection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boukendour, 2007)</ref>. Inexperience as a cause occurs when inexperienced contractors bid for PPP projects and withhold vital information from the principal before the relationship begins <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Another major cause of moral hazard and adverse selection of PPP construction projects is low incentives. When the risks and liability of cost overruns are not tolerated by the party constructing, low incentive mentality to control costs prevails <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blanc-Brude, 2013)</ref>. In renegotiation of contracts, renegotiation incidents being persistent in PPPs lead to agency problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Guasch et al., 2008)</ref>. There have been calls for laws that prevent renegotiation of contracts in PPPs by some procurement models, but many of these models cannot be adapted by modern contracts <ref type="bibr">(Laffont 2003)</ref>. Lack of accurate information about project conditions is another cause of moral hazard and adverse selection. Due to the long-term scope of PPP projects, accurate information on the existing, future and indirect costs of the works are obscured. This increases the prevalence of moral hazard and adverse selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blanc-Brude, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">and Loben, 2009)</ref>. Limited ability to commit to contractual obligations is also a cause and is referred to as conditions of restricted commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Iossa and Martimort, 2008)</ref>. In these instances, contractual parties are unable to abide by their obligations spelt out in the contract <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Estache and Wren-Lewis, 2008)</ref>. Choosing the wrong party to execute the work leads to moral hazard and adverse selection problems. Adverse selection results when the contractor selects the wrong party (agent), to begin with. This leads to moral hazard problems of cost overruns and poor risk management <ref type="bibr">(Loben, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Siphoning of funds is a significant effect arising from moral hazard and adverse selection. The agent of the contract may syphon funds, and this works against the principal hence, instead of focusing on work that drives success, the agent can divert monies for private consumption and remaining funds to create the impression of productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chong et al., 2007)</ref>. Information asymmetry stimulates opportunistic behaviour which is an effect of moral hazard and adverse selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Schieg, 2008)</ref>. In the project's bidding phase, the tenderer does not know clearly the bidder's technical strength and the bidder is also unclear of the tender's financial ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martimort and Straub, 2008)</ref>. Consequences on profitability is another effect. Private investment becomes difficult to attract especially when projects are large and private sponsors are averse to risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Iossa and Martimort, 2008)</ref>. Moral hazard leads to negative implications for the enforceability of the contract <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chong et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Reduction of competition occurs because of moral hazard and adverse selection. When bidders develop an innovative offer, they risk losing the tender and not being repaid for the innovation <ref type="bibr">(Badenfelt, 2008)</ref>. This limits the number of bidders and successively failed bids erode competition as the opportunity to win a contract is outweighed by the cost of lost bids <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boukendour, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Corruption is also an effect of moral hazard and adverse selection. The construction industry worldwide has a negative reputation for bribery and corruption incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sohail and Cavill, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Martimort and Straub (2008)</ref> suggest that countries with multi-level systems of government are more exposed to corruption. Consequently, dishonesty is a widespread effect of adverse selection and moral hazard and asymmetric information can engender dishonesty to create a major project risk in construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martimort and Straub, 2008)</ref>. In addition, high transaction costs are a consequence of moral hazard and adverse selection. Transaction costs arise because the government negotiates with and monitors the private sector partners who have their interests and agendas <ref type="bibr">(Muhwezi et al., 2014)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>A questionnaire survey was used as the main instrument to collect research required data. Both primary and secondary quantitative data were utilized, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was the primary analytical tool for developing the research framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tong, 2007)</ref>. Sample size has an important effect on model fit in SEM analysis and model testing. <ref type="bibr">Tong (ibid)</ref> stressed that small sample size leads to more bias in model fit and makes the model ineffective. According to El-Gohary and El-Gohary (2016); El-Gohary (2014); El-Gohary ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>), a sample size of 100 is considered small leading to undesirable results in SEM; a fact also noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">El-Gohary (2009)</ref> and Iacobucci (2010). For optimal SEM analysis, a sample size of 200 or more with a specific number of variables is ideal for a good fit model analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Curran et al., 2004)</ref>. The questionnaire comprised questions primarily closed-ended and scaled-response type. Respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1-5 the relationship between effects and causes of moral hazard and adverse selection. The causes and effects of moral hazard and adverse selection were coded in the questionnaire and this was used in SEM analysis (refer to Tables <ref type="table">I</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II)</ref> A purposive sampling technique was adopted which consisted identifying professionals involved in Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) construction projects. Purposive sampling is very useful for instances where the researcher needs to contact a targeted sample fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Tongco, 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, snowball-sampling technique was also used to secure an adequate sample size given the different challenges encountered in evaluating the population size <ref type="bibr">(Creswell, 2005)</ref>. This mixed-sampling process continued until a representative sample size of fifty-six (56) government agencies, consultancy firms and construction companies in charge of Public Private Partnership projects was obtained in Ghana. Questionnaires were distributed in the cities of Accra and Kumasi to five (5) respondents in each one of these companies and/ or agencies resulting in a total of two hundred and eighty (280) potential respondents. Two hundred and ten (210) useable questionnaires representing seventy-five percent (75%) response rate were attained back.</p><p>The SEM tool was adopted as the best tool for developing the structural model. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kline (2010)</ref>, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) exist as the most useful approaches in analysing SEM variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bentler, 2005)</ref>. The purpose of EFA is to explore the probable fundamental factor structure in a set of observed variables <ref type="bibr">(Byrne, 2006)</ref>. CFA conversely confirms already recognised factor structure of a set of observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. For this study, CFA was the best in analysing the constructs in the model and the causal relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. CFA was undertaken on the exogenous variables to define its best fit for the model. The main approaches used in SEM to suitably develop models are score reliability and validity, covariance analysis, z-tests, the test of significance and measure of goodness of fit of the model. Data retrieved from fieldwork was carefully reviewed then inputted into SPSS, and later extrapolated into STATA and AMOS for further analysis. P-values were used to explain the statistical significance. This was done by convention and further compared to past studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kwofie et al. (2014)</ref>. The p-value was set at 0.05 and infers a ninety-five percent chance that the population mean is within a stated range of values. As recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hair et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eid and El-Gohary (2013)</ref>, this research adopted multi approaches to assess model fit. Practically, the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR), goodness of fit index (GFI), bentler comparative fit index (CFI), chi-square (χ2), satorrabentler scaled chi-square (S -Bχ2), root mean square error of approximation (with its 90% or 95% confidence interval) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) which deliver the essential signs of how best the theory fits the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. A mixture of incremental/comparative fit indices and absolute fit index is however recommended for SEM analysis.</p><p>Fit indexes of CFI, χ2, GFI and S -Bχ2 are under the incremental/ comparative fit indices and RMSEA and SRMR instead, are under the absolute fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kline, 2010)</ref>. The RMSEA and SRMR further define how best a model fits the data and indicates if proposed model is the best fit or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(McDonald and Ho, 2002)</ref>. This research utilised three indices, namely: CFI, RMSEA and GFI. This was done to achieve a robust standard to assess the model fit. The χ2 was chosen to evaluate the acceptance of the mode generated. By convention, GFI result nearer to 0.95 or greater than 0.90 is appropriate for model test of fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kline, 2010)</ref>. According to Wong (2011), the satisfactory or acceptable cut-off benchmarks of fit statistics are: CFI = value should be ≥ 0.95 for good fit and 0.90 for acceptable fit; chi-square (χ2) ratio to df ≤ 3 or5 with an insignificant or significant p value (p &gt; 0.05); SRMR = value should be ≤ 0.05 as good fit and ≤ 0.08 for acceptable fit (value of 0.1 is also acceptable); RMSEA = value should be &lt; 0.05 for good fit (values &lt; and 0.08 indicate a reasonable and acceptable error of approximation and values of &gt; 0.10 suggests a poor fit), and finally, RMSEA at 90% CI = values to be &lt; 0.05 to 0.08 with confidence interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:</head><p>Under the SEM technique, models which will be estimated are normally represented in graphical diagrams. These diagrams indicate the assumed relationship(s) between the variables by linking arrows among the independent and dependent variables. It is recommended that a very stable identified model must indicate a positive degree of freedom for the parameters in the overidentified model <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lei and Wu, 2008)</ref>. In this study, a preliminary analysis by way of CFA produced values of 2 and 14 as minimum and maximum degrees of freedom respectively. This proves a very suitable positive value of the degree of freedom. It is inferred that this model can be estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of Unobserved Constructs:</head><p>CFA is a statistical method that verifies factor structure of a set of observed variables. It is normally used in the measurement of SEM models. The assessment of independent and dependent variables as being enough indicators is crucial in evaluating measurement invariance (MI). CFA should firstly be done on every latent variable by evaluating the coefficients and confirming the factor structure of every variable. This is to prevent any possible MI which may affect the good-fit of the model. If the fit of each model is good and the item loading is adequate, it is assumed that the indicators of the factors are fitting. The causes and effects of moral hazard and adverse selection were coded for SEM analysis (refer to Tables <ref type="table">I</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>).</p><p>&lt;Insert Tables I and II about Here&gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Low incentives to control costs:</head><p>Low incentives to control costs was analysed using the responses obtained from the data collection process and CFA on nine (9) variables in the construct. There is a need to analytically evaluate all the variables to settle on the ones in the model, which succinctly measure and explain a construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bentler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wong, 2010)</ref>. Usually, correlations, standard errors and standardised residual covariance are important guidelines in choosing the most acceptable variables which must be in the construct for further analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Field, 2009)</ref>. From Table IIIa and b, the variables C1A, C1E, C1F and C1G were excluded. The remaining five variables were subjected to detailed CFA tests. An accurate and robust SEM should have both fixed and free parameters to be estimated from the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bentler, 2005)</ref>. Their significance, validity, model fit and parameter estimates were found.</p><p>&lt;Insert Tables III (a) and III (b) about Here&gt;</p><p>The model fit assessment must utilise multiple standards of both absolute and incremental fit indices to support the chi-square test. Although chi-square is a good measure of fit, it is affected by the sample size and hence, gives erroneous probability figures <ref type="bibr">(Byrne, 2006)</ref>. Consequently, the satorra-bentler scaled chi-square (S -Bχ2) was used as it provides a much better fit <ref type="bibr">(Iacobucci, 2010)</ref>. From Table III (a) and (b), the CFI and GFI values were 0.951 and 0.983 correspondingly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bentler (2005)</ref> suggests that CFI values above 0.90 provide a good fit whereas, GFI test values of 0.90 and above also provide a good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lei and Wu, 2008)</ref>. The RMSEA value was 0.065 and illustrates that a good fit was obtained (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bentler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lei and Wu, 2008)</ref>. Sample data on low incentives to control cost measurement model produced S -Bχ2 to be 9.481 with a degree of freedom (df) equal 5 while the sig. value (p-value) was 0.091. The overall goodness of fit is revealed by the magnitude of discrepancy amongst the sample covariance matrix and the covariance matrix (population) inferred by the model such that the good model fit must possess df value ˃ 0 and sig. values (p values) ˃ 0.05.</p><p>A p-value ˃ 0.05 related to S -Bχ2 shows that the difference between the sample data and low incentives to control cost measurement model is insignificant and hence, the model fits the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kline, 2010)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hair et al., (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kaplan (2009)</ref>, Z-values (critical ratios) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) figures are important in explaining the significance and effects of the different parameters within a model. Correlation values and standard errors showed that all the coefficient values were less than 1.00. Z statistics had a positive value higher than 1.96 and therefore deemed to be very suitable. The Z test statistics showed the significance or otherwise of the path coefficients of the model. As indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kline (2010)</ref>, utilising a two-tailed Z-test with a significance level of 0.05, path coefficient is significant if Z statistics exceeds 1.96. All Z-values resulted from the data analysis exceeded 1.96 and therefore implies that the indicator variables loadings are very significant. R 2 , which is the coefficient of determination, measures the predictive accuracy of the model. The effect of measurement of R 2 spans between 0 and 1. The value 1 signifies perfect accuracy of prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. A value of 0.75 or greater is seen as substantial, 0.50 is moderate while 0.25 or lesser signifies reflects weak accuracy of prediction <ref type="bibr">(Henseler et al., 2010)</ref>. From the results of CFA analysis, the robust fit indices met the prescribed cut-off criteria and hence the model sufficiently fits the data. All parameters estimates were found to be both statistically significant and viable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Lack of Accurate Information about Project Condition:</head><p>After preliminary CFA tests, variables C4A, C4B, C4D and C4F were excluded. Hence, they did not form part of the detailed CFA analysis. The sample data on this model gave an S -Bχ2 value of 8.94 with 5 degrees of freedom and the p-value for the sample size of 210 is 0.111. Since chisquare value is greater than 0.05, it implies that the difference between the sample data and the hypothesised lack of accurate information about project condition factor is not significant. The fit function is good and well-specified leading to the model being retained (refer to Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">VI (a</ref> The robust CFI and GFI indices were 0.885 and 0.984 respectively.

The RMSEA value is 0.061, which is acceptable. From Tables Via and b, all the standard errors were below 1.00 and therefore adequate and reasonable. The Z values were all above the standard value of 1.96 based on the probability level of 0.05. Four of the p-values were below 0.05. This proves that many of the variables were genuinely statistically significant to the factor. The parameter estimates indicated satisfactory linkages with the factor construct.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Siphoning of funds arises due to moral hazard and adverse selection. The agent could siphon funds and this works against the principal hence, instead of focusing on work that drives success, the agent can divert monies for private consumption and remaining funds to create the impression of productivity. Monitoring this situation brings about three challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chong et al., 2007)</ref>. First, firms may attempt to win the contract with limited effort and with the premeditated intention of siphoning all funds. Second, a firm which has worked efficiently according to contract may start siphoning funds whilst waiting to exercise the option of revealing success at a future more convenient date. Third, towards the end of contract, a firm may cease exerting effort and start siphoning funds, because the probability of success fails to justify the exertion of more effort. For instance, a construction company may succeed at the end of a large project and then delay completion of the less demanding activities over time to stretch out payments received from the principal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chong et al., 2007)</ref>. Consequences on profitability is another effect. Because of the inherent challenges involved in producing accurate estimates, the firm's profits are largely uncertain before the operation phase starts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chong et al., 2007)</ref>. Private investment becomes difficult to attract especially when projects are large and private sponsors are averse to risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Iossa and Martimort, 2008)</ref>. In Europe, cross border infrastructure has received little concern from private financiers. Even when private investors turn up, they tend to behave opportunistically leading to moral hazard <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chong et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>The research identified the causes and effects of moral hazard and adverse selection on PPP construction projects. Research findings have contributed to past studies and existing knowledge on PPP and information asymmetry, and have shed much needed light onto moral hazard and adverse selection. SEM was used to explore the causal relationships between the causes and effects of moral hazard and adverse selection problems in PPP construction projects. Causes being the independent variables (IV) and effects the dependent variables (DV). The measured model was used to predict, estimate and depict the complex causal relationships (i.e. the directionality). It further showed the degree of association and isolation of the unobserved variables on the indicator factors. CFA was used to evaluate the fit of items to latent constructs. Since the fit of each model was good and the item loadings were adequate, it was assumed that the indicators of the factors were fitting. The diagnostic fit analysis was conducted using robust maximum likelihood to test statistical significance of parameter estimates and the results indicated a good fit. The majority of previous studies had assessed the causal relationships between different variables using univariate statistical tools like MANOVA, ANOVA or multiple regression modelling to produce models. Yet these models are unable to adequately illustrate the complete relationships among the dependent variables and independent variables because they condense and relate several independent variables into one dependent variable. In this research, SEM was utilized because it provides a better approach in investigating the causal relationships in a model and the direction of influence within it. Moreover, it can be concluded that this study is one of the first studies using SEM to investigate causal and effects relationships of moral hazard and adverse selection on PPP construction projects. However, the model developed was not validated and so consequently, future studies are required to: validate the model developed; and expand the relevance of the model to other national and industry settings. Execution of PPP projects in African countries still remains a significant challenge and is mainly due to information asymmetry. The research findings will serve as a guide for construction stakeholders in the PPP sector on the causes and effects of adverse selection and moral hazard, and how to mitigate these. Moral hazard and adverse selection are serious problems bedeviling the construction industries of developing countries including Ghana. Hence, it is essential to introduce the use of incentives and monitoring mechanism into project contracts. This will go a long way to reduce information asymmetry.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure I below illustrates the conceptual framework for the study. &lt;Insert Figure I about Here&gt;</figDesc></figure>
