<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Creating a proper career program is the best way to enhance employees' organizational commitment; it motivates and retains them. This research aims to measure career growth's influence on turnover intention, mediated by employees' commitment through self-reported employees' perceptions. This study identifies the key dimensions of organizational commitment (affective, continuance and normative commitment) that mediate the relationship between career growth and employee turnover intention exploring the indirect effects between career growth and turnover intention. The relationship is examined among the public sector employees in the Sultanate of Oman, a sector currently facing high turnover rates and losing key skilled talent pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>Data collection was executed through an adopted questionnaire distributed among 500 employees of 38 government units within the Sultanate of Oman. A total of 351 questionnaires were returned, and after the initial screening process, 329 were found to be valid for further analysis. CFA analysis was conducted to identify the factors falling under the three primary constructs of the study. Assessment of the models was explained through Goodness-of-fit Indices. Structural equation modeling, which is most recommended to study the effect of latent variables, was performed using AMOS to evaluate the mediating role of organizational commitment between career growth and employee turnover intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head><p>The results indicated that the potential for career growth is an essential motivating element for public sector employees in the Sultanate of Oman to encourage retention and reduce intention to leave. The findings also confirm that effective and continuous commitment</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Any governmental and commercial organization will be challenged to retain its most valuable employees. Learning organizations improve the performance of their employees and reduce their intention to leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, this competition continues to intensify however, the public sector with less advancement in its traditional practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is at a disadvantage. But, the improvement can be noticed in current managerial practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Employees seek an apparent career growth in the organization, a perceived value that enhances their organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>, which may further discourage them from leaving the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Thus, creating a proper career growth-path is essential to retain existing employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and attracts potential talents and contributes to the recruitment function's effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The development and implementation of a career program cannot happen overnight; it requires a long-term commitment and a holistic approach in managing the workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and demands effort and commitment on the part of top management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, line managers and human resource personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Also, the best practice of the concept of career growth strategy may not be suitable to every environment and must be adopted to fit cultural contexts.</p><p>Omani economy functions on both public and private sectors. Private sector includes for profit organizations such as retail, commercial establishments, manufacturing sector, hotel industry, hospitality industry and private health care. Whereas the public sector of Oman inlcudes, Government institutions such as the Central Bank of Oman, Government Authorities such as Public Authority for Water, Government-owned companies such as Mwasalat, along with several offices serving health, agriculture, tourism, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Public sector in Oman is highly significant in terms of contribution to the economy and has a manpower of around 229,386 actively servng the sector by end of 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Employee retention has become a considerable challenge to the public sector in the Sultanate of Oman. It has been losing out on key technical and management personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, thus creating a severe talent gap in the sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>A systematic literature review was conducted to understand the problem and formulate research hypotheses. This section is divided into four parts: career growth, employee turnover intention, organizational commitment and relationships between the study variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career growth</head><p>Career growth is the progression of a career, related prospects, experiences, duties, and responsibilities through intervention and purposeful responsibility of individuals and their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Previously, many aspects of career growth have been studied, such as career self-management, employees' early experiences in an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, and their urge for promotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Though career development is sometimes used interchangeably with career growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the former term is more concerned with the career plans structured and managed by employees and organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. As the study of Tabachnick and Fidell has dubbed as an alternative to the career growth concept, the concept of career ladder explains that employees gain skills and upgrade their performance by efforts to improve their positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Career planning, an essential requirement in career growth, is how individuals and organizations identify their skills, opportunities, and interests as well as work towards achieving their career objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The literature on career growth specifies that promote equity and job rotation are important sub-constructs in measuring career growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Career growth encompasses four essential components: career goal progression, professional ability development, promotion speed and remuneration growth. Employees feel an affinity towards their organization if it provides an environment that supports their career goal progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Employees feel that their employers are committed to their career progression if they foresee a clear perspective about their future <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. It positively impacts their organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Professional ability development refers to the deliberate actions by employers aimed at developing abilities, skills and knowledge required by employees to perform their day-to-day tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Available literature indicates that professional ability development can impact organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. As a piece of evidence for employers' effective HRM strategies, such programs encourage reciprocity between two parties and ultimately result in creating employees' emotional attachment and loyalty to their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Promotion speed refers to the time taken in ascending the company's positional ladder <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It essentially involves an increase in job scope and responsibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, which is usually treated as a visible organization-wide sign of achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>; 2019; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Remuneration growth is an essential component of career growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that, according to the Social Exchange Theory, includes fair pay for the job done <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55]</ref> along with benefits, which ultimately attract the employees' attention towards improved employee retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employee turnover intention</head><p>Turnover intention refers to an employee's intention to leave his or her current organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, which is essentially a psychological process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> wherein an employee considers leaving or resigning as well as searching for other work <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. It can be identified in the withdrawal behavior of the employees. This would include work withdrawal, which refers to avoiding aspects of work, and job withdrawal, which refers to non-participation in working situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60]</ref>. Turnover intention shows a breach in the relationship between employees and their employers <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational commitment</head><p>Organizations need to build policies and practices to strengthen organizational commitment and raise employee job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>. Organizational commitment is a driving force for the employees to achieve mutual respect between them and their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>. Employees exhibit organizational commitment when they perceive their organization's commitment to individuals' progression and achieve its objectives, which creates the expected effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66]</ref>, empowering leadership will enhance employee organizational commitment. Premised upon the social exchange theory, organizational commitment can be divided into three types: affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. Affective commitment is based on employers' care and responsibility for their employees. Continuance commitment is based on losing the incentives and seniority if the employees were to leave because they are perceived as essential. Moreover, the final component, normative commitment, is when employees feel grateful and are obliged to be in their organization as a member.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between career growth and employee turnover intention</head><p>Available literature recommends focusing on career growth components as a strategy to reduce turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref> as career growth is more closely related to employees' behaviors and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69]</ref> and can retain employees who are looking to develop their career <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref>. In the previous studies, it is emphasized that low turnover can be affected by the internal career advancement opportunity perceived by the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> and perceived fairness in terms of awards and promotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75]</ref>; Job rotation as a career growth strategy can cause job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref> and promote retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>. A study used the model (which is adopted in this research) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and found that career growth correlated negatively with turnover intention. Along with <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, many studies used this model to examine turnover intention and organizational commitment. For example, a study done in Turkey by Karavardar <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> found that remuneration growth and professional ability development have a strong negative impact on turnover intention. Similarly, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, there is a negative association between turnover and promotion speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between career growth and organizational commitments</head><p>Researchers found that career growth components, such as professional development opportunity, promotion speed and remuneration growth, have been positively associated with employees' commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>, as the committed employees are more likely to participate in the organizational improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">88]</ref>. Organizations must offer opportunities for career advancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref> as professional development strategies contribute to career growth which in turn can contribute to employee commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, particularly to continuance commitment. Promotion speed also may improve employees' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>, as it is more likely to develop a sense of belonging and enhance job satisfaction as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>. Another factor, remuneration growth or attractive compensation structure, can lead to a positive employee perception of their remuneration, which in turn increases organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">84]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between employee turnover intention and organizational commitment</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>, organizations must devise strategies to enhance employee commitment to reduce turnover, because a negative correlation has been found between these two variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, organizational commitment is an important element that negatively affects turnover intention than other elements, such as career growth. Similar findings are also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref>, who studied call center workers. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref>, the relationship between affective commitment and turnover intention is negatively related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between three variables</head><p>Proposed hypothesis of the model that was presented in Fig 2 <ref type="figure">attempts</ref> to explain the relationship between the study variables. The hypothesis model was proposed based on the literature review. Available literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">97]</ref> indicates that organizational commitment is positively impacted by the potential for career growth and negatively impacted by turnover intention. Further, a detailed analysis of setting up of hypotheses was expalined on page numbers . . .. . .. . . clearly explaining the relationship between career growth and affective commitment (H1), continuance commitment (H2), normative commitment (H3) along with turnover intension (H4). Hypotheses explaining the relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intention are set from H5 to H7. Mediating role of organizational commitment was explained through hypotheses, H 8 to H10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for the study</head><p>In spite of several studies conducted to test career growth and organizational commitment connecting with the turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81]</ref>, insufficient attention has been paid to understand the public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The ample empirical research on career growth, organizational commitment and turnover intention that has been conducted in Western countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">99]</ref> and Eastern countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[106]</ref> may not have much validity in the Middle Eastern context <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref>. As such, more research is required to understand how people in different parts of the world conceptualize and understand individual behaviors that encourage them to continue their work within their current organizations. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, most literature reviews in this area do not include all organizational commitment components. Hence, to fill the research gap, this study has tested all three components of organizational commitment and how they mediated the relationship between career growth and turnover intention, thus contributing to the theoretical robustness of the model originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, who conducted a qualitative study in Oman, organizational commitment is a major theme that indicated diminished normative commitment. This reinforces the need for further exploratory testing of all three components of organizational commitment quantitatively. Finally, in terms of practical significance, there are currently a limited number of studies that have been conducted on this aspect specifically focused on Oman's public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref>, because of economic growth in the GCC region, there is strong competition among public-sectors of the member countries regarding employees' skills, which are negatively affected by turnover. This study attains significance in this scenario by addressing turnover intention in the public sector of Oman to discover the reasons behind individual attrition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective of the study</head><p>This research aims to examine the mediating role of organizational commitment that influences the impact of career growth on the turnover intention in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research methodology</head><p>This descriptive research was conducted with the help of the survey method <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">113]</ref>, as this approach seemed to be an optimal alternative to other data collection methods because it poses straightforward and standard questions at a homogeneous sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[114]</ref> and enables data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of population and sampling</head><p>The target population for this study comprises the permanent employees working in the public sector in the Sultanate of Oman with at least three years of service. The reason behind choosing three years' experience is to ensure that the employees are entrenched in their career and not new employees. Employees located in selected Ministries in the Government were chosen as respondents to accomplish the study's aims. The survey targeted active employees in 38 Ministries in the Sultanate of Oman with at least three years of service. A stratified convenience sampling method was used to select the respondents for this study. A total of 500 survey questionnaires were distributed to public sector employees-out of which 351 questionnaires were returned. Furthermore, after initial screening, 329 valid questionnaires were considered for the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining the adequacy of sample size</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[116]</ref>, various aspects, such as cost, time and resource availability, should be considered while determining the sample size. Furthermore, it is important to consider the effects that the sample size has on the statistical accuracy of the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>. As there is no real science when selecting the sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[117]</ref>, the sample size for this research was based on what past researchers have recommended. A suitable sample size regarding to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is based on the ratio of 1:40, which means for each variable of the study, there have to be at least 40 samples if the study employs a regression analysis. Based on this rule, the recommended sample size should be a minimum of 320 (8 x 40) cases. Additionally, another argument by <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[118]</ref> discussed that six independent variables could be calculated as 104 + 6 = 110 cases that may need to exam individual predictors, plus 50 + (8) (6) = 98 cases to exam the regression. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref> noted that every research is unique, and thus, has different requirements. Therefore, the sample size should be based on the research requirements rather than on the statistical assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>. Furthermore, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[119]</ref>, the basic rule of thumb on determining the adequate sample size. Based on the various assumptions and guidelines provided by the previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">120]</ref>, this study has chosen the large number that can rely and ensure the minimum cases needed for successful structural equation modelling (SEM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire design</head><p>For a questionnaire survey to be done successfully, the questions need to be straightforward, the layout should be clear, and the sequence should be easy to follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref>. Additionally, the questionnaire should be able to translate the information that is needed and be entertaining so as not to cause the respondent to be bored. Finally, it should seek to reduce response error <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[117]</ref>. The questionnaire for this research was designed based on an extensive literature review. An adapted version of the questionnaire was used in this study. However, a few items were also modified accordingly to fulfill the purpose of the research interest and to fit the Omani context. Though the questionnaire was developed in English, keeping in mind concerning language barrier, it is translated into Arabic. A five-point Likert scale was used to scale rangingfrom 'strongly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Section one consisted of demographic information, and section two consisted of problem-related variables identified for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables considered for the study</head><p>Along with the demographic variables, 31 problem-related variables were considered for study based on the literature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). They are further divided into three constructs: career growth, organizational commitment and employee turnover based on the literature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Four sub-constructs that describe career growth are career goal progress (variables 1 to 4), professional ability development (variables 5-8), promotion speed (variables 9-12) and remuneration growth (variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Three sub-constructs that describe organizational commitment are affective commitment (variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, continuance commitment (variables 20-23) and normative commitment (variables 24-28). Finally, employee turnover intension is described by variables 29-31.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis tools</head><p>This study employed various analyses, including demographic, descriptive, reliability as well as validity testing. Using AMOS software Version 21, descriptive statistics were used to identify the importance of individual variables, Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to group variables into factors and constructs, and Structural Equation Modelling was employed for testing the hypotheses to prove the mediating role of organizational commitment between career growth and turnover intention. Hypotheses were formulated after a careful review of literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[117]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting of hypotheses</head><p>Career growth and affective commitment. Affective Commitment occurs when an organization fulfills primary needs of its employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>, and thus the employee identifies himself or herself with the organization's goals and strives to facilitate the fulfillment of the goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[122]</ref>. Hence, as a reciprocal response, the organizations must meet the employees' career goals and contribute to their career growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[123]</ref>. Thus, to propose the first hypothesis in this research, we say that the experience of the employees in career growth must have a higher level of affective commitment. Firstly, employees must be working in a field that is related to their career goals. Secondly, it must make room for professional growth, which allows them to gain new skills. Thirdly, the reward and promotion speed scheme that employees perceive has to be responsive to their efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1:</head><p>There is a significant relationship between career growth and affective commitment in the Omani public sector.</p><p>Career growth and continuance commitment. Though the disadvantage of discontinuing work and the cost of leaving may contribute to continuance commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref>, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref>, employees' opinion to remain in their organization is based mainly on their sense of commitment to their employers. Other reasons include personal level status, remuneration, seniority and other benefits that employees acquired from their organization that contributed to their career growth. Thus, career growth can be seen as a great predictor of continuance commitment. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, gaining new skills at the current job has the potential to create continuance commitment. When organizations provide opportunities for skill acquisition, it builds exit barriers. Thus, employees consider continuing in their present organization. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed for this study: Hypothesis 2: There is a significant relationship between career growth and continuance commitment in the Omani public sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career growth and normative commitment.</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref>, normative commitment refers to the employee's psychological attachment to the organization based on either socialization experiences that emphasize the appropriateness of remaining loyal or a moral obligation to repay the organization for benefits received. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref>, normative commitment indirectly influences an affective commitment to some relational variables, such as employee satisfaction, solidarity and participation in decision making and employee trust in the firm. Hence, the normative commitment as a mind-set of obligation is worthy of continuing investigation, as this is different from the mindset of desire <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref>, being faithful to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref> and the individual's sense of obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[125]</ref>. Therefore, from the discussion above, researchers propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3: There is a significant relationship between career growth and normative commitment in the Omani public sector. Career growth and turnover intention. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[126]</ref>, when the employee seeks an opportunity for career growth, he or she has a high expectation from the employer. Therefore, the degree of remaining within the same organization depends on how the employer has met their desire of career growth. Conversely, if the organization fails to meet its employees' career growth expectations, it drives employees to seek opportunities elsewhere, which may be more suitable for their employment expectations. The literature indicates a positive relationship between career growth and organizational commitment and a negative relationship with the turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">126]</ref>. On the contrary, failure to provide career growth opportunities would result in employees-particularly the talented ones-searching for opportunities elsewhere that is more attractive. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, there is a negative association between turnover and promotion plus salary growth. This research aims to examine closely and look at the high predictors of career growth factors' effect on turnover intention that may help to explain further the connection among them. Thus, the following hypothesis was set: Hypothesis 4: Career growth is negatively associated with turnover intention in the Omani public sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational commitment and turnover intention.</head><p>There are numerous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[127]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[129]</ref>, which reported that organizational commitment is connected closely to turnover intention. The employees' intention for leaving the organization is considered based on their personal attachment to the organization; it is less likely for those who have a higher attachment to their organization. This research will focus on exploring the strongest link with turnover intention. So, the following hypotheses would propose: Hypothesis 5: There is a significant negative relationship between affective commitment and turnover intention in Omani's public sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 6:</head><p>There is a significant negative relationship between continuance commitment and turnover intention in Omani's public sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 7:</head><p>There is a significant negative relationship between normative commitment and turnover intention in Omani's public sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating role of organizational commitment.</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[126]</ref>, the reason behind individuals' high sense of duty regarding their vocation/occupation will expect more from their organization and how much those desires are met will determine their work relationship. Studies carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[130]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[131]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[132]</ref> indicated that organizational commitment affects turnover intention more negatively than career growth. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref>, the relationship between the component of affective commitment and turnover intention is a negatively related. In this case, this research will examine whole commitment components, including affective occupational commitment and turnover intentions. This study aims to examine the relationship between career growth and turnover intention as well as to examine the mediating role of organizational commitment. So, the following hypothesis would propose: Hypothesis 8: Affective commitment mediates the relationship between career growth and turnover intentions.</p><p>Hypothesis 9: Continuance commitment mediates the relationship between career growth and turnover intentions.</p><p>Hypothesis 10: Normative commitment mediates the relationship between career growth and turnover intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposed conceptual framework</head><p>Based on the above discussion, the following conceptual framework is proposed (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The research has both dependent and independent variables and mediator variables, as shown in the figure below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability and validity analysis for Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>Validity. For discriminant validity, CFA was conducted for career goal progresses, professional ability development, promotion speed, remuneration growth, affective commitment, continuance commitment, normative commitment and employee turnover intention. To achieve the discriminant validity, this study runs the measurement model by linking all the exogenous and endogenous constructs to examine whether these constructs are highly correlated. In the case where the measure of correlation between two constructs is higher than 0.85, one could conclude that the discriminant validity is not achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">134]</ref>. If the discriminant validity is not achieved, then the researchers need to drop one of those two constructs for further analysis since it mirrors the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[135]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> indicates that none of the exogenous constructs' correlation is higher than 0.85. Thus, it is assumed that the discriminant validity is achieved.</p><p>Reliability. Reliability analysis using Cronbach's Alpha needs to be conducted in factor analysis, as it enables measuring the internal consistency of variables grouped in each factor <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265535.g001">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265535.g001</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[136]</ref>. The value of Cronbach's Alpha should be as close as possible to 1.0 or reasonably, between 0.7 and 1.0. A higher number indicates a higher correlation among the variables in the model. As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the Cronbach's Alpha value for all 31 items is 0.822 and greater than 0.7 for each of the factors or constructs. This indicates the significance of the model used in the analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[137]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> summarizes the fulfillment of unidimensionality,  reliability and validity requirements for the CFA analysis. The CFA results passed the unidimensionality, validity as well as reliability tests and allowed for further analysis.</p><p>It is important to note that Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Composite Reliability (CR) are vital components that measure the convergent validity and composite reliability of the CFA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">134]</ref>. However, one of the limitations of AMOS software is that it cannot calculate AVE and CR.

In this study, none of the constructs violated the assumption of normality as all the values of skewness were less than three, which were positively or negatively skewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Besides, for kurtosis, all the values should be less than seven to prove that there is no abnormal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[135]</ref>. All the kurtosis values in this study are less than five, proving that no single case falls in the abnormal distribution. Furthermore, from the output, the outliers were checked, and no observation was found on the Mahalanobis is distance (observations farthest from the centroid), presented in S1 Appendix.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">140]</ref>, it is obvious that the values in the p2 column are always smaller compared to column p1. If the value in p1 column is smaller than p2 column, then the issue of outlier will exist. In this study, none of the values in p1 column were smaller than p2 column. This justifies the use of CFA analysis in this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modelling</head><p>Over the past few years, SEM has become a prevalent statistical techniques in research. In the past, SEM was mostly used by the specialist. However, due to the introduction of new SEM software that proves the user's graphical user-interface, it is easy to use. The main advantage of SEM is flexibility; it proves the researcher with the ability to test a theoretical and measurement assumption against empirical data statistically. With the use of SEM, social scientists can now perform path analytical modelling with the use of latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref>. It is important to highlight that SEM allows for the integration of unobserved (known as latent) variables with the observed ones and identifies structural causal links that arise between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref>). Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[141]</ref> stated that SEM is a confirmatory method, which means that the approach focuses on the hypothesis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct 1: Career growth</head><p>The first construct identified in this study is career growth.

This study has confirmed that career growth is one of the most important issues influencing employee  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). This means that employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman are encouraged to go for training regularly to ensure that their knowledge is current and related to their job. On the other hand, the item "My promotion speed in the present organization is fast" has achieved the lowest mean average of 1.5957 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). This shows that most of the employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman are not happy with the promotion speed. This statistical information leads us to believe that these sub-constructs are among the main components, which determine career growth. This finding is consistent with past findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>, where the authors have identified these dimensions to measure career growth.

This also confirms that all the career growth sub constructs (career goal progresses, professional ability development, promotion speed and remuneration growth) represents the actual constructs. Though the factor loading between career growth (CG) and promotion speed (PS) is low, 0.264, it is statistically significant to be included in the model.

Thirteen items were adapted to measure the sub-constructs of organizational commitment. Affective commitment and continuance commitment were measured by four items each, the normative commitment was measured by five items. The item "I do not feel any obligation to remain with my current employer" has achieved the highest mean average of 3.9289 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). This means that employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman are not satisfied with their current jobs. Therefore, they do not feel any obligation to remain in the organization. This was also supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, who have, in an in-depth qualitative study, suggested diminished normative commitment. This is possibly due to the defaulted values of Islamic obligation and loyalty being challenged where autocracy thwarts trust from subordinates to superiors.</p><p>On the other hand, the item "I do not feel a strong sense of belonging to my organization" has achieved the lowest average mean score of 1.1884 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). This shows that majority of the employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman do not agree with this statement, as they prefer to work in their current organization. This is because they feel their current organization as their home and are currently happy with their career growth and future opportunities.

The item "For me, this company is the best of all possible organizations to work for" has achieved the highest mean average of 3.8906 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). This means that employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman are satisfied with their current jobs. On the other hand, the item "I am very likely to stay in this company for the next five years" has achieved the lowest average mean score of 3.245 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). This shows that majority of the employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman still prefer to work in their current organization though it scored the lowest mean average among other items. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a recent increase in pay in the public sector played a vital role in retaining the organisation's current employees.

The first criterion is the Absolute Fit category, where Root Mean Square Residuals (RMSEA) and ChiSq/df were used. The second category is the Incremental Fit, where the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) was considered. Finally, in the Parsimonious Fit category, this study has selected the Parsimony Normed Fit Index (PNFI). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[138]</ref>, in the case of the CFI, the closer the value is to 1, the better the fit of the model. In addition to this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[145]</ref> has mentioned that when the value is more than 0.90, it signifies an adequate fit to the data.

Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[148]</ref> found that employees can give discretionary effort as well as have a greater impact on the performance and effectiveness of organizational strategies if they have been motivated as skilled and knowledgeable people to achieve their tasks. Normative commitment as an obligation may not induce greater effort voluntarily but perhaps may contribute to inertia and indifference to the organization. This essentially is not normative commitment. Interestingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> suggest that cultural factors may contribute to inertial effects, as they discovered normative commitment or sense of obligation owing to Islamic values in Omani organizations. A past study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref> has found that normative commitment is an obligation deriving from the personality of the employee and the personal value resulting from that feeling of obligation to remain in the organization. Hence, it refers to a mindset of obligation rather than the mindset of desire <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref>. Normative commitment plays a role to keep employees in the same organization due to their own sense of obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[125]</ref>.

Career growth was found to be an insignificant predictor of employee turnover intention, but when Organizational commitment was included in the equation as a mediator, career growth became significant. This indicated that career growth's role is pivotal in relation to organizational commitment. Therefore, the positive relationship between career growth and turnover intention infers that when employees are given sufficient support in their personal development and growth, they perceive themselves as more marketable and employable in other organizations.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref>, if all the relationships are statistically significant, then it can be assumed that there is a partial mediation. However, if the direct relationship becomes insignificant when mediators are included in the model, then it signifies a full mediation. In this case, to confirm the types of mediation (full or partial), this study has tested the relationship presented in Fig <ref type="figure">9</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">13</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H9: Continuance Commitment Mediates the Relationship between Career Growth and Turnover Intentions</head><p>The findings are also similar to past findings.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion and recommendations</head><p>This study at hand aimed at exploring the relationship between career growth and organizational commitment, and whether, affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment mediates the relationship between career growth and employee turnover intention among the employees working in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman. The results indicate that career growth is very essential element that motivates employees' turnover intention in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman. In addition, the findings also confirm that affective and continuance except normative commitment significantly mediates the relationship between career growth and employee turnover intention. According to this study, the public sector in Oman failed to retain talented employees due to two main interconnected reasons: the lack of a clear career program by the employers that lead to the lack of strong organizational commitment among employees. This study provided significant insights in identifying career growth by utilizing the four components as a second-order that influence employee turnover intention in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman. Furthermore, this study has also identified the key dimensions of organizational commitment (e.g. affective, continuance and normative commitment) that mediate the relationship between career growth and employee turnover intention. The findings of this research have confirmed that affective and continuance commitment are the key factors that mediate career growth and employees' turnover intention relationship in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman context. However, the findings on the relationship between career growth and turnover intentions and the relationship between normative commitment and turnover intention were found to be statistically not significant (p&gt;.05), specifically from the Omani perspective. This finding should be  taken seriously by managers because employees who have the low commitment and thus high turnover intention are not likely to feel compelled to commit and give all their efforts to the organizations. Any new building of career growth of the organization's employees or any initiative that aims to retain employees must first address the need to increase employees' commitment to the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>This study is theoretically significant for the field of Organizational Behavior (OB) as it has contributed to a theoretical enhancement of the current level of knowledge in the existing literature on OB. The mediating role of organizational between career growth and turnover intention were considered an extension of what <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref> have stated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref> examined affective commitment as a single component of organizational commitment. Consequently, this creates the necessity for a complete examination of all organizational commitment components. This study filled this gap by adding two more variables in organizational commitment, namely continuance commitment and normative commitment; which have been accounted as a major contribution to organizational commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological implications</head><p>This study has proposed a measurement tool through which career growth and organizational commitment and turnover intention can be measured. This study provides a valid and reliable instrument that can measure the relationship between career growth, organizational commitment and turnover intention. This could contribute significantly to the methodological development for HRM research. In addition, this study could help explore the organizational and individual factors to shed more light on what individuals and organizations can do to facilitate the growth of careers. The results of this analysis will help organizations to learn from the survey-based case study and apply major findings from the study into their own settings and hence improve their employee relations practices and provide insights for future growth in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical implications</head><p>Empirically, this research seeks to evaluate the mediating role of organizational commitment (affective, continuance and normative commitment) between the relationship career growth (career goal progresses, professional ability development, promotion speed and remuneration growth) as sub-construct and employee turnover intention. Firstly, a total of five variables were identified in this study, they include one independent variable (career growth), three mediating variables (affective, continuance and normative commitment) as well as one dependent variable (employee turnover intention). Secondly, this study has significantly contributed to the development of HRM theory on career growth, organizational commitment and turnover intention. This study was undertaking empirical testing of the structural relationships among the study factors. This systematic examination of structural relationships among the constructs has facilitated a clearer understanding of the nature of the employee turnover intention from the career growth and organizational commitment view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>This research has practical significance as currently a very limited number of studies have been conducted on the issue specifically focused on the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">110]</ref>). Current research enables a superior understanding of the factors behind the turnover intention that the public administration in the Gulf countries in general and Omani public administration faces in particular. This study will help achieve the overall research of turnover goals, and the result may be generalized to similar countries. Therefore, its resulting indications could help both researchers and those involved in public sector policy to understand how employee turnover intention is influenced by career growth and organizational commitment in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman. Besides, this research finding will contribute to further development of the Oman public sector HRM policy and those associated with it. Thus, to conclude, this research expects to create a working awareness of the factors that promote or deter career growth and organizational commitment among individuals and organizations in the public sector in Oman. The results from this research will help practitioners to manage human resources and appreciate individual differences factors in career growth and organizational commitment to reduce turnover. Managers in the Omani public sector must take these findings seriously because employees who have a low commitment and high turnover intention are not likely to feel compelled to commit and give all their efforts to the organizations. The most important conclusion of this research is that while building career growth programs aimed at increasing the employee retention, key factor that needs to be addressed is the employees' commitment to the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the study and future direction</head><p>In this study, the data collection was challenging as the respondents were employees working in the Omani public sector. As such, accessing the right respondents was very challenging. Furthermore, identifying the right respondent was also very difficult as this study only considered those employees with three or more years of working experience. Hence, the researchers had to ask every single respondent who was available during the data collection, whether they have more than three years of work experiences or not. Nevertheless, the empirical model was found to have a good fit based on the data gathered from the respondents.</p><p>As information regarding the current HRM practices in Oman is not readily available, Omani public organizations need to publicize their success stories on their websites or in the newspapers, helping them to find out the best practices in the coming future. Besides, this study also proposes to replicate the process into the private sector in the future and see whether a significant difference exists between the public and private sectors. Finally, an investigation of the impact of employees' demographic variables such as gender, age, job title and education level as mediating variables is likely to provide a better understanding of the relationship. The scopes of unexplained variance indicate that factors not included in the framework of the study might be important to consider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution and originality value of the study</head><p>This study aims to extend the relationship between career growth and turnover intention by using model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This model has proposed four main constructs of Organizational Career growth, viz., career goal progress, professional ability development, promotion speed and remuneration growth. However, in this study, career growth in the Omani public sector was explored by examining the relationship between the dependent variable of turnover intention via a mediating viable of commitment that could lead to fuller rational explanations of their inherent connections practically among the public sector's employees in the Sultanate of Oman. Therefore, this field study is an applied extension from actual organizational field data from theoretical, methodological and actual field research standpoint.</p><p>The main purpose of this study was to examine organizational commitment (affective, continuance and normative based on Meyer and Allen's 1991 model) as mediating variables between career growth and turnover intention in the Omani public sector. In the process, firstly, researchers placed turnover intention as a dependent variable by using career growth directly as an independent variable and also organizational commitment components as independents (affective, normative and continuance commitment). Secondly, mediating organizational commitment components, it enabled a superior understanding of the factors behind the turnover intention that the public administration, in the Gulf countries in general and in Omani public administration in particular, actually faces. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> conducted a qualitative study in Oman, and it appears that organizational commitment is a major theme that has indicated diminished normative commitment. Consequently, this reinforces the need for further exploratory testing of all three components of organizational commitment quantitatively.</p><p>In this context, this study helps to achieve the overall research of the causes of turnover, and the result may be generalizable to similar countries. Therefore, its resulting indications could help both researchers and those involved in public sector policy to understand how employee's turnover intention is influenced by career growth and organizational commitment in the public sector of the Sultanate of Oman.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.

According to<ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[150]</ref>, employees in their current organization have gained many things, such as training and development, reducing attrition. A study conducted by<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> has found a positive relationship between continuance commitment and career growth. However,<ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[151]</ref> found that continuance commitment is negatively associated with employee turnover intention. Thus, this study accepts Hypothesis Nine that continuance commitment mediates the relationship between career growth and turnover intention.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head>Fig 11</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig 11 shows the mediating effect of normative commitment between career growth and turnover intentions. It explains the goodness-of-fit indices (GOF) values that have been attained from the model for this study. It indicates that the fitness indices for the SEM model have been achieved [Absolute fit (RMSEA) = .048, (ChiSq/df) = 1.752; Incremental fit (CFI) = .951; and Parsimonious fit (PNFI) = .788]. To confirm the types of mediation (full or partial mediation), this study has tested the relationship presented in Fig 11 and Table15. It can be observed that the relationship between normative commitment and career growth is statistically significant, with a path value of positive .70. The relationship between career growth and turnover intention is also statistically significant, with a negative path value of .61. However, the relationship between normative commitment and turnover intention is not statistically significant, with a negative path value of .15 (p � 0.05). Hence, this indicates that normative commitment does not mediate the relationship between career growth and turnover intention in the model. This also answers research question number ten which is "Does normative commitment mediate between career growth and turnover intention?".In the past, it was found that career growth is related to employees' behaviors and attitudes that can bring about turnover intention if career development is not managed accurately.<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> explained that career growth is negatively correlated to turnover intention. Furthermore,<ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">130]</ref> found that normative commitment negatively affects turnover intention rather than career growth. Meyer further supported these findings, as well as<ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref>, who pointed out that normative commitment is the mindset of obligation rather than the mindset of desire. Thus, this study rejects Hypothesis 10 that normative commitment mediates the relationship between career growth and turnover intentions.</figDesc><graphic coords="27,200.01,78.01,288.00,191.74" type="bitmap" /></figure>
