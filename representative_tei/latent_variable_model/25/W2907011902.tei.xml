<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Body size plays a key role in the ecology and evolution of all organisms. Therefore, quantifying the sources of morphological (co)variation, dependent and independent of body size, is of key importance when trying to understand and predict responses to selection. We combine structural equation modeling with quantitative genetics analyses to study morphological (co)variation in a meta-population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). As expected, we found evidence of a latent variable 'body size', causing genetic and environmental covariation between morphological traits.</p><p>Estimates of conditional evolvability show that allometric relationships constrain the independent evolution of house sparrow morphology. We also found spatial differences in general body size and its allometric relationships. On islands where birds are more dispersive and mobile, individuals were smaller and had proportionally longer wings for their body size. While in islands where sparrows are more sedentary and nest in dense colonies, individuals were larger and had proportionally longer tarsi for their body size. We corroborated these results using simulations and show that our analyses produce unbiased allometric slope estimates. This study highlights that in the short term allometric relationships may constrain phenotypic evolution, but that in the long term selection pressures can also shape allometric relationships.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The size of an organism is one of its most important features <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Calder 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Peters 1986</ref>) and has been extensively studied in both micro-and macro-evolutionary contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Maurer et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kingsolver and Pfennig 2004)</ref>. Across species, body size predicts characteristics such as metabolism, fecundity, lifespan, population size and extinction risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stearns 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sibly and Brown 2007)</ref>. Within species body size has also been shown to affect key fitness components, such as fecundity, survival and mating success <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kingsolver and Pfennig 2004)</ref>. Body size variation withinand among-species can therefore determine population and community level processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Marquet et al. 1995)</ref>. Despite its importance in ecological and evolutionary processes, body size is generally loosely defined. In many studies, body size is used interchangeably with body mass or other morphological measurement, ignoring the fact that body size is being measured indirectly through a proxy morphometric measurement (e.g. body mass, tarsus length, snout-vent length). Here, we argue that studying body size variation as a latent variable affecting the growth of all other morphological traits will improve our understanding of its evolutionary role in shaping morphological diversity.</p><p>From a developmental perspective, body size reflects the common growth regulatory mechanisms affecting all morphological structures of an organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gokhale and Shingleton 2015)</ref>, whereas from an evolutionary perspective it reflects investment in somatic growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Perrin and Sibly 1993)</ref>. Thus, variation in body size can be viewed as variation in investment in somatic growth affecting all morphological traits through shared growth regulating pathways, resulting in the allometric patterns of morphological covariation observed in most organisms. This notion emerged early in evolutionary thinking with Darwin's consideration of the "correlations of growth", in which he noted that slight evolutionary variation in one part of an organism would result in other parts also being modified accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Darwin 1859)</ref>. The study of morphological covariation and its evolutionary implications has continued ever since within the fields of allometry, phenotypic integration, modularity and evolutionary quantitative genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klingenberg 2008)</ref>. Common to all these fields is the idea that genetic and environmental variation influencing investment in growth during development shape the observed patterns of morphological covariation among individuals, populations, and species.</p><p>Phenotypes develop in a hierarchical manner and the covariation between morphological traits partly reflects this hierarchical pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Klingenberg 2014)</ref>. All traits descend from the same ancestral cell, and developmental switch-points create phenotypic modules composed of traits that share the same developmental precursor <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(West-Eberhard 2003)</ref>. For instance, in birds genetic variation in the processes regulating early developmental events concerning the muscles and skeleton will cause positive covariation between all morphological traits. Therefore, bigger birds are heavier, have larger beaks, wings and legs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Björklund 1994)</ref>. Later on, processes leading to beak development start at around day 6 of embryo development, (e.g. Darwin's finches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abzhanov et al. 2004</ref>). The different parts of the beak thus share a common developmental history with all other morphological traits, but they also share a more recent developmental precursor with any other traits specifically associated with the beak. This should lead to an even stronger pattern of correlation between beak features, caused by the processes regulating beak development. This developmental view of morphological covariation hinges upon the assumption that variation is generated from a single origin and passed on to multiple traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klingenberg 2008)</ref>. More generally, the modular patterns of covariation between morphological traits will also reflect their common ontogenetic and evolutionary histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Melo et al. 2016)</ref>. The independent evolution of phenotypic traits arising from the same developmental module is constrained, at least in the short term, by developmental ancestry <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wagner and Stadler 2003)</ref>. However, the structure of these developmental modules will also have come into being via evolution through natural selection over a longer time frame. Therefore, developmental modules will have been selected to couple or decouple variation in different morphological traits, depending upon the prevailing adaptive landscape.</p><p>Selection for a larger body size will result in selection for an increase in the size of all morphological traits. Similarly, selection for increased size in one trait can lead to an increase in the overall size of an organism. For instance, selection for bigger beaks could lead to bigger birds in general, because bigger birds have bigger beaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grant and Grant 2002)</ref>. Selective pressures can also affect size-independent variation in morphological traits, altering allometric relationships with body size. For example, there could be selection for smaller beaks relative to overall body size, if there is antagonistic selection where smaller beaks increase foraging success, but smaller birds suffer a competitive disadvantage during agonistic interactions. Statistically partitioning the (co)variance in morphological traits caused by body size from those independent of body size would allow us to connect the multivariate study of morphological evolution with the developmental processes that generate morphological variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Klingenberg 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, disentangling the genetic and environmental sources of size-dependent and size-independent (co)variation between morphological traits will provide further insights concerning how evolution shapes the genetic and phenotypic patterns of morphological covariation.</p><p>Allometric relationships between body size and any morphological trait can be described as a power function <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Huxley 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Peters 1986)</ref> and have been commonly estimated as the linear relationship between log-transformed measurements of a trait and a surrogate measure of body size.</p><p>The accuracy of the allometric slopes estimated using such surrogate measurements will depend upon the correlation between the proxy measure and body size. If we define body size as investment in somatic growth through common growth-regulating mechanisms affecting all morphological traits, each of the surrogate measures of body size will also contain some variation caused by factors that are not shared with all the other morphological measurements (i.e. size-independent variation). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jolicoeur (1963)</ref> offered a solution to this problem: run a principal component analysis (PCA) on the covariance matrix of log-transformed measurements and use the resulting first principal component as the estimate of the common allometric axis (body size). In this framework, the allometric slopes can be characterized in relationship to the axis of best-fit in the multivariate space of log-transformed measurements. A similar approach has been suggested using factor analyses, where body size is explicitly estimated as a latent variable affecting the (co)variation of morphological traits. Structural equation modeling (SEM) provides a general set of models that include factor analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grace et al. 2010)</ref>. SEM can be used to both determine the variation in morphological traits caused by the effects of body size, and to estimate specific additional (co)variation in morphological traits unrelated to body size (e.g. beak measures co-varying independently of body size). An SEM approach to quantifying size-dependent and size-independent genetic and environmental (co)variation in morphological traits makes it possible to study the multivariate nature of morphological traits in a framework that is consistent with allometric, developmental and evolutionary theory.</p><p>In this study, we combine quantitative genetic analyzes with SEM to study morphological (co)variation in a house sparrow (Passer domesticus) metapopulation. We explore (co)variation in beak depth, beak length, body mass, tarsus length and wing length in over 5000 house sparrows using data collected from 1994 to 2014 in 11 island populations. We first quantify genetic and environmental sources of (co)variation in house sparrow morphological measurements. We then use SEMs to study the covariance between morphological measurements caused by body size and estimate the allometric slopes generating the observed pattern of covariation. Our expectation was that common growth regulatory mechanisms shared by all the morphological traits will result in a pattern of genetic and environmental covariation, which could be characterized statistically as a latent variable, defined as 'body size'. We then quantify the amount of size-independent variance in the different morphological traits, which determines their potential for independent evolution. We also estimate size-independent covariance between beak features, with the expectation that a more recent shared developmental history will result in additional genetic and environmental covariation above and beyond the general allometric covariation caused by body size variation.</p><p>We complement our analyses with simulations to assess the suitability of SEM to estimate allometric slopes from a biological model where body size causes covariation between all the measured morphological traits, and we compare it with commonly used alternative approaches (bivariate regression and PCA). We also describe how to derive key evolutionary parameters using this approach, such as scaled allometric slopes and conditional evolvabilities. Furthermore, house sparrows are sexually dimorphic and sex-specific patterns of morphological covariation have been documented in this meta-population <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jensen et al. 2003)</ref>. Ecological conditions also vary consistently between the islands in our metapopulation. Previous studies on this metapopulation have documented differences in several demographic traits related to island characteristics: adult and juvenile survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ringsby et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Holand et al. 2016)</ref>, survival and growth rate <ref type="bibr">(Saether et al. 1999)</ref>, onset of breeding and subsequent recruitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ringsby et al. 2002)</ref>, population growth rate, demographic variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Engen et al. 2007)</ref>, and dispersal <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pärn et al. 2012)</ref>. We therefore also assess the sex differences and the effect of differing ecological conditions on the morphology of these house sparrows to explore the extent to which selection may have shaped the allometric relationships in different parts of this metapopulation of house sparrows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study system</head><p>This study was carried out on a metapopulation of 11 insular house sparrow populations at Helgeland in northern Norway (66°N 13°E; see map <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baalsrud et al. 2014)</ref>). Each time an adult bird was caught, we used slide calipers to measure tarsus length, bill depth and bill length to the nearest 0.01 mm, and a wing ruler to measure wing length to the nearest mm. Body mass was measured using a Pesola spring balance to the nearest 0.1 g. All linear morphological measurements (except body mass) that were taken by different fieldworkers were adjusted to T.H.R. measurements by adding mean differences when found significant (P &lt; 0.05) using paired t-tests on a set of ca. 30 individual birds measured independently by the fieldworker and T.H.R <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kvalnes et al. 2018)</ref>. All birds in the current study were adult males (n=2866) or females (n=2716) measured between 1994 and 2014. 32% of the individuals were only measured once as adults, 20% were measured twice, and 48% three or more times in the same or different years (see <ref type="bibr">Harald et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jensen et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Parn et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baalsrud et al. 2014</ref> for further details on the fieldwork). We used all the repeated measures to separate out measurement error and within-individual variation from the among-individual variation (see below). Population-specific genetic pedigrees were constructed based upon 14 neutral microsatellite markers (for further details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jensen et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Billing et al. 2012)</ref>. Individuals were genotyped for only 8 (Aldra, Gjerøy, Hestmanøy, Indre Kvarøy, Myken, Nesøy, Selvaer, and Traena) out of the 11 populations, thus the quantitative genetic analyses were limited to 3940 individuals.</p><p>The 11 islands in this metapopulation study can be divided into two distinct groups with different environmental conditions. One set of inner islands (n = 6; Aldra, Gjerøy, Hestmanøy, Indre Kvarøy, Lurøy, and Nesøy), are situated closer to the mainland and the sparrow populations live closely associated with active dairy farms with access to cattle-food and shelter all year round (17345 measurements from 3530 individuals). The second set of outer islands (n = 5; Lovund, Myken, Selvaer, Sleneset, and Traena), are situated further from the mainland, lack agricultural farms and sparrows move around feeding in various gardens (7512 measurements from 2065 individuals). On these outer islands the sparrows are exposed to more unpredictable and fluctuating environmental conditions. Thus, adults on populations on the inner farm islands experience a seemingly more benign and predictable environment than in populations on the outer non-farm islands. Throughout the manuscript we refer to these two groups as inner farm islands and outer non-farm islands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Univariate analyses</head><p>We first studied the sources of variation in the different morphological measurements (tarsus length, wing length, beak length, beak depth and body mass). Morphological trait 𝑧 of individual 𝑗 at instance 𝑘 was modeled as: 𝑧 𝑗𝑘 = 𝑐 + 𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑥 𝑗 + 𝑡 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 𝑗 + 𝑑 𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑗𝑘 + 𝐼 𝑗 + 𝑓 𝑙 + 𝑚 𝑡 + 𝑦 𝑚 + 𝑒 𝑗𝑘 .</p><p>(eq. 1)</p><p>Coefficients 𝑠 and 𝑑 relate the morphological measurement to the sex and the age of the individual, and 𝑡 to the island type (inner-farm islands versus outer-non-farm islands). Individuals differ in their morphological measurements (𝐼 𝑗 ) due to genetic differences and permanent environmental effects, as well as environmental effects associated with population differences (fl). Individuals</p><p>were measured repeatedly within and across years, therefore within-individual variation could be associated with reversible plasticity in response to within year seasonal variation (i.e. across months; mt), yearly variation in environmental conditions (ym) and within year within individual variation in environmental conditions and or measurement error, ejk. Parameters Ij, fl, mt, ym and ejk were all assumed to come from normal distributions with means of zero and variances to be estimated (VI, Vf, Vm, Vy and Ve). These parameters were estimated using separate mixed-effects models for each of the morphological measurements, with age and age-squared as fixed covariates (min age = 1, max age = 10) to model the linear and non-linear effects of age, with sex as a fixed factor (2 levels) and random intercepts for year of measurement (21 years), month of measurement (12 months), population (11 populations) and individual identity (5582 individuals). We extended this model to an animal model by including the genetic pedigree information <ref type="bibr">(Kruuk 2004)</ref>. This allowed us to partition the individual level effects, 𝐼 𝑗 , into the additive genetic effects (breeding value) 𝑎 𝑗 and permanent environmental effects 𝑝𝑒 𝑗 for each morphological trait. Both 𝑎 𝑗 and 𝑝𝑒 𝑗 were assumed to come from normal distributions with variances 𝑉 𝑎 and 𝑉 𝑝𝑒 . Note that this model was applied to only a subset of the data where the pedigree information was available (3924 individuals from eight islands).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivariate analyses</head><p>When studying the covariation between all the morphological traits, we log-transformed the morphological measurements so that their expected exponential relationship with body size becomes linear. We first studied the phenotypic covariance and modeled each log-transformed morphological trait 𝑧 𝑖 of individual 𝑗 at measurement 𝑘 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝑐 𝑖 + 𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑥 𝑗 + 𝐼 𝑖𝑗 + 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑘 , (eq. 2)</formula><p>where 𝑐 𝑖 is the metapopulation mean for the morphological trait 𝑖, 𝐼 𝑖𝑗 is the deviation of morphological trait 𝑖 of individual 𝑗 from the metapopulation mean 𝑐 𝑖 , and 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑘 is the deviation of measurement 𝑘 from an individual's mean value 𝐼 𝑖𝑗 . Parameters 𝐼 𝑖𝑗 and 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑘 were assumed to be a realization of multinormal distribution with a mean of zero and covariance matrix 𝐏 and 𝐑. These parameters were estimated using a multivariate mixed-effects model with random intercepts for individual identity (n=5582 individuals). We chose not to fit the same random and fixed effect structure for the multivariate and univariate models in order to avoid over-parametrization, because the main goal of this analysis was to estimate the among-individual covariation matrix (P matrix).</p><p>We extended this multivariate mixed-effects model into an animal model by including the genetic pedigree information <ref type="bibr">(Kruuk 2004)</ref>. This model allowed us to partition the individual level covariance matrix (P matrix) into its additive genetic (𝐆 matrix) and the permanent environmental (𝐏𝐄 matrix) components. The P matrix describes the (co)variation between the mean values of each individual for the different morphological traits. The G matrix describes the (co)variation between morphological traits caused by pleiotropic effect of genes and linkage disequilibrium. The PE matrix describes the (co)variation between the morphological measurements caused by the effects early in life of correlated environmental variables and environmental variables with pleiotropic effects on the different traits. Thus, the PE matrix can be understood as the integrated developmental plasticity of the different morphological traits in response to the environment. These estimated covariance matrices were then analyzed using structural equation models (SEMs). Note that we also estimated the residual covariance matrix (𝐑 matrix), which is caused by correlated reversible plasticity and/or correlated measurement error, but this covariance matrix was not further analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modeling and body size</head><p>Allometric theory states that the effects of body size (m) on a phenotypic trait z can be described by an exponential relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Huxley 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Peters 1986</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑧 = 𝑎𝑚 𝑏 . (eq. 3)</formula><p>The relationship between body size and a phenotypic trait is linear on the logarithmic scale and can thus be described by equation 4:</p><p>log(𝑧 𝑖𝑗 ) = log(𝑎 𝑖 ) + 𝑏 𝑖 log(𝑚 𝑗 ) + log (𝑒 𝑖𝑗 ) , (eq. 4)</p><p>where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are constants that relate a body size 𝑚 to a phenotypic measurement 𝑧. This equation captures the proportional change in phenotypic measures as a function of proportional changes in body size. 𝑏 is commonly referred to as the allometric slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Peters 1986</ref>). The term log (𝑒 𝑖𝑗 )</p><p>reflects the residual effects of factors not related to body size that are unique to the different morphological measurements. Thus, this model assumes multiplicative errors. Based upon this equation, we proceeded to examine the P matrix as well as the G and PE matrices using SEM to test our hypothesized model of morphological covariation. We expected that a latent variable 𝑚, that we defined as body size, would explain the covariance between all measured morphological traits (equation 5). This approach estimates the vector of coefficients 𝛾 𝑖 , that maximize the likelihood of a covariance matrix, in this case P, G and 𝐏𝐄 matrices. For instance, the structural equation model for 𝐏 can be described as: 𝐏 = 𝛾 𝑖 𝜂 + 𝜀 𝑖 (eq. 5)</p><p>𝜂~𝑁(0, 1)</p><p>𝜀 𝑖 ~𝑚𝑣𝑛(0, 𝜃) .</p><p>Thus, our hypothesized model consisted of a latent variable 𝜂 that determines the growth of morphological trait 𝑧 𝑖 proportional to coefficient 𝛾 𝑖 . We assumed that the latent variable 𝜂 had a mean of zero and a variance of 1. Deviations of each morphological trait from values predicted by the latent variable are represented by 𝜀 𝑖 , which was assumed to be a realization of a multi-normal distribution with a mean of zero and covariance matrix θ. The 𝛉 matrix thus represents body sizeindependent variation and covariation between morphological traits. Our hypothesized model was constructed to allow all the variances in the 𝛉 matrix and one covariance to be estimated.</p><p>Specifically, because of their more recent shared developmental history and functional relationship, we hypothesized a covariance between beak length and beak depth over and above the covariance caused by their allometric relationships with body size. We further proceeded to study the differences in the allometric relationships and evolvabilities between the sexes and between individuals living on different islands with different environmental conditions (i.e. inner farm versus outer non-farm islands) by fitting multivariate models and SEM models separately for each sex and island type.</p></div>

This is generally calculated as a mean standardized additive genetic variance, however additive genetic variance of log-transformed measurements accurately approximates their evolvabilities.</p><p>This metric is thus related to both the additive genetic variance of a trait and its mean value, in comparison to heritabilities that are a direct function not only of the additive genetic variance but also of other (environmental) sources of phenotypic variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hansen et al. 2011)</ref>. We estimated evolvabilities from univariate animal models applied to log-transformed morphological measurements. Conditional evolvabilities were calculated using the variance not explained by body size for each trait. Structural equation models (SEM) were applied to the G matrix of the log-transformed measurements, and therefore variance not explained by body size could be interpreted as conditional evolvabilities. We also estimated autonomy, which in this case is the fraction of additive genetic variance that is unrelated to body size. We further estimated the conditional evolvabilities for the whole G matrix in order to compare them with estimates from the SEM approach (i.e. conditional on body size). Conditional evolvabilities on all the other traits were calculated following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hansen and Houle (2008)</ref>, using the inverse of the G matrix as it is equal to the inverse of the diagonal elements of G -1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulations and the estimation of allometric slopes</head><p>We performed a simulation study to assess the robustness of the SEM approach in recovering a biological developmental model of morphological covariances caused by body size variation (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). We compared the performance of the SEM approach against (1) bivariate regressions between the different log-transformed morphometric measurements and log-transformed body mass, and (2) principal component analyses (PCA) applied to log-scaled morphological measurements. One disadvantage of PCA and other latent variable approaches to estimating body size is that these latent constructs are unitless, and so the coefficients 𝛾 𝑖 (eq. 5) cannot be directly interpreted as allometric slopes (𝑏 𝑖 , eq. 3 and 4). We therefore suggest scaling latent variables of body size to body mass using the allometric relationships estimated in the SEM and PCA. Under the assumption that body size is a volume measure and scales isometrically with body mass (𝑏 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦_𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 = 1), we can derive allometric slopes that capture the proportional changes in a morphological trait associated with a proportional change in body size measured in units of mass <ref type="bibr">(Corrunici 1983)</ref>. Mass-scaled allometric slopes (b) can be estimated by dividing coefficient 𝛾 𝑖 by the estimated 𝛾 for body mass</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(𝑏 𝑖 = 𝛾 𝑖 𝛾 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 ⁄</formula><p>). In the main text, we present how the estimation of the allometric slopes is affected by the magnitude of size-independent variation in body mass. In the Appendix S1, we present code for the simulations and a complete description of the results from the simulation study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General statistical procedures</head><p>We fitted the multivariate mixed-effects models detailed above using a Bayesian framework implemented in R v3.3 (R Core Team 2018) with the package MCMCglmm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hadfield 2010</ref>). We ran 305,000 iterations per model, from which we discarded the initial 5000 (burn in period). Each chain was sampled at an interval of 300 iterations, which resulted in low autocorrelation among thinned samples. Posterior means, 85% and 95% credible intervals were estimated across the thinned samples for the fixed effects, (co)variances and variance ratios (i.e. repeatabilities and heritabilities). When the general goal was to compare between the limits of the posterior distributions of two estimates, we present the 85% credible interval because a lack of overlap is analogous to a p-value lower than 0.05 in the frequentist sense <ref type="bibr">(Payton et al 2003)</ref>. Fixed effect priors were normally distributed and diffuse with a mean of zero and a large variance (100). We explored the sensitivity of the variance-covariance matrix to prior choice; the results presented here correspond to an inverse gamma prior with a scale parameter of 1 and shape of 0.001. Mean values of the posterior distributions were robust to different relatively uninformative priors. The resulting 1000 samples of the posterior-distribution for the covariance matrices 𝐏, 𝐆 or 𝐏𝐄 were then analyzed using SEMs in order to obtain estimates of the credible intervals in each case. However the reported point estimates for each parameter (i.e mean) were obtained from analyzing the mean covariance matrix (𝐏, 𝐆 or 𝐏𝐄). We fitted the SEMs in the R package sem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fox 2006)</ref>. Statistical significance for SEM parameters was assessed by inspecting whether the credible intervals overlapped zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources of morphological variation</head><p>We found that male sparrows have deeper and shorter beaks, as well as longer tarsi and wings, as compared to females; while females were heavier than males (Table <ref type="table">1A</ref>). There were also morphological differences between islands with different ecological characteristics. In the inner islands where birds live more closely associated to farms, sparrows had deeper and longer beaks, were heavier and had longer wings (Table <ref type="table">1A</ref>). Similarly, we found that older birds had deeper and longer beaks, were heavier and had longer wings and tarsi (Table <ref type="table">1A</ref>).</p><p>There were also differences between the traits in the relative contribution of the different variance components (Table <ref type="table">1B</ref>). The proportion of phenotypic variance caused by additive genetic variation ranged from 23% for body mass to 43% for wing length. The proportion of variation associated with permanent environmental effects ranged from 9% for wing length to 60% for tarsus length. Among measurement variation was highest for body mass 49% and smallest for tarsus length 4% (Table <ref type="table">1B</ref>). There was relatively little among-population variation in all the morphological measurements (less than 3%). There was also very little variation among years for all traits (less than 2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body size and size-independent covariation and evolvabilities</head><p>As expected, we found evidence that covariation among the five morphological traits was caused by a latent variable that we define as 'body size' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The existence of this body size latent variable was confirmed at the phenotypic, genetic and permanent environmental levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As hypothesized, we also found that beak length and depth were still positively correlated even after accounting for the effects of body size, although the estimates at the permanent environmental level overlapped zero (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>At the phenotypic and genetic levels, body mass was the measured trait that contained the smallest proportion of size-independent variation (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Thus, body mass has the lowest autonomy in relation to body size (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). At the permanent environmental level, tarsus length contained the smallest proportion of size-independent variation (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Beak length and wing length were the traits that had the largest proportion of size-independent variation at the phenotypic level, and beak length was the trait that had the largest size-independent genetic and permanent environmental variation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Therefore, beak length was the trait with highest autonomy in relation to body size. The trait with the highest unconditional evolvability was body mass (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), but the decrease in evolvability when conditional on body size was also strongest in this trait (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Wing length and beak length had the lowest evolvability, but when conditional on body size these traits did not seem to substantially decrease their potential for evolution (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The was not much difference between estimates of evolvability conditional on all the other traits versus the estimates of evolvability conditional on body size, except for body mass.</p><p>Sex and habitat differences in body size relationships.</p><p>Despite mean morphological differences between the sexes in this meta-population of house sparrows, we found that the allometric relationships were surprisingly similar between males and females (Table <ref type="table">2A</ref>). However, we found that that the proportion of size-independent variation in body mass was greater for females than for males (Table <ref type="table">2B</ref>).</p><p>When examining morphological differences among populations in the two habitat types, we found some interesting differences (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Sparrows on the inner farm islands had proportionally longer tarsi for their body size compared to the birds breeding on the outer islands without farms.</p><p>We also found that sparrows on the outer non-farm islands had proportionally longer wings for their body size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; Table <ref type="table">2A</ref>). When studying the size-independent variance in the different types of islands, we found that size-independent variance in wing length was higher for birds on the farm islands compared with the non-farm islands (Table <ref type="table">2C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of methodology using simulations</head><p>The estimated allometric slopes using the SEM approach were generally unbiased (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In contrast, the allometric slopes estimated using bivariate regressions were underestimated with a bias proportional to the amount of size-independent variation in body mass (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). PCA estimates of the allometric slopes also provided biased estimates (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), the scale of which depended on the differences between traits in the degree of size-independent (co)variation. When the size-independent (co)variance is the same for all the morphological traits, the allometric slopes estimates from the PCA were unbiased (Supplementary material S1). Therefore, SEMs provided the most accurate and unbiased estimates from the simulated data. However, it is important to note that when sample sizes are small, for instance less than 20 individuals, SEM may also provide biased allometric slope estimates (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). Furthermore, to perform the analysis at the genetic level, the required sample sizes are considerably higher in order to properly estimate the additive genetic covariance matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We studied the patterns of (co)variation in five morphological traits of adult house sparrows in a metapopulation in northern Norway from 1994 to 2014 using a quantitative genetic analysis combined with structural equation models. We parametrize a latent variable model to describe the genetic and environmental relationships between body size and the measured morphological traits.</p><p>We compare the allometric relationships between islands with different environmental and demographic characteristics and also between the sexes. Other studies have used SEM in ecological studies of morphology, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Crespi and Bookstein (1989)</ref> used path analysis to study the relationship between morphology and survival in house sparrows, and Morrissey (2014) described how to use these types of models within a quantitative genetics framework. The approach used in this study further shows the potential of using SEM in evolutionary studies of allometry and morphology in three main ways: 1) morphological covariation (e.g. the G-matrix) can be studied in a hypothesis testing framework based upon allometry theory; 2) it provides accurate estimates of allometric relationships under the hypothesis that variation in body size causes covariation between morphological traits; and 3) size-independent variation and covariation can be directly estimated.</p><p>Furthermore, these estimates can be interpreted as conditional evolvabilities, describing the potential for independent responses to selection of each measured trait.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body size and allometric slopes</head><p>Using SEMs within a quantitative genetics framework, we found support for a latent variable that we defined as 'body size' underpinning genetic and environmental morphological covariation. This latent variable captures the shared developmental history that underpins the expression of all the studied morphological traits. Importantly, the allometric vector captured by body size when analyzing genetic covariation is aligned with the direction with highest evolvability <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schluter 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hansen and Houle 2008)</ref>. Selection on body size will thus result in an integrated response of the different morphological traits. Furthermore, the allometric vector captured by analyzing the permanent environmental covariance matrix shows that morphological traits respond plastically to the developmental environment in an integrated fashion. This coordinated response ensures functional coherence <ref type="bibr">(Pigliucci 2001a</ref>) when adjusting to environmental conditions. The analysis of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (the G matrix) thus reflects the allometric constraints on independent trait evolution, but also the correlated adaptive response to previous selective landscapes. Meanwhile, the analysis concerning the permanent environmental (PE) matrix reflects how shared developmental mechanisms mediate environmental variation during development.</p><p>We studied covariation of the log-transformed morphological measures using a latent variable model to estimate the allometric relationships with body size (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). One caveat of using latent variables to estimate allometric relations is that they are unitless. To overcome this problem, we scaled the estimated allometric relations with body size to the estimated relation with body mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Corruccini 1983</ref>). We did this by dividing the estimated relationship between the morphological measurements and the latent variable by the estimated relation with body mass. This makes the allometric relationship between the latent variable and body mass equal to one, and thus reflects the assumption that body mass scales isometrically with body size. Scaling the coefficients in this way improves the interpretability of the allometric coefficients, because the allometric slopes describe the proportional increase in a morphological trait associated with an increase in body size measured in grams. This also facilitates comparisons with allometric slopes estimated via the commonly-used bivariate regression method, depending upon the proxy measure for body size in each instance.</p><p>Using statistical simulations, we show that the SEM approach provides more accurate estimates of the allometric slopes than bivariate regressions and PCA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulations and estimation of allometric slopes</head><p>Our analyses revealed that in this house sparrow meta-population, body mass is the variable that contains the least additional size-independent variation of any morphological measurement (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Therefore, body mass provides a good surrogate measure of body size, as we define it. Despite body mass being the trait that correlated the most with the latent variable body size in our data set, the simulations and the empirical analyzes show that the allometric slopes estimated with bivariate regressions using absolute measured body mass as a surrogate of body size tend to be underestimated <ref type="bibr">(Figs 2 &amp; 3)</ref>. The bivariate regression approach uses the covariance between body mass and morphological trait 𝑧 to calculate the allometric slope 𝑏 𝑧 . The allometric slope is estimated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑏 𝑧 = 𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝑧,𝑏𝑚 𝑉 𝑏𝑚</formula><p>, where 𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝑧,𝑏𝑚 is the covariance between body mass and morphological trait 𝑧, and 𝑉 𝑏𝑚 is the variance in body mass. Importantly, the variance in body mass (𝑉 𝑏𝑚 ) can be attributed to the variance associated body size (𝑉 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 ) plus size-independent variance caused by other sources (𝑉 𝑟𝑏𝑚 ), such as differences in fat storage. Thus, the variance in body mass can be estimated as 𝑉 𝑏𝑚 = 𝑉 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 + 𝑉 𝑟𝑏𝑚 . The bias in the allometric slope 𝑏 𝑧 will thus increase as a function of 𝑉 𝑟𝑏𝑚 𝑉 𝑏𝑚 ⁄ . It is possible to correct for the bias using the reliability index 𝐾 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fuller 1987)</ref>. The reliability index 𝐾 equals 1-𝑉 𝑟𝑏𝑚 𝑉 𝑏𝑚 ⁄ and the corrected allometric slope can be calculated using the formula 𝑏 𝑧 𝐾 ⁄ .</p><p>When we correct the allometric slopes estimated using the bivariate regression on the simulated data it indeed produces unbiased estimates (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>). However, to use the K index to correct the allometric slopes it is necessary to first determine the size-independent variation in body mass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Size-independent variation and evolvabilities</head><p>The approach we implement here explicitly models the causal (i.e. developmental) effects of somatic investment in growth on the measured morphological traits (see eq. 4). Hence, any morphological variation not explained by the latent variable body size can be interpreted as sizeindependent variation (Fig <ref type="table">1,</ref><ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). This is of key importance, because size-independent additive genetic variation determines how selection may shape a single morphological trait without affecting the overall size of the organism. We studied the covariation of log-transformed morphometric measurements in our quantitative genetics and SEM analysis, and therefore the estimated sizeindependent additive genetic variation for each morphological trait can be directly interpreted as a conditional evolvability <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hansen and Houle 2008</ref>). The differences between the raw evolvability and conditional evolvability are a direct measure of the degree to which allometric relationships may constraint the independent evolution of each morphological trait. The reduction in conditional evolvability was largest for body mass, implying that selection on body mass will result in a substantially correlated response in the other measured traits, thus altering the overall size of the organism. In contrast, the reduction in the potential for an evolutionary response in beak length and wing length when controlling for body size was negligible, suggesting that selection acting solely on these traits could have an effect without dramatically affecting the overall body size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Size-independent covariation between beak features.</head><p>Within the SEM framework, it is also possible to model the size-independent correlations explicitly.</p><p>For instance, we expected covariation between beak length and depth after correcting for body size, because of the functional and developmental modularity of beak features. We explicitly modelled this parameter and assessed its statistical significance by inspecting the credible intervals. Beak length and depth were correlated both at the genetic and permanent environmental levels after controlling for the covariance caused by the latent variable body size. Although the credible interval of the permanent environmental correlation overlapped zero slightly (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), this finding corroborates the notion that these two beak measurements reflect a functional module that regulates beak development over and above the more fundamental functional module of body size <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abzhanov et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abzhanov et al. , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lamichhaney et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lundregan et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The SEM approach used in this study explicitly disentangles the common (co)variance between all traits created by variation in body size and thus distinguishes it from the unique (co)variance associated with specific factors affecting each of morphological trait separately. It makes it possible in this case to estimate the amount of size-independent (co)variation between beak features. Size-independent (co)variation is generally estimated by inspecting additional principal components orthogonal to PC1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(William et al. 2005)</ref>. From a biological perspective, it is therefore often difficult to make general statements regarding the meaning of PC2 and its interpretation as 'shape' specifically associated with the traits that load on PC2. Furthermore, the estimation of body size using principal components analyses maybe biased depending upon the differences in sizeindependent variation and covariation between traits, further obscuring the interpretation of PC2</p><p>(see Appendix S2). Therefore, if the goal is to test specific patterns of correlation between traits after correcting for body size, our results suggest that these parameters should be modeled explicitly using SEM instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population differences in allometric relations and size-independent variation</head><p>It has been shown that the inner farm islands differ from the outer non-farm islands in adult and juvenile survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ringsby et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Holand et al. 2016)</ref>, growth rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Saether et al. 1999)</ref>, onset of breeding and subsequent recruitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ringsby et al. 2002)</ref>, demographic variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Engen et al. 2007</ref>) and dispersal <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pärn et al. 2012)</ref>. We also found that individuals in these two types of islands differed in their morphology. Sparrows in the inner-farm islands are generally larger than birds in the outer-non-farm islands (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), probably reflecting consistently higher resource abundance, competition for limited nest sites and possibly greater safety from aerial predators in the farm islands. Interestingly, we also found that sparrows in the outer non-farm islands, where individuals are generally more mobile and dispersive, have proportionally longer wings for their body size, as compared to the more sedentary individuals on the inner farm islands (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Birds on the innerfarm islands also had proportionally longer tarsi for their body size, as compared with the birds in outer-non-farm islands. These differences in allometric relationships between these two types of islands suggest that contrasting environmental conditions may have shaped the allometry of house sparrows in our system. These differences may be caused by differences in the environmental and/or genetic underpinnings of the allometric relationships. We found evidence suggesting that it was the genetic underpinning for the allometric slopes in wing length that differed between innerfarm islands and outer non-farm islands (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), while it was environmental underpinnings (plasticity patterns) that caused the difference in the allometric slopes between island types in tarsus length (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). However, we cannot confirm these results as the 85% confidence intervals overlapped each other considerably.</p><p>The stability and evolution of the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix (the G matrix)</p><p>has received considerable attention because of its implications for the evolutionary trajectory of traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnold et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Björklund and Gustafsson 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Houle et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McGlothlin et al. 2018)</ref>. Although G matrices are highly conserved among some populations, they have also been demonstrated to diverge in response to both selection and/or experimental treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hine et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Björklund et al. 2012)</ref>. We applied the proposed SEM approach in order to compare the G matrix of morphological traits across populations, but the same can also be done across species.</p><p>This would provide insights into the adaptive changes to the structure of the G matrix resulting from selection on the allometric relationships and structure of developmental modules. Allometric constraints on morphological evolution can be understood as the strength of the correlations between different morphological measures resulting from body size variation (i.e. the allometric slopes). Therefore, body size and the evolution of morphological shape can be investigated by focusing on how selection affects the various allometric slopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bolstad et al. 2015)</ref>. For instance, selection can influence the pleiotropic effect of genes affecting the growth and development of different morphological traits. This may change the allometric relationships and/or the amount of size-independent variation in a trait, causing an adaptive change in the G matrix. Therefore, whilst genetic correlations caused by allometric relationships may constrain morphological evolution in the short term, they can also be modified in response to selection in the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnold et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Voje et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Evolution can also influence how environmental factors affect the expression of different morphological traits. Environmental pleiotropy has received relatively little attention, but the structure of the covariance caused by environmental effects during development can be very important because it determines how organisms respond to variation in the environment in terms of adaptive and passive plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(West-Eberhard 2003)</ref>. Importantly, the structure and evolution of environmental pleiotropy, i.e. the PE matrix, can be studied in the same way as the G matrix (see discussion above). The shared developmental mechanisms underpinning environmental correlations (PE matrix) will constrain the independent changes of single morphological traits. However, organisms can also be selected to change their plastic response in one or more morphological traits by diverting more or less resources to the development of different morphological traits depending on environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Robinson and Beckerman 2013)</ref>. This will in turn alter the structure of the PE matrix in terms of the pattern of morphological correlations caused by environmental pleiotropy. In other words, integrated plasticity in response to environmental variation during development can evolve in response to functional pressures <ref type="bibr">(Pigliucci 2001b)</ref>. While the G matrix estimated here partly reflects how selection may have shaped the morphology of house sparrows in response to their selective landscape, the PE matrix may reflect how house sparrow morphology evolved to respond to more immediate developmental conditions (e.g. nestling food availability).</p><p>Importantly, the relatively consistent results from the SEM, as applied to the genetic and environmental covariation in the present study, indicate that the PE matrix partly aligns with the G matrix. This suggests that plasticity may aid adaptive phenotypic integration, and that both genetic and (permanent) environmental factors in this system tend to affect morphometric characters through similar physiological pathways <ref type="bibr">(Pigliucci 2001a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lind et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study highlights that using SEMs in combination with allometric and quantitative genetic theory provides substantial additional insight concerning our understanding of morphological evolution. We estimated conditional evolvabilities and quantified the degree to which allometric relationships can constrain the evolution of house sparrow morphology in the short term. We found differences in the allometric relationships between inner farm versus outer non-farm island populations with different environmental regimes, suggesting that environmental differences have shaped the genetic or environmental underpinnings of allometric relationships in this system. More generally, the framework developed in this study can be used to make inferences not only of the environmental and genetic covariance matrices (PE and G), but can also be applied to phylogenetic covariance patterns, in order test ecological hypotheses about the evolution of morphological diversity.   <ref type="table">2</ref>).

The model also partitioned withinindividual variation in the morphological traits due to metapopulation-wide among-year (Vy) and among month (Vm) variation in environmental conditions, as well as among-measurement variation (Vr) which can be caused by measurement error or reversible plasticity in response to local environmental conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix S2. Simulation study</head><p>We use simulated data to study the robustness of the SEM approach in recovering a biological model of morphological covariation caused by variation in body size (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We simulated data for 5 morphological traits following a biological model, where individual variation in somatic investment generated variation and co variation between the 5 simulated morphological traits. We studied the covariation of the log-transformed morphological measurements using three different   We worked under the assumption that body size is a volume measure, can be measured in units of grams, and scales isometrically with body mass. Thus, the allometric slope for body mass was one, but it is important to note that body mass also has size-independent variation not associated to body size. Body size in the simulated data had a mean equal to the mean body mass in the studied population and the variance in body size was equal to the variance in body mass explained by body size observed in the empirical study (2.85). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of sample size.</head><p>We first explored the effect of the number of individuals sampled (100, 500, 1000, 5000) in the estimation of the allometric slopes. The results show that PCA and bivariate regression provided consistently biased estimates, while the SEM estimates where unbiased (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This bias was independent of sample size. Effects of size-independent variation in body mass.</p><p>We proceeded to study how the amount of size-independent variation affected the estimation of the allometric slopes. We varied the amount of size-independent variation in body size. We simulated 3 scenarios of varying size-independent variation in body mass. The scenarios corresponded to data sets where the size-independent variation in body mass was: i) half of that estimated in the studied sparrow meta-population, ii) the same size-independent variance, and iii) 1.5 times higher. Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref> shows that the bias in the bivariate regression and PCA is proportional to the amount of sizeindependent variation in the surrogate measure of body size (i.e. body mass). Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>. Mean and 95% confidence intervals of the estimated slopes from the simulated data sets where the size-independent variance and the allometric slopes of all traits were the same as in the observed data. The estimates were obtained using bivariate regressions, bivariate regression with correction factor k, PCA and SEM. Effects of the differences in size-independent variation in the different morphological traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulated</head><p>We also studied how the differences between the different traits in size-independent variation affected the estimation of the allometric slopes. We examined the bias in allometric slopes in a scenario where the size-independent variances are different versus a scenario where the sizeindependent variances are the same. We simulated two different scenarios one had the same allometric slopes and size-independent variance as in the studied house sparrow population, whereas in the other scenario the allometric slopes (b=1) and size-independent variances (Ve=0.5) were the same for all traits. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that when the size-independent variance and allometric slopes are the same in PCA and SEM then both approaches produce unbiased estimates, while bivariate regressions still underestimate the allometric slopes.
