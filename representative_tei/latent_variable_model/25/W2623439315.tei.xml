<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The latent variable "δ" (for "dementia") uniquely explains dementia severity. Depressive symptoms are independent predictors of δ. We explored 115 serum proteins as potential causal mediators of the effect of depressive symptoms on δ in a large, ethnically diverse, longitudinal cohort. All models were adjusted for age, apolipoprotein E, education, ethnicity, gender, hemoglobin A1c, and homocysteine, and replicated in randomly selected 50% subsets. Alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT), FAS, Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor (HB-EGF), Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein type 1 alpha (MIP-1α), Resitin, S100b, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1), and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule type 1 (VCAM-1) each were partial mediators of depression's association with δ. These proteins may offer targets for the treatment of depression's specific effect on dementia severity and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) conversion risk.</p></div>

However, the mechanism(s) involved is not clear. Depressive symptoms may effect clinical dementia independently of neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The subset of clinically diagnosed "AD" cases who lack significant Aβ deposition by positron emission tomography are more likely to be taking antidepressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[5]</ref>. On the other hand, the Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram has been shown to alter amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and /or clearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Dementia cannot be diagnosed on the basis of cognitive impairment alone. Instead, cognitively mediated functional impairments are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[7]</ref>. We have discovered that Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) are related to cognitive performance largely through</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods Subjects</head><p>Subjects included n = 3385 TARCC participants, including 1240 cases of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 688 "Mild Cognitive Impairment "(MCI) cases, and 1384 normal controls (NC). Each underwent serial annual standardized clinical examinations. Categorical clinical diagnoses of "AD", "MCI" and "NC" were established through consensus. The diagnosis of AD was based on National Institute for Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[19]</ref> The diagnosis of MCI was based on site-specific consensus-based clinical diagnoses derived from all available information but without reliance on specific neurocognitive tests and /or cut-scores. "All available information" included the results of TARCC's entire neuropsychological battery, clinical evaluations, informant interviews, and any available outside medical records. We could not easily use cut-scores because MA norms are not available for many measures. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at each site and written informed consent was obtained for all participants.</p><p>δ's indicators δ was constructed from data acquired at Wave 2, i.e., one year after collection of the GDS and serum biomarkers. δ's indicators included Logical Memory II (LMII) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref>, Visual Reproduction I (VRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref>, the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[21]</ref>, Digit Span Test (DST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref> and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[22]</ref>. All tests were available in Spanish translation. The latent variables' indicators were not adjusted for this analysis. The resulting unadjusted δ homolog was validated by its association with dementia severity, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[23]</ref> and by Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis.</p><p>Logical Memory II: <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref> Following a thirty minute delay, the subject recalls two paragraphs read aloud.</p><p>Visual Reproduction I: <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref> The subject immediately reproduces a set of figures after a brief exposure.</p><p>The Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA): <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[21]</ref> The patient is asked to name as many words as they can in one minute, beginning with a certain letter.</p><p>Digit Span Test (DST): <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[20]</ref> The DST sums the longest set of numbers the subject can immediately recall in correct order (forwards and backwards).</p><p>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL): <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[22]</ref> IADL's were assessed using informant ratings. Functional abilities were rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 3 (specific incapacity). A total IADL score calculated as the sum of all eight items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariates</head><p>All observed measures in the structural models were adjusted for age, APOE ε4 burden education, ethnicity, gender, homocysteine (HCY), and hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c).</p><p>Clinical covariates. Age: Self-reported age was reconciled with date of birth and coded continuously.</p><p>Education: Education was coded continuously as years of formal education. Ethnicity: Ethnicity was determined by self-report and coded dichotomously as "Hispanic" and "non-Hispanic".</p><p>Gender: Gender was coded dichotomously. Biological covariates. Measurements of HCY, HgbA1c and APOE ε4 genotyping were performed in the Ballantyne laboratory at the Baylor College of Medicine. HgbA1c was measured in whole blood by the turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA). HCY was measured in serum using the recombinant enzymatic cycling assay (i.e., Roche Hitachi 911). APOE genotyping. APOE genotyping was conducted using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[23]</ref>. APOE ε4 burden was coded 0-2 based on the number of ε4 alleles.</p></div>

The information necessary to those ratings is collected during an interview with the patient and their caregiver. Each CDR domain is rated on a scale of 0.0-3.0. A total CDR-SB score is calculated as the sum of all six domains.</p><p>The Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[26]</ref>: Depressive Symptoms were assessed at baseline (Wave 1). GDS scores range from zero-30. Higher scores are worse. Scores &gt; 10/30 are considered to be clinically significant. The GDS is valid in demented persons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[26]</ref> The Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[27]</ref>: The MMSE is a well known and widely used test for screening cognitive impairment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biomarker mediators</head><p>TARCC's methodology has been described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[28]</ref>. Serum samples were sent frozen to Rules-Based Medicine (RBM) in Austin, TX. There they were assayed without additional freeze-thaw cycles. RBM conducted multiplexed immunoassay via their human multi-analyte profile (human MAP). Serum samples were sent frozen to Rules-Based Medicine (RBM) in Austin, TX. There they were assayed without additional freeze-thaw cycles. RBM conducted multiplexed immunoassay via their human multi-analyte profile (human MAP). A complete listing of the biomarker panel we employed is available at <ref type="url" target="http://www.rulesbasedmedicine.com">http://www.rulesbasedmedicine. com</ref>.</p><p>We ran all RBM analyses in duplicate and discarded data when the duplicate values differed by &gt; 5%. All values recorded by RBM as "LOW" were recorded and analyzed. If more than 50% of the samples for a given analyte were recorded as "LOW", all readings for that analyte were dropped. If less than 50% of the analytes were recorded as "LOW", the LOW values were recorded as the least detectable dose (LDD) divided by two. Raw biomarker data were inspected to ascertain their normality. Data points beyond 3.0 standard deviations (SD) about the mean were labeled as "outliers" and deleted. Logarithmic transformation was used to normalize highly skewed distributions. The data were then standardized to a mean of zero and unit variance. TARCC's RBM biomarkers exhibit significant batch effects. Therefore, each biomarker was additionally adjusted for dichotomous dummy variables coding batch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Analysis sequence. This analysis was performed using Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) software. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[29]</ref> The maximum likelihood estimator was chosen. All observed indicators were adjusted for age, education, ethnicity and gender. Co-variances between the residuals were estimated if they were significant and improved fit.</p><p>We used the ethnicity equivalent δ homolog ("dEQ") as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[30]</ref> That homolog has been reported to 1) exhibit factor equivalence across ethnicity, 2) have excellent fit (i.e., χ 2 /df = 181/24, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.05), 3) have acceptable factor determinacy by Grice's Method <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[31]</ref>, 4) exhibit factor equivalence across ethnicity, 5) to be strongly correlated with dementia severity as measured by the CDR (r = 0.99, p &lt;0.001) and 6) to exhibit an AUC of 0.97 (CI: 0.97-0.98) for the discrimination between AD cases and controls (in Wave 2 TARCC data). For the purposes of this analysis, dEQ was again constructed in Wave 2 data, but without any covariates, specifically age, ethnicity, GDS, gender, HCY, HGbA1c and APOE ε4 burden.</p><p>dEQ and g' factor weights were applied to Wave 2 observed data to generate Wave 2 dEQ and g' composite scores (i.e., dEQ w2 and g' w2, respectively). g' is dEQ's residual in Spearman's g. The composite scores were used as observed outcomes in models of a baseline APOE ε4 allele's direct association with covariate adjusted Wave 2 dEQ.</p><p>Next, we constructed a longitudinal mediation model in SEM (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Such models can arguably be interpreted causally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[32]</ref> Path "a" represents the GDS' direct association with Wave 2 dEQ scores. We modeled GDS as a continuous measure of depressive symptoms, not "depression" as a categorical diagnosis. Categorical diagnoses reduce information (relative to continuous measures) and introduce measurement bias (inherent to the application of diagnostic criteria). Morever, TARCC's selection bias (as an "AD" study), selects against more impaired depressive cases.</p><p>Path "b" represents the biomarker's independent effect on dEQ, measured at Wave 1. When both were significant, we considered path "c". Bonferroni correction to p &lt;0.001 was used to offset the potential for Type 2 error after multiple comparisons. The biomarker's mediation effect on the APOE ε4 allele's direct association can then be calculated by MaKinnon's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[33]</ref>.</p><p>The mediation models were constructed in a randomly selected subset of TARCC participants, comprising approximately 50% of the subjects (i.e., Group 1: n = 1691). As a test of each model's generalizability to the remainder (n = 1694), each mediation path's significant direct association was constrained across the two groups, and model fit compared across constrained and unconstrained conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[35]</ref> Mediation effects were calculated among Group 1 participants in the constrained models.</p><p>Missing data. We used the newest instance of TARCC's dataset (circa 2016). The entire dataset was employed. Clinical diagnoses were available on 3385 subjects, 2861 of whom had complete data for δ's cognitive indicators and covariates. Modern Missing Data Methods were automatically applied by the AMOS software. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[36]</ref> AMOS employs Full information Maximum Likelihood (FIML). <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[38]</ref> Only the ROC analyses, performed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[39]</ref>, were limited to complete cases. Fit indices. Fit was assessed using four common test statistics: chi-square, the ratio of the chisquare to the degrees of freedom in the model (CMIN /DF), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). A non-significant chisquare signifies that the data are consistent with the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[40]</ref>. However, in large samples, this metric conflicts with other fit indices (insensitive to sample size) show that the model fits the data very well. A CMIN/DF ratio &lt; 5.0 suggests an adequate fit to the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[41]</ref> The CFI statistic compares the specified model with a null model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[42]</ref> CFI values range from 0 to 1.0. Values below 0.95 suggest model misspecification. Values approaching 1.0 indicate adequate to excellent fit. An RMSEA of 0.05 or less indicates a close fit to the data, with models below 0.05 considered "good" fit, and up to 0.08 as "acceptable". <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[43]</ref> All fit statistics should be simultaneously considered when assessing the adequacy of the models to the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The demographic characteristics of TARCC's sample are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The mean GDS score was 5.60 ± 5.25, i.e., within the normal range. N = 537 (17.9%) scored !10 /30 (i.e., in the "depressed" range). The unadjusted wave 2 dEQ achieved a high AUC for the discrimination between AD cases and NC (AUC = 0.953; CI: 0.946-0.960). g"s AUC for the same discrimination was at a near chance level [AUC = 0.536 (CI: 0.514-0.558)]. This is consistent with past findings, across batteries, in this and other cohorts.</p><p>The Base Model fit well [χ 2 = 84.42 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(11)</ref>, p &lt;0.001; CFI = 0.978; RMSEA = 0.044]. Independently of the covariates (i.e., age, APOE ε4 burden, education, ethnicity, gender, HCY, and Hgb A1c), baseline GDS score was significantly directly associated with Wave 2 dEQ (r = -0.11, p&lt;0.001), and weakly with the Wave 2 g' composite (r = -0.03, p = 0.03). g' was then dropped from consideration. The baseline GDS score's significant association with Wave 2 dEQ scores was in a negative direction suggesting an adverse effect on future observed cognitive performance.</p><p>The mediation models all had acceptable fit [e.g., resistin: χ 2 = 455.02 <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.914; RMSEA = 0.049 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1)</ref>]. alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT), FAS, Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-I), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein type 1 alpha (MIP-1a), Resitin, S100b, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1), and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule type 1 (VCAM-1) achieved statistically significant mediation effects after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). A1AT and resistin have previously been recognized depression-specific serum protein biomarkers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[43]</ref> All the identified proteins were partial mediators. Resistin's effect was the largest (z = -4.54, p &lt;0.01; 33.2%). We did not test multivariate mediations or interactions.</p><p>Beta2-microglobulin (b2M), Chromogranin A, and Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor type II (TNF-RII) were associated with the GDS, but unrelated to dEQ by path b. b2M and TNF-RII have been previously recognized as depression-specific serum protein biomarkers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[45]</ref> However, although they might be related to cognitive performance (independently of δ), they cannot explain depression's dementing aspects.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the GDS-independent dEQ biomarkers. These include all but one (i.e., b2M) of those that we have previously associated with δ in GDS adjusted models. Also in this list are additional proteins [i.e., Apolipoprotein CIII (APOCIII), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), cortisol, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), and Prolactin (PRL)] that have been previously associated with depression in other samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[48]</ref> TARCC's remaining protein biomarkers were related neither to the GDS, nor to dEQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have surveyed more than 100 potential mediators of the GDS's specific and significant association with δ. Our sample size was large, and we were powered to detect even statistically weak effects. All our findings have been replicated in random subsets of TARCC's data. We have replicated all but one of our previously observed GDS-adjusted biomarker associations with δ, even though 1) our sample size has increased over time, 2) we are using a new δ homolog, 3) the biomarkers are being used to predict future cognitive performance, and 4) the prior associations were obtained using raw biomarker data while these employ normalized variables.</p><p>We have also independently confirmed 4/9 serum proteins previously recognized as depression-specific serum protein biomarkers by Papakostas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[44]</ref> and Bilello et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[45]</ref>. We have additionally clarified that of those four, only A1AT and resistin are mediators of depressive symptoms' dementing effect on disabling (i.e., "dementing") cognitive performance.</p><p>We could not confirm Papakostas et al.'s association between five serum proteins and depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[44]</ref> These included APOCIII, BDNF, Cortisol, EGF, and PRL. Each were associated with δ, but not the GDS. Additionally, BDNF and cortisol were associated with δ, but not the GDS.

Moreover, we could find no studies associating serum BDNF or cortisol specifically with the GDS in older persons. On the contrary, two studies failed to associate serum cortisol <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[47]</ref> or BDNF <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[48]</ref> with the GDS 15 and 30 respectively. Moreover, our results do confirm BDNF's <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[52]</ref> and cortisol's <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[53]</ref> reported associations with dementia severity, and we can also confirm both testosterone's lack of an association with the GDS30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[54]</ref> and its significant association with dementia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[55]</ref> We have identified four classes of proteins: 1) potential mediators of the GDS's significant direct effect on δ, 2) δ-independent predictors of GDS, 3) GDS-independent predictors of δ, and 4) proteins unrelated to either the GDS or δ. While many proteins were related to the GDS, only a subset were associated with δ. δ in turn, has been associated with atrophy in the Default Mode Network (DMN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[56]</ref>, as has dDEP" (i.e., a δ ortholog targeting the GDS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[57]</ref> This suggests that the mediators in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> may be associated with the structure and /or function of the DMN. Thompson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[58]</ref> found that elevated serum protein S100B levels to be significantly correlated with DMN activity in older persons. S100B has been recognized as a potential treatment target in mood disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[46]</ref> and is confirmed as a mediator of depressive symptoms' disabling cognitive effects by this analysis. It is also interesting that all of the mediators in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> have been previously associated with δ in GDS adjusted models <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. This hints at depression independent effects of the same proteins on dementia-severity. For instance, IGF-1, FAS, resistin and S100B also mediate age's effect on δ <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Our observations help clarify depression's effects on cognitive function. First, although depressive symptoms may have both direct and indirect effects on observed cognitive performance, only indirect effects mediated by δ should be functionally salient, and thus "dementing." This constrains the "pseudodementia" of depression to an effect on intelligence. This may limit the ability of antidepressant interventions to reverse depression's more disabling (i.e., "dementing") cognitive sequelae. Successful interventions on the "dementia of depression" (DoD) will have to effect changes in general intelligence, regardless of their effect on selfreported mood. This may explain the relatively slow trajectory of functional recovery after otherwise "successful" antidepressant treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[60]</ref> Unfortunately, we do not have access to antidepressant treatment data, and so we cannot test for associations between antidepressant exposure and δ.</p><p>One limitation to our study is that we tested univariate associations. We cannot address whether subsets of these proteins may be acting in concert to effect changes in dementia severity, nor do our results indicate the biological networks or systems through which they act. Such issues are beyond the scope of this data. However, it is unlikely that they contribute to a single dementing process. The wide range of serum proteins in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> suggest that they impinge upon the d-score through multiple processes. A further limitation is that these proteins were not rationally selected and TARCC's panel, although extensive, is not exhaustive. However, our results have been Bonferroni corrected to reduce Type II error.</p><p>Nevertheless, the mediators identified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> may offer targets for the specific remediation of depression's dementing cognitive effects. Several of these proteins may be embedded in networks that are amenable to pharmacological modulation. Alternatively, any individual protein might be modulated by a wide range of biological techniques.</p><p>Finally, although the GDS was weakly associated with prospective dEQ scores, even small changes in that construct are likely to be clinically meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[15]</ref>. The GDS is associated with a two-fold increased 5yr dementia conversion risk in TARCC. We have shown resistin, strongest of the Class 1 biomarkers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), to fully mediate that effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[61]</ref>. Resistin is reported to be elevated in AD cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[62]</ref>. Successful antidepressant treatment has been reported to reduce resistin levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[63]</ref>. This suggests some potential to modify δ scores in the context of antidepressant treatment. Because δ is agnostic to dementia etiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">64]</ref>, antidepressant intervention might improve a wide range of conditions, even in the presence of subsyndromal depressive symptoms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Texas</head><label></label><figDesc>Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), which has filed provisional patents 61/ 603,226: "A Latent Variable Approach to the Identification and/or Diagnosis of Cognitive Disorders", 61/671,858: "A Serum Biomarker Screen for the Diagnosis of Clinical and Pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease in Non-Hispanic Populations", and 62/112,703: "Methods and Approach for Detection and Prediction of Change in Dementia Severity or Clinical Diagnosis over Time" relating to the latent variable δ's construction and biomarkers.There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
