<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Flex-route transit (FRT) has significant advantages in low-demand areas. Existing studies have focused on practical experience, strategic planning, and operational planning. Few studies have addressed the effect of sociodemographic and psychological latent characteristics on the acceptance of FRT. This study aims at exploring the effect of sociodemographic and psychological latent characteristics on FRT acceptance. To finish the goal, a household survey is conducted from April to May 2020 in Nanjing, China. The survey includes sociodemographic characteristics and observed variables of individuals. Firstly, the study extracts six psychological latent characteristics to reflect individuals' attitudes based on previous and mature researches in the field of technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB). Then, a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) is applied to calculate six psychological latent characteristics. Finally, an integrated model, consisting of the MIMIC and a binary logit model (BLM), is applied to match sociodemographic and psychological latent characteristics. The BLM with sociodemographic characteristics is developed as the reference model to compare the effects of psychological latent characteristics. Results show that psychological latent factors play a significant role in estimating the effect on FRT acceptance. Results of the integrated model show that the parameter of car is -0.325, displaying individuals with private cars are more reluctant to use FRT. Therefore, restricting private cars is an effective measure to facilitate FRT. Improving flexibility (0.241) is a significant measure to facilitate FRT. Findings are expected to facilitate decision-making of transport planners and engineers, and therefore enhance the service of the FRT system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Public transit is an effective option for releasing traffic congestion and reducing vehicle emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The traditional fixed-route transit has been successfully operated in many cities. The advantages of such a mode might be subjected to the low-demand areas. For instance, the fixed schedule and routes could increase the departure interval of buses in low-demand areas, and in turn affect the comfort of passengers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. In this context, flex-route transit (FRT) is regarded as a promising public transit mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. The operation data of the FRT in Merrill indicate that FRT has a positive impact on the transport system, especially in low-demand areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The ridership in Virginia is found significantly increase (about 354%) after operating the FRT system, and about 82 percent of passengers are satisfied with the service of FRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>FRT can offer services with a base route, which has several compulsory stations (i.e., checkpoints). The bus has to stop at the compulsory station on time. Thus, FRT not only can punctually offer services at the checkpoints, but also can serve the passengers at not-checkpoints (i.e., request) using the slack time <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Compared with traditional fixed-route transit, FRT is more flexible because it allows the bus to deviate from the base route and provide door-todoor services <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Also, such a mode is more economical when offering door-to-door services due to the high capacity compared with dial-a-ride systems or taxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies mainly focused on three aspects: practical experience, strategic planning, and operational planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For practical experience, FRT was applied primitively during the 1970s. Then it was implemented in Merrill, Wisconsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The FRT can offer a feasible traffic mode in lower-density travel areas and serve passengers more effectively. Besides, FRT was applied successfully in OmniLink, Prince William County, Virginia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The ridership of public transit in these areas has been increasing steadily since the introduction of the FRT. Moreover, the efficiency of the FRT improved significantly with the help of ITS technologies. For example, vehicle location can be tracked in real-time and information can be shared by interaction platforms between drivers and dispatchers by ITS technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For strategy planning, which aims to apply an appropriate transit system in the different service areas and actual demand levels. Therefore, a decision method between traditional fixed-route and FRT in various demand densities was presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Furthermore, a mixed transit system incorporating the advantages of fixed-route transit and FRT was proposed. Results indicated that such a mixed system is superior to other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Several studies have been conducted on the scheduling planning of FRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. For instance, a real-time operation route of the bus was designed based on the route design and service levels of FRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The time schedules should be consistent with predetermined timetables before every departure. Several linear integer formulations, including three various planning policies, are proposed to solve the scheduling planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In addition, an insertion algorithm is presented to address the static and dynamic scheduling of the operation of FRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that the operation and planning of a new travel mode are significantly related to the individuals' acceptance of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Indeed, several researchers believe that acceptance of a new travel mode is related to sociodemographic characteristics, such as gender, age, income, and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. In addition, travel behavior is also relevant to psychological factors, such as comfort, use willingness, and perceived barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. FRT acceptance is related to influencing factors due to the features of public transit. However, few studies identify the effect of influencing factors on FRT acceptance. Therefore, it is worth exploring the effect of sociodemographic characteristics and psychological latent factors for developing FRT.</p><p>To finish this goal, the study conducted a household survey to collect sociodemographic characteristics and observed variables. Based on previous and mature researches in the field of technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), the study extracts six psychological latent factors (i.e., comfort, flexibility, perceived barriers, personal barriers, subjective evaluation, and use willingness). Such latent factors can be calculated by a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC). The integrated model, including the MIMIC and a binary logit model (BLM), is used to address the effect of sociodemographic and six psychological latent characteristics. The contribution of the study is to identify the effects of socioeconomic and psychological latent factors on FRT acceptance by applying an integrated model, and further make some policy recommendations to facilitate FRT.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The survey data are described in Section 2. Section 3 focuses on the research methodology. The results and discussions are conducted in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the contributions and directions for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Survey data</head><p>The household survey was conducted in the fringe of the city of Nanjing (China) to collect sociodemographic and observed variables of respondents in low-demand areas on FRT. Nanjing is located in southeast China, with a population of 9.31 million and an area of 6540.53 km 2 in 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The data originated from the survey from April to May 2020 by the School of Transportation, Southeast University.</p><p>1290 questionnaires were randomly distributed to respondents. To improve the quality of the survey, the questionnaire did not include respondents' private information (e.g., name and ID card). The survey explained that the aim of the survey was to develop FRT. Respondents answers were helpful in conducting the study. Respondents filled in the questionnaire after they understood the survey. The final survey referred to two main points: (1) Sociodemographic characteristics of respondents; (2) Observed variables of respondents. The study selected six psychological latent factors (i.e., comfort, flexibility, perceived barriers, personal barriers, subjective evaluation, and use willingness) based on previous and mature researches in the field of TAM and TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. 18 observed variables were defined to reflect psychological latent factors on FRT by the Cattell's Scree Plot method <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>972 valid samples were obtained after excluding invalid data (the effective rate was 75.35%). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> describes sociodemographic characteristics and familiarity with FRT of respondents.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the description of 18 observed variables with the Likert seven-scale method <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>To testify the reliability and validity of the survey data, and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sample measurements and Bartlett ball tests are used. KMO values are all higher than 0.5, the Bartlett ball test is less than 0.05, and Cronbach's Alpha is higher than 0.7, which indicate the reliability and validity of the data are ideal <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the minimum KMO and Cronbach's Alpha are use willingness (0.550) and perceived barriers (0.712), respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>To examine the effect of sociodemographic and psychological latent characteristics on FRT acceptance, an integrated model is applied.

This could be attributed to the difference in the perception on FRT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Integrated model</head><p>The integrated model is applied to examine the effect of explanatory variables on FRT acceptance. BLM, as a reference, is used to compare the effect of psychological latent factors. SPSS is utilized to celebrate the parameters of the two models. The McFadden pseudo R 2 is applied to estimate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Akaike information criterion (AIC) is utilized to compare the good-of-fit of the two models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. For McFadden R 2 , the result is acceptable when the McFadden R 2 of the model is more than 0.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Variables that have statistically significant effects are saved by the stepwise model building process. The results of the BLM and integrated model are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, the McFadden pseudo R 2 of the BLM and integrated model are 0.261 and 0.368, respectively. Both values are more than 0.2. Meanwhile, the AIC of the integrated model (0.94) is lower than that of BLM <ref type="bibr">(1.11)</ref>. Thus, the goodness-of-fit of the integrated model is better compared to BLM. Results indicate that psychological latent factors play a significant role in estimating the effects.</p><p>(1) The effect of sociodemographic characteristics The acceptance of individuals on FRT is related to age, income, education, car availability and familiarity with FRT. Income (-0.045) and car availability (-0.325) are negative to FRT acceptance. The results indicate that the probability of FRT acceptance would be lower for individuals with higher income or private cars. The probability of FRT acceptance may be higher for lower-income individuals, which is reasonable due to the lack of the ability to purchase a car. The results are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Individuals with private cars tend to use a private car due to the advantages of the short travel time compared to FRT. The findings are aligned with <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The FRT acceptance is positively related to age (0.026), education (0.034) and familiarity with FRT (0.098), and familiarity with FRT has the most positive impact.</p><p>Respondents who have a higher familiarity with FRT, have a higher possibility of accepting FRT. The results may be logical that they have more understanding of the advantages of FRT.</p><p>The results are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Elderly individuals are inclined to accept FRT. This might be that short walking time, resulting from the advantage of door-to-door service, is crucial for them. The probability of accepting FRT would increase for individuals with higher education. The reason could be that FRT acceptance be higher for them. The findings are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. However, no obvious evidence shows that gender and age have a significant effect on FRT acceptance in the integrated model. The reason could be that their effects are included in psychological latent factors, which are relevant to sociodemographic characteristics. The results for sociodemographic characteristics indicate that restricting private car ownership may be the most effective measure to improve the market share of FRT for sociodemographic characteristics.</p><p>(2) The effect of psychological latent factors Six psychological latent factors are significantly related to FRT acceptance based on the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. Perceived barriers (-0.142) have a negative influence on FRT acceptance, implying that the probability of accepting FRT may increase when perceived barriers decrease. For instance, perceived barriers may be decreased since the scheduling of FRT is strictly implemented to serve individuals punctually. The results are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In addition, these psychological latent factors (i.e., comfort, flexibility, subjective evaluation, personal barriers, and use willingness) have a positive effect on FRT, and flexibility (0.241) is the most positive variable. Individuals have a stronger tendency to accept FRT when a higher comfort is available. The reason could be that comfort is regarded as a crucial variable for individuals. Enhancing the comfort of FRT is an effective measure to facilitate FRT acceptance, such as large-capacity buses are operated to enhance comfort by providing at least a seat for each. The findings are aligned with <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The positive relationship between flexibility and FRT acceptance indicates that increased flexibility of FRT could help motivate individuals' demand. The flexibility of FRT can be enhanced by shortening the waiting time for individuals. The results are coinciding with <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Individuals with higher personal barriers are more willing to accept FRT due to the advantage of short walking distance. For example, individuals with disabilities have a stronger tendency to accept FRT, since they can take FRT at any location rather than walk to the bus station. The findings are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Subjective evaluation is positively related to FRT adoption. Thus, subjective evaluation should be considered an influential variable for developing FRT. In other words, individuals with higher subjective evaluation are more likely to accept FRT. For instance, FRT not only reduces private car ownership and alleviates traffic congestion due to the large-capacity attribute of public transit. The findings are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Furthermore, use willingness has a positive effect on FRT acceptance. It could be attributed to the effects of their friends and relatives. The results are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This study aims at exploring the effect of sociodemographic and psychological latent factors on the acceptance of FRT. For sociodemographic characteristics, results indicate that restricting private car ownership (-0.325) is the most effective measure to improve FRT acceptance. Policies (such as increasing vehicle purchase tax and congestion charging fee) can be implemented to reduce private car ownership to improve the FRT acceptance. Results also show that individuals who are familiar with FRT are more willing to finish their trips by using FRT. Also, age and education are found to be positively correlated to FRT acceptance. In contrast, high-income shows a negative influence on FRT acceptance. No evidence indicates that gender and age are related to FRT acceptance. For psychological factors, comfort, flexibility, subjective evaluation, personal barriers, and use willingness are significantly correlated to FRT acceptance. In particular, flexibility (0.241) is more sensitive. Therefore, measures can be made to enhance flexibility (such as reducing the waiting time of individuals by increasing the buses or shortening the departure intervals.), so that the FRT acceptance might be improved. Perceived barriers has a negative impact, which can be indicative of the policies and strategies that can improve the service of the FRT system. Also, measures that can enhance the promotion of FRT to the public are crucial.</p><p>The study sheds light on the effect of sociodemographic and psychological latent characteristics on the FRT acceptance by applying an integrated model. The study shows the necessity of identifying determinants that affect the acceptance of individuals on FRT. Some future research efforts are still needed. First, sociodemographic and psychological latent characteristics are selected based on other behavior research of the public (such as bicycle and carsharing systems), TAM and TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Factors such as the efficiency of FRT can be considered in future studies. Also, the general public usually takes time to recognize and adapt to new infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.

The BLM describes the mode choice. The implementation of the integrated model can be divided into two steps: the first step is to estimate psychological latent factors (dashed box), and the second step is fulfilled to evaluate the discrete choice by the BLM (solid box).The MIMIC model used in this study includes three types of variables: sociodemographic characteristics, observed variables, and psychological latent variables. Rectangular boxes in Fig 1(A) represent sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, income, education, child, car availability, and familiarity). These factors are used to analyze the relationships with latent variables. It is a measurement equation. Ellipses boxes in Fig 1(B) represent psychological latent factors (i.e., comfort, flexibility, perceived barriers, personal barriers, subjective evaluation, and use willingness). It is the structural equation that is applied to analyze the relationship between latent variables. Rectangular boxes in Fig 1(C) are observed variables that can be obtained from the survey data. They are used to extract latent variables. The process is also a measurement equation. Circular boxes represent the error term. The single-headed arrows represent the causal effects between variables, and all the path coefficients are estimated. The relationship of factors provides crucial information in understanding FRT acceptance. The schematic structure of the MIMIC model is shown in Fig 1.</figDesc></figure>

In addition, The AIC of the integrated model is 0.94, which lower than the AIC of the BLM (1.11). The results confirm the superiority of developing model considering psychological latent factors.</figDesc></figure>
