<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Medical dialogue generation aims to provide automatic and accurate responses to assist physicians to obtain diagnosis and treatment suggestions in an efficient manner. In medical dialogues two key characteristics are relevant for response generation: patient states (such as symptoms, medication) and physician actions (such as diagnosis, treatments). In medical scenarios large-scale human annotations are usually not available, due to the high costs and privacy requirements. Hence, current approaches to medical dialogue generation typically do not explicitly account for patient states and physician actions, and focus on implicit representation instead.</p><p>We propose an end-to-end variational reasoning approach to medical dialogue generation. To be able to deal with a limited amount of labeled data, we introduce both patient state and physician action as latent variables with categorical priors for explicit patient state tracking and physician policy learning, respectively. We propose a variational Bayesian generative approach to approximate posterior distributions over patient states and physician actions. We use an efficient stochastic gradient variational Bayes estimator to optimize the derived evidence lower bound, where a 2stage collapsed inference method is proposed to reduce the bias during model training. A physician policy network composed of an action-classifier and two reasoning detectors is proposed for augmented reasoning ability. We conduct experiments on three datasets collected from medical platforms. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of objective and subjective evaluation metrics. Our experiments also indicate that our proposed semi-supervised reasoning method achieves a comparable performance as state-of-the-art fully supervised learning baselines for physician policy learning.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Increasingly, conversational paradigms are being used to connect people to information, both to address open domain information needs [e.g., <ref type="bibr">14, 17, 23-25, 43, 50]</ref> and in support of professionals in highly specialized vertical domains [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62]</ref>. Our focus is on conversational information seeking approaches in the medical domain. During clinical treatment, a conversational medical system can serve as a physician's assistant to help generate responses for a patient's need, i.e, inquire about symptoms, make a diagnosis, and prescribe medicine or treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59]</ref>. Intelligent medical dialogue systems (MDSs) are able to reduce the work pressure of physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>. Previous work on MDSs mostly focuses on producing an accurate diagnosis given the dialogue context <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59]</ref>. There is very little work that considers the task of multi-turn medical dialogue generation to provide proper medical responses by tapping into large-scale medical knowledge sources.</p><p>There are two key characteristics that are specific to clinical decision support (CDS), and hence for dialogue systems that are meant to support clinical decision making: patient states (e.g., symptoms, medicine, etc.) and physician actions (e.g., treatments, diagnosis, etc.). These two characteristics make MDSs more complicated than other knowledge-intensive dialogue scenarios. Similar to taskoriented dialogue systems (TDSs), a medical dialogue generation (MDG) process can be decomposed into 3 stages: (1) patient state tracking (PST): after encoding the patient's descriptions, the MDS tracks the patient's physiological condition, i.e., patient states, in the discourse context; (2) physician policy learning (PPL): given the patient's states and utterances, the MDS generates the physician's action to embed into the response; and (3) medical response generation (MRG): the MDS responds with a coherent sentence based on detected states and actions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example medical dialogue from the infection department. The left part lists the conversation, whereas the right part indicates patient states and physician actions during the conversation. At the first turn the patient shares their symptoms, i.e., fever, loss of appetite, and cough, as the patient state; the physician asks if the patient has other symptoms, i.e., fatigue, night sweats, and dry cough, to reflect the physician action at the second turn. Both states and actions vary as the conversation develops. At the last turn, the physician's action is to prescribe drugs: Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol.</p><p>The development of end-to-end MDG solutions faces a number of challenges: (1) Most TDSs need a large amount of manually labeled data to predict explicit dialogue states. In medical dialogues, annotators need medical expertise to annotate data. For privacy reasons, large-scale manually labeling intermediate states is problematic. Hence, few TDS methods can directly be applied to MRG <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>.</p><p>(2) Existing approaches to MDG have a limited semantic understanding of the domain, which makes it hard to generate knowledgeable responses in a medical context <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(3)</ref> To help patients or physicians understand why a MDG system generates a response, explainability with indicative and interpretable information is indispensable, which is ignored by most TDS studies.</p><p>To address these challenges, we propose VRBot, which performs variational reasoning for MRG. Inspired by approaches to TDS, VR-Bot contains a patient state tracker and a physician policy network to detect patient states and physician actions, respectively. Unlike previous work, which learns from massive amounts of human-labeled observed variables, VRBot considers the patient state and the physician action as dual latent variables inferred in a variational Bayesian manner. We employ a stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator to efficiently approximate the posterior inference. To alleviate the bias problem during SGVB estimation, we propose a 2stage collapsed inference method to iteratively approximate the posterior distribution over states and actions.</p><p>To address the problem of limited semantic understanding during response generation, we proceed as follows. The physician policy network comprises an action-classifier that classifies physician actions into action categories, and two reasoning components, a context reasoning detector and a graph reasoning detector, that infer explicit action keywords through the dialogue context and medical knowledge graph, respectively. With explicit sequences of patient states, physician actions, and multi-hop reasoning, VRBot is able to provide a high degree of explainability of its medical dialogue generation results.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of VRBot, we collect a knowledgeaware medical dialogue dataset, KaMed. KaMed contains over 60,000 medical dialogue sessions with 5,682 entities (such as Asthma and Atropine). Using KaMed and two other MDG benchmark datasets, we find that VRBot, using limited amounts of labeled data, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for MDG. Hence, given largescale unlabeled medical corpora, VRBot can accurately trace the patient's physiological conditions and provide more informative and engaging responses by predicting appropriate treatments and diagnosis. We also find that VRBot is able to provide more explainable response generation process over other MDG baselines.</p><p>Our contributions are as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(1)</ref> We propose an end-to-end medical response generation model, named VRBot. To the best of our knowledge, VRBot is the first to simultaneously model states and actions as latent variables in TDSs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(2)</ref> We devise a hybrid policy network that contains a context-reasoning detector and a graph-reasoning detector, which allow VRBot to predict physician actions based on the dialogue session and external knowledge simultaneously. (3) We show that VRBot can explicitly track patient states and physician actions even with few or no human-annotated labels. (4) We release KaMed, a large-scale medical dialogue dataset with external knowledge. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) Experiments on benchmark datasets show that VRBot is able to generate more informative, accurate, and explainable responses than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Medical dialogue systems. Previous methods for MDSs are modeled after TDSs, following the paradigm that a patient expresses their symptoms. Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref> propose to learn a dialogue policy for automated diagnosis based on reinforcement learning. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> build a symptom graph to model associations between symptoms to boost the performance of symptom diagnosis. Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref> consider the co-occurrence probability of symptoms with diseases explicitly with reinforcement learning. Xia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref> improve upon this work using mutual information rewards and generative adversarial networks. Meanwhile, various approaches have been explored to improve the understanding of medical dialogue histories, including symptom extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>, medical slot-filling <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>, and medical information extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> investigate the performance of pre-trained models for predicting response entities. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> collect a dataset that consists of millions of dialogue sessions but do not explicitly consider learning the dialogue management as there are no human-annotated labels.</p><p>Currently, no prior work is able to explicitly learn a dialogue policy from a large-scale unlabeled corpus, greatly limiting the application of medical dialogue systems.</p><p>Dialogue state tracking. Dialogue state tracking plays an important role for TDSs. Conditional random field-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22]</ref> and deep neural network-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41]</ref> have been proposed to track states in modular TDSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>. Recently, end-to-end TDSs have attracted a lot of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65]</ref>. For non-task-oriented dialogue generation, Serban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> and Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref> propose generation methods with implicit state representations, for which it is hard to distinguish medical concepts. Dialogue states have also been represented as a sequence of keywords from the dialogue context <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> and Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref> propose semi-supervised generative models to leverage unlabeled data to improve state tracking performance. Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> propose an encoder-decoder training framework, MOSS, to incorporate supervision from various intermediate dialogue system modules. MOSS exploits incomplete supervision during model training. However, existing approaches fail to generate engaging and informative responses as do not address the semantic reasoning ability of the dialogue agents. As far as we know, no existing method simultaneously models states and actions under a few-shot regime.</p><p>In the MDG scenario, learning physician actions is as important as state tracking. Compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65]</ref>, our model is capable of inferring missing states and actions simultaneously.</p><p>Knowledge-grounded conversations. The task of knowledge grounded conversation (KGC) is to generate responses based on accurate background knowledge. The task can be grounded into two categories according to the format of the background knowledge, i.e., structured KGC and unstructured KGC. The former focuses on exploiting knowledge triplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68]</ref> or knowledge graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67]</ref>, the latter conditions on paragraph text <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40]</ref>. For structured KGC, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref> utilize a neural knowledge diffusion module to encode knowledge triplets to predict related entities. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> augment a knowledge graph to integrate with dialogue contexts in an open-domain dialogue. Tuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> assess a model's ability to reason multiple hops using a Markov chain over a constructed transition matrix, so that the model can zero-shot adapt to updated, unseen knowledge graphs. Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref> represent prior dialogue transition information as a knowledge graph and learn a graph grounded dialogue policy for generating coherent and controllable responses. Lei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> construct a useritem-attribute knowledge graph and ingeniously formalize dialogue policy learning as path reasoning on the graph.</p><p>Unlike most structured KGC methods that select knowledge from open-domain knowledge-bases, MDG aims to explore a multihop knowledge path transferred from patient states to physician actions using dedicated medical-domain knowledge graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD 3.1 Problem formulation</head><p>Medical dialogue systems. Given 𝑇 dialogue turns, a medical dialogue session 𝑑 consists of a sequence of utterances, i.e., 𝑑 = {𝑈 1 , 𝑅 1 , 𝑈 2 , 𝑅 2 , . . . , 𝑈 𝑇 , 𝑅 𝑇 }, where 𝑈 𝑡 and 𝑅 𝑡 refers to utterances from a patient and responses from a virtual physician, respectively. At the 𝑡-th turn, given the 𝑡-th patient utterance 𝑈 𝑡 and previous physician response 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , the dialogue system generates a response 𝑅 𝑡 . Let |𝑈 𝑡 | be the number of words in 𝑈 𝑡 , we define 𝑈 𝑡 = (𝑈 𝑡,1 , 𝑈 𝑡,2 , . . . , 𝑈 𝑡, |𝑈 𝑡 | ) as a sequence of words. The full vocabulary is defined as V. 𝐾 denotes an external knowledge base in the medical dialogue system, where each triplet in 𝐾 indicates a head entity, a relation, and a tail entity. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>, we construct a knowledge graph 𝐺 global by linking all triplets with overlapping entities (i.e., two triples will be linked iff they share overlapping entities) in 𝐾. We assume that each entity is categorized into a set of entity types, i.e., 𝐸 𝑡 𝑦𝑝𝑒 = {disease, symptoms, medicines, treatments}.</p><p>We consider VRBot as a model with parameters 𝜃 . Given the dialogue context, responses, and the knowledge graph 𝐺 global , we aim to maximize the probability distribution over 𝑑 in VRBot:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑇 𝑡 =1 𝑝 𝜃 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝐺 global ).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Patient states and physician actions. Text-span based dialogue state trackers have the double advantage of simplicity and good interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55]</ref>. Hence, at the 𝑡-th turn, we define a text span 𝑆 𝑡 (i.e., a sequence of words) as the patient state to summarize past utterances and responses (i.e., 𝑈 1 , 𝑅 1 , . . . , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 ). Then we take 𝑆 𝑡 as constraints to search in a knowledge base. Similar to 𝑆 𝑡 , we also use a text span 𝐴 𝑡 to represent the physician action at the 𝑡th turn, which summarizes the physician's policy such as diagnose, medicine, or treatment. 𝐴 𝑡 is predicted through a policy learning process given 𝑆 𝑡 . Thus, task completion in MDG becomes a problem of generating two successive text spans, 𝑆 𝑡 and 𝐴 𝑡 , at each turn.</p><p>As text spans also help to improve the performance of response generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24]</ref>, generating 𝑆 𝑡 and 𝐴 𝑡 at each turn is a key component in MDG. In this paper, the problem of MDG is decomposed into three successive steps: (1) generating a state span 𝑆 𝑡 ; (2) generating an action span 𝐴 𝑡 ; and (3) generating the response 𝑅 𝑡 .</p><p>Variational Bayesian generative model. Large volumes of intermediate annotations for patient states and physician actions are impractical in MDG. Thus, in VRBot we regard 𝑆 𝑡 and 𝐴 𝑡 as latent variables within a Bayesian generative model, so we reformulate Eq. 1 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑇 𝑡 =1 ∑︁ 𝑆𝑡 ,𝐴𝑡 𝑝 𝜃𝑔 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 ) • 𝑝 𝜃𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) • 𝑝 𝜃𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝑝 𝜃 𝑔 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 ) is derived using a response generator, and 𝑝 𝜃 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) and 𝑝 𝜃 𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) are estimated through a patient state tracker and a physician policy network, respectively. The graphical representation of VRBot is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, where shaded and unshaded nodes indicate observed and latent variables, respectively. We see that a dependency exists between two adjacent states. At 𝑡, 𝑆 𝑡 is derived depending on previous state 𝑆 𝑡 -1 , response 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , and utterance 𝑈 𝑡 ; subsequently, 𝐴 𝑡 is inferred using 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , and 𝐺 global . Thus, we calculate 𝑝 𝜃 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) and 𝑝 𝜃 𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) as: where 𝜃 𝑠 and 𝜃 𝑎 are parameters; and a fixed initial value is assigned to 𝑆 0 at the beginning. In VRBot we propose two prior networks to estimate probabilistic distributions in Eq. 3, i.e., a prior state tracker and prior policy network. Eventually, we draw a response 𝑅 𝑡 from</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑝 𝜃𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) ≜ 𝑝 𝜃𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 |𝑆 𝑡 -1 , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 ) (prior state tracker), 𝑝 𝜃𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) ≜ 𝑝 𝜃𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 |𝑆 𝑡 , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝐺 𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 ) (prior policy network),<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑝 𝜃 𝑔 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 ), with parameters 𝜃 𝑔 .</formula><p>To maximize Eq. 2, we estimate the posterior distribution 𝑝 𝜃 (𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝐺 global ). However, the exact posterior distribution is intractable due to its complicated posterior expectation estimation.</p><p>To address this problem, we introduce two inference networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> (i.e., 𝑞 𝜙 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) and 𝑞 𝜙 𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 )) to approximate the posterior distributions over 𝑆 𝑡 and 𝐴 𝑡 , respectively:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) ≜ 𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 |𝑆 𝑡 -1 , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑅 𝑡 ) (inference state tracker), 𝑞 𝜙𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) ≜ 𝑞 𝜙𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 |𝑆 𝑡 , 𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑅 𝑡 ) (inference policy network),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝜙 𝑠 and 𝜙 𝑎 are parameters in inference networks.</p><p>Evidence lower bound (ELBO). At 𝑡, we derive the ELBO to optimize both prior and inference networks simultaneously as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">log 𝑝 𝜃 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝐺 global ) ≥ E 𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 -1 ) E 𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆𝑡 ) •𝑞 𝜙𝑎 (𝐴𝑡 ) [log 𝑝 𝜃𝑔 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 ) ] -KL(𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) | |𝑝 𝜃𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 )) -KL(𝑞 𝜙𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) ∥𝑝 𝜃𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 )) = -L joint ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where E( </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Collapsed inference and training</head><p>Eq. 5 provides a unified objective for optimizing all components. However, the joint distribution 𝑝 𝜃 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) •𝑝 𝜃 𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) is hard to optimize as 𝑝 𝜃 (𝐴 𝑡 ) is easily misled with incorrect sampling results of 𝑆 𝑝 𝑡 from 𝑝 𝜃 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ). To address this problem, we propose a 2-stage collapsed inference method by decomposing the objective function into 2stage optimization objectives. During the first stage, we fit 𝑝 𝜃 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) to 𝑞 𝜙 𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) to derive the ELBO (labeled by ➊ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">log 𝑝 𝜃 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝐺 global ) ≥ E 𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 -1 ) E 𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆𝑡 ) E 𝑝 𝜃𝑎 (𝐴𝑡 ) [log 𝑝 𝜃𝑔 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 ) ] -KL(𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 ) ∥𝑝 𝜃𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 )) = -L 𝑠 .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Subsequently, similar to the optimization of 𝜙 𝑠 and 𝜃 𝑠 , 𝑝 𝜃 𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) is fit 𝑞 𝜙 𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) to formulate the ELBO (labeled by ➋ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">log 𝑝 𝜃 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝐺 global ) ≥ E 𝑞 𝜙𝑠 (𝑆 𝑡 -1 ) E 𝑝 𝜃𝑠 (𝑆𝑡 ) E 𝑞 𝜙𝑎 (𝐴𝑡 ) [log 𝑝 𝜃𝑔 (𝑅 𝑡 |𝑅 𝑡 -1 , 𝑈 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐴 𝑡 ) ] -KL(𝑞 𝜙𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 ) ∥𝑝 𝜃𝑎 (𝐴 𝑡 )) = -L 𝑎 .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Accordingly, the training procedure comprises two stages when no human-annotation exist.

(RQ3) What is the effect of the length of the patient state and physician action in VRBot? (RQ4) Can VRBot provide interpretable results?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Datasets</head><p>We adopt three medical dialogue datasets for our experiments, all of which are collected from real-world medical consultation websites after data anonymization, i.e., close to clinically authentic medical scenarios. Two have been applied in previous studies, and we propose a new dataset with large-scale external knowledge.</p><p>Existing medical dialogue datasets have a limited amount of external knowledge, a limited length of dialogues, and a handful of medical departments. These constraints make it difficult to evaluate MDG approaches. To address this problem, we collect a large-scale dataset Knowledge-aware Medical conversation dataset (KaMed) from ChunyuDoctor,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> a large online Chinese medical consultation platform. The dataset caters for challenging and diverse scenarios, as it contains over 100 hospital departments with a large-scale external knowledge graph. To simulate realistic clinical conversational scenarios, in KaMed the average number of rounds of a dialogue is 11.62, much longer than existing medical dialogue datasets. Unlike other medical dialogue datasets, KaMed is equipped with large-scale external medical knowledge, crawled from CMeKG,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> the largest Chinese medical knowledge platform.</p><p>To evaluate VRBot, we also use two benchmark datasets. MedDG <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> is collected from ChunyuDoctor, related to 12 types of common gastrointestinal diseases, and provides semi-automatic annotated states and actions; the average number of rounds of a dialogue session is 9.92. MedDialog <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> is collected from an online medical platform. We filter out dialogues with fewer than three rounds, but the average number of rounds is still relatively low, only 4.76. We also collect relevant medical knowledge for the MedDG and MedDialog datasets. The dataset statistics are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Baselines and comparisons</head><p>In the context of RQ1, we write VRBot\un for the model that is only trained using annotated data. We devise a variation of VRBot by replacing the GRU encoder with Bert, and use VRBot-Bert to denote it. In the context of RQ2, we write VRBot\S for the model that eliminates the latent state variable, VRBot\A for the model that eliminates the latent action variable, VRBot\G for the model without the graph-reasoning detector, VRBot\C for the model without the context-reasoning detector, and VRBot\2s for the model without 2-stage collapsed inference (i.e., minimizing L joint in Eq. 5).</p><p>As far as we know, only Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> have addressed the same task as we do. Thus, for MDG, we use HRED-Bert <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> as a baseline, which integrates Bert <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> with the HRED model for MRG. We consider three types of baseline: open-domain dialogue generation, knowledge grounded conversations, and task-oriented dialogue generation. As open-domain approaches, we use Seq2Seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, HRED <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>, and VHRED <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref> as baselines. Seq2Seq is a sequenceto-sequence generation model with attention and copy mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>; HRED uses a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure to model the dialogue at the word-and utterance-level; VHRED extends HRED with a continuous latent variable to facilitate generation. As knowledge-grounded methods, we use CCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref>, NKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>, and PostKS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref> as baselines. CCM applies two graph attention mechanisms to augment the semantic information during response generation; NKD uses a neural knowledge diffusion module to retrieve relevant knowledge; PostKS uses dialogue context and responses to infer the posterior knowledge distribution. For taskoriented dialogue generation, we use SEDST <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>, LABES <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref>, MOSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>, and DAMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref> as baselines. SEDST formalizes the dialogue state as a text-span to copy keywords from question to state; LABES regards the state as discrete latent variables to conduct the Straight-Through Estimator for calculating the gradient; MOSS incorporates supervision from various intermediate dialogue system modules; DAMD uses GRU-based decoders to decode the state, action, and response in a supervised manner. Similar performance can be also observed in Transformer based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61]</ref>.</p></div>

Flu measures if the generated response is smooth; KC evaluates whether the response is correct; EQ measures the annotator's satisfaction with the generated response. Three annotators are asked to rate each generated response with a score range from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent) for each entry. Model names were masked out during evaluation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Overall performance</head><p>We show the automatic evaluation results for all unsupervised models on KaMed and MedDialog in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, and the semi-supervised results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>. We see in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> that VRBot significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of most evaluation metrics on both datasets. In terms of D@1 and D@2 VRBot outperforms other baselines as the generated responses in VRBot are more diverse. For KaMed, VRBot achieves an increase of 14.68%, 36.81%, 61.00%, and 67.57% over PostKS in terms of B@2, R@2, D@1, and D@2, respectively. For MedDialog, VRBot gives an increase of 21.47%, 14.17%, 31.29%, and 43.63% over PostKS. Models without reasoning give high ma-P and mi-P scores, but they do not perform well in terms of ma-R, mi-R, ma-F1, mi-F1. In terms of ma-R, mi-R, ma-F1, mi-F1, EA and EE, VRBot outperforms all baselines by a large margin. Hence, VRBot is effective in predicting physician actions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> shows the performance in semi-supervised settings on the MedDG dataset. SEDST and LABES are two state-of-the-art semi-supervised state tracking approaches. Without labeled action data, VRBot still achieves 23.35% and 26.73% improvements over LABES in terms of ma-F1 and mi-F1 with 25% labeled states; when the state labeling proportion increases to 50%, VRBot achieves an increase of 20.11% and 20.38%. VRBot outperforms VRBot\un by 12.36% and 10.36% in terms of ma-F1 and mi-F1 with the supervision proportion set to 50%; the increase is more significant with a lower supervision proportion. Thus, unlabeled data improves the performance of VRBot.</p><p>VRBot outperforms MOSS by a large margin despite the fact that MOSS can also use unlabeled data; it outperforms MOSS by 11.90% and 14.14% in terms of mi-F1 when with 25% and 50% labeled data, respectively. VRBot significantly outperforms HRED-Bert in terms of all metrics when the supervision proportion ≤ 25%. With 50% and 100% annotated data, VRBot-Bert still outperforms HRED-Bert by 12.04% and 7.93% in terms of mi-F1.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>, we perform a human evaluation on the KaMed and MedDG dataset to investigate the unsupervised and semisupervised performance of VRBot. VRBot achieves the best performance in terms of all metrics on both datasets. On KaMed, VR-Bot outperforms SEDST and PostKS in terms of KC and EQ by a large margin. The result is consistent with our automatic evaluation results, confirming the importance of simultaneously modeling patient state and physician action. On MedDG, MOSS slightly outperforms DAMD, a fully-supervised method. VRBot achieves a 13% and 15% increase over MOSS in terms of KC and EQ. Thus, the unlabeled states and actions inferred by VRBot help to improve performance. We compute the average pairwise Cohen's kappa (𝜅) to measure the consistency between annotators, and find that 0.6 ≥ 𝜅 ≥ 0.4 for all metrics.  The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Focusing on the left part, we see that mi-P decreases, while mi-R and mi-F1 increase as the state text span length grows. As |𝑆 | increases from 4 to 10, the mi-R and mi-F1 achieve 12.79% and 4.92% improvements, while mi-P decreases by  6.53%. On the right side, we see a tendency for all metrics to increase as |𝐴| increases, and the upward trend gradually slows down. As |𝐴| increases from 1 to 3, VRBot achieves 3.71%, 16.81% and 11.72% improvements in terms of mi-P, mi-R and mi-F1. The recall score rises a lot as a longer action text spans are able to present more information in the reply. As |𝐴| further increases from 3 to 5, the improvements are relatively small, i.e., 1.04% in terms of mi-F1. We have qualitatively similar findings on the KaMed dataset, which we omit due to space limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Explainability comparsion</head><p>To explicitly assess the explainability of VRBot's results, we calculate MEP and MER scores of action text spans in KaMed. We take a random sample of 50 dialogues from KaMed and manually compare the explainability performance of VRBot and PostKS. The results are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">6</ref>. We observe that VRBot outperforms PostKS by a large margin in terms of MEP and MER; our user study also shows that VRBot achieves a 44% win rate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we focus on medical dialogue response generation with a large-scale unlabeled corpus. We propose a generative model named VRBot, which uses latent variables to model unobserved patient state and physician actions. We derive the ELBO for VR-Bot and propose a 2-stage collapsed inference training trick that decomposes the ELBO into two learning objectives. Extensive experiments on three medical dialogue datasets show that VRBot achieves state-of-the-art performance on both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, in a fully-supervised setting, VRBot-Bert which is a variation of VRBot augmented by Bert achieves the best results compared to all the baselines. Analysis also confirms that VRBot is able to generate interpretable results. VRBot proves the value of having a large-scale unlabeled medical corpus. It can be also applied to other task-oriented dialogue systems with few annotated data. As to our future work, we aim to leverage the labeled data of a single hospital department to improve the MDG performance on other departments without labeled data by transfer learning or zero-shot learning.</p></div>

Starting from 𝑆 𝑝 𝑡 , we extract all the accessible nodes and edges in 𝐺 global within 𝑛 hops to get the sub-graph 𝐺 local To combine the relation type during information propagation, we employ the relational graph attention network (RGAT) [2] to represent each entity in the external knowledge graph.

𝐴𝑘  𝑡 is decoded sequentially based on a GRU decoder. To infer the prior probabilistic distribution, two reasoning detectors (i.e., a context-reasoning detector and a graph-reasoning detector) are proposed to corporately project the hidden representation of the decoder to the action space at each decoding step. The decoder is initializes as 𝒃 𝐴 𝑘,𝑝 𝑡,0 = 𝑾 At the 𝑖-th decoding step, the decoder outputs 𝒃 𝐴 𝑘,𝑝 𝑡,𝑖 . The context-reasoning detector and the graph-reasoning detector together infer 𝐴 𝑘 𝑡,𝑖 with 𝒃 𝐴 𝑘,𝑝 𝑡,𝑖 . Learning from the raw context and state, the context-reasoning detector infers the prior distribution over 𝐴 𝑘 𝑡,𝑖 using a MLP as follows:</figDesc><table /><note><p>𝑝 𝑐 is a learnable parameter. Then we draw an action category 𝐴 𝑐𝑝 𝑘 [𝒉 𝑆 𝑝 𝑡 ; 𝒉 𝑐 𝑡 ; 𝒆 𝐴 𝑐,𝑝 𝑡 ], where 𝒆 𝐴 𝑐,𝑝 𝑡 is the embedding of 𝐴 𝑐,𝑝 𝑡 .</p></note></figure>

A GRU encoder encodes 𝑅 𝑡 to 𝒉 𝑅 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑞 𝑡 to 𝒉 𝑆 𝑞 𝑡 respectively. Then we get the action category approximate posterior distribution as follows: 𝑞 𝜙 𝑎,𝑐 (𝐴 𝑐 𝑡 ).
