<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The integration of mobile learning platforms in the university context is a significant topic of interest in contemporary educational research. With the growing prevalence of mobile devices and digital technologies, these platforms have been adopted to improve accessibility and flexibility of learning. Mobile learning is the use of mobile devices to facilitate the teaching and learning process. It has transformed educational dynamics by allowing students to access educational resources at any time and place <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This modality of education not only offers flexibility in terms of time and location but also provides opportunities for personalized learning, peer collaboration, and active student participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The acceptance and adoption of mobile learning among students and teachers is a crucial research topic that has generated a significant body of literature. Theoretical models have been proposed to understand the factors that influence students' intention to use mobile learning. These models highlight elements such as previous experience with technology, perceived usefulness, and ease of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Recent research has also explored how factors such as mobile selfefficacy and 21st-century skills influence the willingness of teachers to adopt mobile learning technologies in their pedagogical practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Empirical analysis has identified reasons and perceptions that influence the adoption of mobile learning applications among students <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Investigating the changing dynamics and emerging contexts in the use of mobile learning is crucial, particularly in light of external events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand students' response to and experience with educational technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The integration of mobile devices and digital technologies in university learning environments has made mobile learning an increasingly popular topic. This is due to its potential to improve the accessibility, flexibility, and effectiveness of learning. Mobile learning allows students to access educational resources conveniently and personalize their learning experience anytime and anywhere. Its adoption is important because it can transform traditional teaching methods and facilitate the creation of more dynamic and interactive learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Recent research has investigated different aspects of mobile learning adoption in the university context. These studies have analyzed the factors that affect students' perception of mobile learning and its impact on enhancing learning. For instance, researchers have analyzed mobile learning adoption models that consider student perceptions as key determinants for improving the learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Additionally, studies have identified socioeconomic and cultural factors that influence students' attitudes towards the use of mobile devices in learning, highlighting the importance of understanding contextual differences in the adoption of these technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Understanding the factors that influence the adoption of mobile learning systems among university students is crucial for designing effective implementation and promotion strategies. Previous studies have examined the impact of theoretical models, such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the SOR (Stimulus-Organism-Response) Model, on enhancing learning through mobile learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In 2023, the adoption of mobile learning systems in the Indonesian educational context was examined, emphasizing the significance of cultural and contextual factors in their implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These studies underscore the importance of researching and understanding the adoption processes of mobile learning in the university context to optimize its potential as an educational tool.</p><p>The topic analyzed in this study has gaps that require attention and systematic analysis. Although various systematic reviews have been carried out in the field of mobile learning adoption, there is a need to delve into current trends and the factors that influence the acceptance and use of these technologies in specific university environments. For instance, while studies like Kumar and Chand <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Alsharida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have explored the general adoption of mobile learning, further research is needed to examine how factors such as technostress and compatibility can impact the adoption of mobile learning among foreign language learners, as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Wang et al.</ref> (insert year here). These gaps in the literature justify conducting a systematic review in 2022 that integrates and critically analyzes the available evidence. This will allow for the identification of emerging research areas and contribute to the theoretical and practical development of mobile learning adoption in specific university contexts. The purpose of this study is to analyze research trends in the adoption of mobile learning in the university context from 2013 to 2024. The following questions will guide the research: RQ1: What are the primary data collection instruments utilized in articles regarding the implementation of mobile learning in university settings?</p><p>RQ2: In what geographical contexts has the implementation of mobile learning in university settings been studied?</p><p>RQ3: What are the various population segments that have been the focus of research on the implementation of mobile learning in university settings?</p><p>RQ4: What psychobehavioral theories are used to understand the adoption of mobile learning in the university context?</p><p>RQ5: What are the primary latent variables or constructs used to comprehend the adoption of mobile learning in the university context?</p><p>This study compiles and synthesizes various theories, variables, and models used to understand the adoption of mobile learning in university educational environments. The aim is to identify predominant trends and approaches in research and offer a comprehensive vision of the factors that influence the acceptance and use of mobile learning in different university contexts worldwide. The study provides a solid foundation for building a unified mobile learning adoption model.</p><p>This study aims to identify the countries and populations that have been researched in this field. Recognizing geographical and demographic variations in the implementation and acceptance of this educational modality is important. The goal is to develop a conceptual framework based on the unified model that is applicable and relevant in various cultural and socioeconomic contexts. This integrative approach enables us to advance the theoretical understanding of mobile learning adoption in higher education and inform more effective and contextualized educational implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology</head><p>Exploratory research was conducted using secondary sources. The methodology was based on the parameters and guidelines established by the PRISMA-2020 declaration, which provides a rigorous and transparent framework for conducting and presenting systematic reviews. Relevant studies were carefully selected, and key data were extracted to explore the factors that influence the adoption of mobile learning in specific university environments. This allowed for the identification of trends, research gaps, and areas of interest for future research in this emerging field of digital education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Eligibility criteria</head><p>The eligibility criteria are divided into two sections. The first section includes inclusion criteria that mainly focus on titles and keywords as metadata. Specifically, it looks for the combination of terms such as 'mobile learning' and 'university' in various forms of citation, including variations such as 'm-learning' and 'mobile learning'. These criteria allow for an exhaustive and precise search for relevant studies that address the adoption of mobile learning in university environments, ensuring the inclusion of the most relevant literature for analysis.</p><p>The exclusion process involves three phases. The first phase excludes all records with erroneous indexing or those not directly related to the study's topic. The second phase of exclusion aims to eliminate all documents for which full text access is not available. This phase applies only to Systematic Literature Reviews since the review in question focuses exclusively on the analysis of metadata. Finally, the third phase, the Exclusion phase, is responsible for discarding documents that do not present a clearly defined or explicit mobile learning adoption model. These exclusion criteria ensure the rigor and quality of the ongoing systematic literature review's study selection process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Source of information</head><p>The Scopus and Web of Science databases were chosen as the primary sources of information. Scopus and Web of Science are considered the main bibliometric databases today due to their wide coverage and reputation in the academic and scientific fields. Research, such as that conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, has compared the quality and coverage of different bibliometric databases, concluding that Scopus and Web of Science are two of the most complete and reliable platforms available. Similarly, Tennant <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> conducted a study comparing the quality and coverage of different bibliometric databases, contributing to the understanding of the scope of platforms such as Scopus and Web of Science in the field of scientific knowledge collection. Although it is important to acknowledge that no database is entirely comprehensive, both Scopus and Web of Science provide a broad selection of academic and scientific journals, along with advanced search and analysis tools, making them ideal options for conducting a systematic literature review in a university setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Search strategy</head><p>To facilitate the search for relevant studies in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, two specialized search equations were designed. These equations were adapted to the defined inclusion criteria and the search characteristics of each platform. They were meticulously developed to ensure comprehensiveness and precision in identifying relevant articles on the adoption of mobile learning in the university context. The search equations were materialized on January 30, 2024, taking advantage of the advanced search functionalities of both databases to maximize the collection of relevant literature in the field of study.</p><p>For the Scopus database: (TITLE (("mobile learning") OR (mlearning) OR (m-learning)) AND TITLE (student OR scholar OR undergraduate OR learner) AND TITLE ((adoption) OR (use) OR (acceptance) OR tam OR tpb OR utaut)) OR (KEY (("mobile learning") OR (mlearning) OR (m-learning)) AND KEY (student OR scholar OR undergraduate OR learner) AND KEY ((adoption) OR (use) OR (acceptance) OR tam OR tpb OR utaut))</p><p>For the Web of Science database: (TI = (("mobile learning") OR (mlearning) OR (m-learning)) AND TI = (student OR scholar OR undergraduate OR learner) AND TI = ((adoption) OR (use) OR (acceptance) OR TAM OR TPB OR UTAUT)) OR (AK = (("mobile learning") OR (mlearning) OR (m-learning)) AND AK = (student OR scholar OR undergraduate OR learner) AND AK = ((adoption) OR (use) OR (acceptance) OR TAM OR TPB OR UTAUT))</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Data management</head><p>The study utilized the Microsoft Excel1 tool to extract, store, and process information from selected databases. This tool provided an organized structure to record relevant data from identified studies, allowing for efficient subsequent analysis. Each article obtained from the databases underwent an extensive and thorough full-text review to identify its relevance, contributions, and findings regarding the adoption of mobile learning in university settings. This systematic and detailed approach ensured completeness and quality in the collection and analysis of scientific literature relevant to the study's topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Selection process</head><p>Following the PRISMA 2020 statement guidelines, it is crucial to utilize internal automatic classifiers to facilitate the systematic literature review study selection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This practice helps to mitigate the risk of missing studies or incorrect classifications when applying inclusion and exclusion criteria more efficiently. Additionally, it is essential to validate these classifiers internally or externally to understand and control the risk of bias in study selection. In this study, we utilized an automation tool created in Microsoft Excel1 as an internal classifier. All researchers involved in the study independently applied this tool during the study selection process, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This approach helped to minimize the risk of missing studies or incorrect classifications by converging the results and carefully reviewing the extracted metadata.</p><p>Furthermore, we used a specific Microsoft Excel1 tool to homogenize all the articles extracted from both sources of information. This facilitated the process of excluding duplicates and applying the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This ensures clear and unambiguous identification of the texts that will be analyzed in-depth for this systematic literature review. It guarantees consistency in the selection process mentioned earlier and contributes to the study's integrity and validity by minimizing the risk of missing relevant studies or making incorrect classifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Data collection process</head><p>As per the guidelines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, it is essential to specify the methods employed for collecting data from reports in a systematic literature review. In this study on the adoption of mobile learning in the university context, we used Microsoft Excel1 as an automated tool for data collection from the selected databases, Scopus and Web of Science. The authors acted as reviewers for data validation, with each author conducting an independent evaluation to ensure an objective and thorough assessment of the information extracted from the studies. Subsequently, the authors collectively confirmed the data, comparing and contrasting the results obtained by each reviewer. The process was developed until achieving absolute convergence in the results, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the data collected in the literature review systematics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Data elements</head><p>The objective was to gather data from all articles that met the research objective, which required adherence to the specialized search equation created for each database. This involved searching for results related to the implementation of mobile learning in the university context. The selected texts covered relevant measurements, time points, and analyses. However, if any information was missing or unclear, it was excluded as 'non-relevant texts' since they do not contribute to the understanding of knowledge on the topic. The purpose and scope of the research were considered to ensure consistency, allowing for the inclusion of significant and relevant results for the analysis of the adoption of mobile learning in the university context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">Assessment of the risk of bias of the study</head><p>The process of assessing the risk of bias in the included studies was a collaborative effort among all authors. The authors used the same automated Microsoft Excel1 tool for data collection and evaluation of included studies. Each author independently assessed the studies using predefined criteria to identify potential sources of bias. The use of this automated tool standardized the evaluation process, ensuring the quality and integrity of the results. This comprehensive and rigorous approach contributed to the validity and reliability of the systematic literature review on the adoption of mobile learning in the university context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">Measures of effect</head><p>It is relevant to specify that the effect measures traditionally used in primary research, such as the risk ratio or the difference in means, are not applicable in the analysis of secondary research sources. In this study, variables related to the data collection instruments, the geographical context of application of the study, the target population, the psychobehavioral theory used and latent variables within each evaluated model are analyzed. These aspects are addressed through the use of Microsoft Excel1 to organize and analyze the data, as well as the use of VOSviewer1 to determine thematic associations between the selected studies, this allows a deeper and more holistic understanding of the adoption of mobile learning in the university context, expanding the scope beyond conventional effect measures and providing a comprehensive view of the factors that influence this educational phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10.">Synthesis methods</head><p>It was established that all the studies included in the analysis had to be open access to ensure the availability of the full text and facilitate a thorough examination of each article. The data extracted from the selected studies were then stored in Microsoft Excel1. This tool provided a centralized platform to systematically tabulate and organize information, allowing for the comparison of study characteristics, preparation of data for presentation and synthesis, and efficient and coherent display of results. The use of Microsoft Excel1 as a data management tool contributed to the rigorous organization and structured analysis of the information collected in this systematic review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.11.">Assessment of reporting bias</head><p>When conducting a systematic literature review, it is important to be aware of potential biases towards certain synonyms found in thesauri, such as the IEEE. These biases may influence inclusion criteria, search strategy, and data collection, which could result in the exclusion of relevant studies that use alternative terms to describe the concept of mobile learning adoption. Additionally, excluding texts without a defined adoption model may lead to the omission of valuable information that could contribute to the understanding and construction of knowledge on the subject. Therefore, it is essential to take steps to mitigate the impact of these potential biases on the systematic literature review process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.12.">Certainty evaluation</head><p>As part of this systematic investigation, we comprehensively and exhaustively evaluated the certainty of the body of evidence. We applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to each study to determine the suitability of the selected articles. Additionally, we conducted an individual evaluation of each article to identify any possible methodological biases or limitations of the study. These aspects were mentioned in both the description of the methodological designs and the discussion of the study's limitations. This contributed to a comprehensive evaluation of the certainty of the body of evidence, ensuring the transparency and reliability of the results obtained in the systematic review of literature on the adoption of mobile learning in university contexts (see <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>.</p><p>In this systematic literature review, the selection and exclusion of studies were carried out in several stages. First, we conducted an exhaustive search in selected information sources to identify relevant studies. Then, we eliminated duplicate records to ensure data integrity. Finally, we proceeded with the selection and exclusion of studies based on pre-defined criteria. Three exclusion phases were carried out, applying predefined criteria to discard studies that did not meet the research objectives and scope. After this rigorous selection process, 44 articles were included as pertinent and relevant to address the issue of mobile learning adoption in the university context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>The results section provides a comprehensive overview of the findings obtained from the systematic analysis of the relevant literature. This section presents the main emerging results of the review in an organized and structured manner. It addresses key aspects such as the instruments used for data collection, the geographical contexts where the phenomenon has been studied, the population segments under investigation, the theoretical models used, and the latent variables or constructs identified.</p><p>This systematic literature review examines the adoption of mobile learning in university environments, following the parameters established by the PRISMA-2020 declaration.
