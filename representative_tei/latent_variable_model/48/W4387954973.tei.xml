<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study presents a collection of purely data-driven workflows for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) for distributed dynamical systems. The ROMs we focus on, are data-assisted models inspired by, and templated upon, the theory of Approximate Inertial Manifolds (AIMs); the particular motivation is the so-called post-processing Galerkin method of Garcia-Archilla, Novo and Titi. Its applicability can be extended: the need for accurate truncated Galerkin projections and for deriving closed-formed corrections can be circumvented using machine learning tools. When the right latent variables are not a priori known, we illustrate how autoencoders as well as Diffusion Maps (a manifold learning scheme) can be used to discover good sets of latent variables and test their explainability. The proposed methodology can express the ROMs in terms of (a) theoretical (Fourier coefficients), (b) linear data-driven (POD modes) and/or (c) nonlinear data-driven (Diffusion Maps) coordinates. Both Black-Box and (theoretically-informed and data-corrected) Gray-Box models are described; the necessity for the latter arises when truncated Galerkin projections are so inaccurate as to not be amenable to post-processing. We use the Chafee-Infante reaction-diffusion and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dissipative partial differential equations to illustrate and successfully test the overall framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Separation of time-scales in dynamical systems is crucial toward the development of Reduced Order Models (ROMs). For a certain class of dissipative evolution equations, the long term dynamics are attracted exponentially fast to smooth invariant objects known as inertial manifolds (IMs), facilitating the construction of ROMs on those. The dynamics on the IM can be described by the Inertial Form (a finite ODE system), which accurately captures the long-term behavior of the original infinite-dimensional system <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[Shvartsman and Kevrekidis, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Jolly et al., 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">, Titi, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Akram et al., 2020]</ref>. The purpose of this paper is to (somewhat systematically) outline (and demonstrate) links between "traditional" AIM technology and contemporary data-driven reduction tools, giving rise to "mathematics-assisted" algorithmic ROM workflows. Such connections had initially been experimentally attempted in the 1990s (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Krischer et al. [1993]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Theodoropoulos et al. [2000]</ref>); they are currently experiencing a strong revival due to the explosion in machine-learning-assisted modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Linot and Graham, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Anirudh et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Lee and Carlberg, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Bar-Sinai et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Benner et al., 2015]</ref>.</p><p>IMs have been proven to exist for only a few systems, and even then, they have not been constructed explicitly <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Jolly et al., 1990]</ref>. It is, nevertheless, still possible to find approximations of either the global attractor or the IM itself, i.e. Approximate Inertial Manifolds (AIMs), or the dynamics on it, i.e. the Approximate Inertial Form (AIF), and then track the dynamics in this reduced space. The key ansatz is that the attracting dynamics in the complement space to the AIM, are quickly slaved to, and embodied in, the AIF. Along these lines, the Galerkin projection, as well as nonlinear Galerkin projections on approximate inertial manifolds are also popular choices for reduced order modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[Marion and Temam, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Jolly et al., 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Shen, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Benner et al., 2015]</ref>. AIM-based ROMs have been proposed for reaction-diffusion systems <ref type="bibr">[Foias et al., 1988b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Adrover et al., 2002]</ref>, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation <ref type="bibr">[Foias et al., 1988b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Jolly et al., 1990]</ref>, the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations <ref type="bibr">[Temam, 1989b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">,a, Jauberteau et al., 1990]</ref>, and for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Guermond and Prudhomme, 2008]</ref>.</p><p>It must also be noted, that, for a dissipative PDE, in the case where a clear time-scale separation exists, we converge to the inertial manifold exponentially fast. In the absence of a large separation we still converge, exponentially fast, to a thin layer around some manifold, also called an approximate inertial manifold. The dynamics in this case are exponentially fast attracted to this layer (that contains the attractor) but, once the trajectory enters the layer it may "take forever" to arrive to the attractor.</p><p>In the late 90s the post-processing Galerkin method was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[García-Archilla et al., 1998, García-Archilla and</ref><ref type="bibr">Titi, 1999]</ref>, initially in the context of dissipative equations. Post-processing Galerkin takes into account the observation that the error between the result of integrating a truncated Galerkin on the one hand, and the projection of the true solution in the finite-dimensional Galerkin space, on the other, is significantly smaller than the error between the truncated Galerkin and the full solution (superconvergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[García-Archilla et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Wahlbin, 2006]</ref>). We will return to this below and illustrate it in Sec. 4 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Given this observation, one uses the dynamics expressed only in terms of the leading low modes (a truncated version of the equations) to integrate. Once the time integration is finished one can post-process the obtained solution by approximating the high modes as a function of the solution in the leading modes. Since, in the post-processing Galerkin framework, the correction is computed only at the end of time integration, this makes it much cheaper to implement computationally than true nonlinear Galerkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[García-Archilla et al., 1998, García-Archilla and</ref><ref type="bibr">Titi, 1999]</ref>. Moreover, truncation analysis derivation of the spectral method for dissipative evolution equations, such as the Navies-Stokes equations, gives rise to the post-processing Galerkin as the leading order numerical scheme, and not the Galerkin scheme itself, as commonly believed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[Margolin et al., 2003]</ref>.</p><p>Model identification assisted by machine-learning has emerged in the 90s and is now experiencing a rebirth as a tool to discover minimal parametrizations of an IM, which can subsequently be used to evolve the dynamical system in a reduced space <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Lu et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Chorin and Lu, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Zeng and Graham, 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Zeng et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, De Jesús and Graham, 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Linot et al., 2023]</ref>. Some efforts implemented linear methods like POD <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Krischer et al., 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Kang et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Theodoropoulos et al., 2000]</ref>, to identify a suitable subspace that contains the majority of the variance of the system, and parametrizes the long term dynamics. More recently, operator inference with quadratic manifolds has been proposed for model reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Geelen et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Zastrow et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Qian et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, McQuarrie et al., 2021]</ref>. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, such as autoencoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Kramer, 1991]</ref> or Diffusion Maps (DMAPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Coifman et al., 2008]</ref> have also been used to discover latent variables of data that originally live in a highdimensional space. Learning a dynamical system in the latent space of an autoencoder (even as a collection of local charts), or in Diffusion Maps space, also provides a systematic approach to ROM construction (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rico-Martinez et al. [1992]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sonday et al. [2010]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Evangelou et al. [2023]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Linot and Graham [2022]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee and Carlberg [2020]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bar-Sinai et al. [2019]</ref>). Needless to say, nonlinear system identification assisted by machine learning remains a very active current research endeavor, encompassing a plethora of directions from symbolic methods e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Brunton et al., 2016]</ref>, to physics-informed methods, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[Raissi et al., 2019]</ref>, to numerics-informed methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Bar-Sinai et al., 2019]</ref>.</p><p>In our view, the "1980s" IM and AIM efforts towards useful reduced order models of dissipative PDEs can be succinctly summarized as follows: Given the functional form of the PDE for which we know (or believe) an IM exists, and having an estimate of the dimensionality of said manifold:</p><p>(A) start by finding the (leading) eigenmodes, say k of them, of the (dissipative part of the) operator that "determines" (parametrizes) the IM. In that sense, the components of the solution in the remaining "higher order" eigenmodes can be expressed as functions of the components in the lower, determining, ones;</p><p>(B) guided by separation of time scales ideas, construct the AIM approximating this function, by writing the components of the higher eigenmodes as (approximate) functions of the components of the lower, determining ones. Several implementable such approximations have been proposed and analysed: e.g. the "steady" manifold, the "Euler-Galerkin", and the Foias-Manley-Temam (FMT) manifold among others. We already have a practical result: if somebody provides as observations the lower mode amplitudes, we can meaningfully and analytically improve the full spatiotemporal solution, complementing it with the recovered higher mode components. We will return to this theme when discussing post-processing Galerkin. Let it be noted here that even though the original motivation of AIM was to find an approximation to the IM whenever the latter exists, however, this idea was generalized later and implemented by finding a manifold which approximates the global attractor as a set; observing that global attractor always exists for genuine dissipative dynamical system;</p><p>(C) beyond just correcting such observations, these functions can be used to correct approximations of the dynamics through their low-order Galerkin truncation: From an accurate, high-order Galerkin truncation, we keep only the low, "determining" Galerkin ODEs; instead of omitting the higher order terms as negligible, we now substitute the AIM function in the low terms. We now have the "steady", or "Euler-Galerkin" or FMT inertial forms.</p><p>This original program is complemented by the "post-processing Galerkin" protocol: Here we actually keep the low order Galerkin truncation, ignoring the contribution of the higher order, slaved modes to it, expecting/believing that, in its low-dimensional space, these few ODEs are accurate enough to approximate the projection of the exact solution on the Galerkin space. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[García-Archilla et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, García-Archilla and Titi, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, García-Archilla et al., 1999]</ref> took into account the observation that the total error of the solutions predicted by the truncated low-order Galerkin is appreciably larger than the error after adding to them (in a sense, "reinjecting") the AIM-approximated higher order solution components. This reinjection is performed after the truncated low-order Galerkin equations have been integrated until each time instance of interest (we remind the reader that this is revisited in Sec. 4 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</p><p>They named the approach "post-processing Galerkin" since it takes place after the truncated low-order Galerkin has been obtained and integrated: it is these concrete available solutions of the model that are being improved -not the model itself.</p><p>Explicit AIMs have been obtained in the context of spectral Galerkin approximation by writing approximations of the evolution equation of the high modes in terms of the low modes, a closure relation. In the context of spectral Galerkin approximation based on Fourier modes or eigenfunctions of the Stokes operator, one can naturally decouple the phase space into low Fourier (eigenfunctions) modes and their complement high Fourier (eigenfunctions) modes. Therefore, the above-described strategy of obtaining AIM is possible to be executed explicitly, and leads to an analytical closure.</p><p>For the examples we present in this work, the spectral Galerkin approximation could indeed provide a desirable closure.</p><p>However, we would like to note that in the context of the Finite Element Galerkin method, the above decomposition to coarse spatial scales and their complement is not a straightforward task. Therefore the above strategy can not be followed to obtain an explicit (paper and pencil) closure form, that expresses the fine spatial scales of the solution in terms of the coarse finite elements spatial scales. For this case, a more general framework for implementing the Post-processing Galerkin can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[García-Archilla and Titi, 1999]</ref>. In this more general case, an explicit form of an AIM in order to implement post-processing Galerkin is not required. We briefly present this more general scheme in Sec A.0.1.</p><p>The innovation of this work, as it progresses beyond symbolic model (AIM) or solution (post-processing Galerkin) improvement, is the introduction of data-driven methods that allow us (given accurate simulation data or observations), to efficiently address the following issues:</p><p>(a) Estimate the AIM dimensionality in a data-driven way (either through autoencoders or through manifold learning).</p><p>(b) Learn good reduced AIFs (the "correct", nonlinear Galerkin, right hand-side of the reduced, low order, components of the PDE) in a data-driven way.</p><p>(c) Learn the AIM functions (high order mode components as a function of low order model components) in a data driven way.</p><p>(d) Given the learned AIM in (c), correct the solutions of a low-order Galerkin truncation (a "data driven" postprocessing Galerkin).</p><p>Beyond the steps (b-d) above, that more or less correspond to the traditional (A-C) analytical steps, a couple of very useful data-driven "twists" are introduced.</p><p>(e) Circumvent the assumption of accuracy of the low-order (linear) Galerkin truncation; the low order AIF is learned from observations of the low-order components of accurate full PDE dynamics; and now the "postprocessing" that follows can be done (1) with the same "old" analytical AIMs, or, interestingly (2) with data-driven learned AIMs from the same accurate full PDE dynamics.</p><p>(f) Gray-Box (in some sense "physics-assisted") learning: instead of a fully black-box learning of the AIF using PDE observations, we now learn the correction of the not-so-quantitative low-order linear Galerkin trunca-tion. This correction can be learned as an additive (residual) term, or even as a functional correction -hoping for easier training, since what is learned is a perturbation of the identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[Martin-Linares et al., 2023]</ref>.</p><p>(g) (This is not so much a step in our list, as a branching towards new capabilities). Up to now, everything but the eigenfunctions parametrizing the manifold was data-driven; the eigenfunctions themselves were still analytical. If we allow ourselves to find the parametrization of the manifold in a data-driven way, two individually significant new options arise:</p><p>(i) Use linear data-driven eigenfunctions: the leading Principal Components (PODs) of the full accurate PDE simulations. Now the low-order PODs parametrize the manifold, and the higher order POD components embody the AIM. POD-Galerkin takes the place of traditional Galerkin. (ii) Use a nonlinear, data-driven AIM parametrization and either:</p><p>• use the latent variables of an autoencoder to parametrize the AIM, learn the corresponding accurate AIF, and post-process it to more accurate spatiotemporal PDE solution reconstruction; • use the leading POD components to parametrize the AIM, learn the accurate corresponding AIF, and post-process it for a more accurate spatiotemporal PDE solution reconstruction. At the risk of making this list ridiculously long, we also add -and illustrate below-the possibility • of using spectral (Diffusion Map) data mining to parametrize the AIM along with the associated Geometric Harmonics for the post-processing.</p><p>A schematic overview of the different options proposed in each case, are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, with references to the subsequent sections where they are discussed in detail.  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After listing the illustrative examples used in this study (Sec 2), we proceed with describing the methodology (Sec. 3.) We start with briefly reviewing the "traditional" approximations of IMs and IFs (and AIMs and AIFs) (Sec. 3.1). We then discuss neural network-based alternatives to approximating IMs and IFs (Sec. 3.1.2), followed by nonlinear manifold learning methods for determining the dimensionality and parametrization of the latent space (Sec. 3.2.1 and 3.2.2). After presenting our results we conclude by pointing out that the technology can be easily "transferred" to POD parametrizations of the IM (Sec. 3.2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data on</head><p>2 Illustrative examples: The Chafee-Infante and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations Our first example is the reaction-diffusion Chafee-Infante partial differential equation (PDE), for which the dimensionality of the Inertial Manifold (IM), for the parameter range of interest, is known; it reads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u t = u -u 3 + νu xx .</formula><p>(1)</p><p>The parameter ν was chosen as ν = 0.16 and Dirichlet boundary conditions, u(0, t) = u(π, t) = 0, were used. The Chafee-Infante PDE, for ν = 0.16, has been shown to have a two-dimensional inertial manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[Sonday, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Gear et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Jolly, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Evangelou et al., 2022]</ref>. To simulate the dynamics on/near this two-dimensional manifold, the Galerkin projection</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u(x, t) ≈ 3 k=1 α k (t)sin(kx)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Gear et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Jolly, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Evangelou et al., 2022]</ref>. The first two leading sine coefficients α 1 (t), α 2 (t) are sufficient to parameterize this two-dimensional manifold, and Galerkin equations based only on the first two modes provide a qualitatively correct approximation of the dynamics in these two modes. We will consider the solution of the Chafee-Infante equation with three modes as the ground truth (cf Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>). For the post-processing process, the truncated equations with the first two sine coefficients α = {α 1 , α 2 } are the ones used for integration up to time t = T . Then, their solution is post-processed to recover α = α 3 and reconstruct the full solution u(x, T ). For this first example, the truncated dynamics governed by the first two sine coefficients are (considered to be) qualitatively, but not quantitavely accurate; the post-processing step aims to correct the obtained solution from these truncated dynamics.</p><p>To demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology in a case with more complex dynamics, we select the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) PDE,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u t = -ν(uu x + u xx ) -4u xxxx ; for x ∈ [0, 2π].<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The KS (Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>)) is a prototypical equation with dynamics that include chaos, derived in the context of a diverse range of physical systems such as, but not limited to, thin film flow on inclined planes and instabilities in a laminar flame front <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Kuramoto and Tsuzuki, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Sivashinsky, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Alekseenko et al., 1985</ref><ref type="bibr">, Chang, 1986a</ref><ref type="bibr">,b, Jolly et al., 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kevrekidis et al., 1990]</ref>. The parameter ν in our case is set to ν = 33 and periodic boundary conditions are used u(0, t) = u(2π, t). In this example, Fourier series expansion with 8 terms is used to approximate the ground truth u(x, t):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u(x, t) ≈ 8 k=1 α k (t)sin(kx) + β k (t)cos(kx); x ∈ [0, 2π],<label>(4)</label></formula><p>which results in 8 ODEs for the sine coefficients ({α k } 8 k=1 ) and 8 for the cosine coefficients ({β k } 8 k=1 ). Restriction to the space of odd functions leads to retaining only the sine terms, resulting in a system of 8 ODEs for the sine coefficients which is considered, in this work, as the exact solution of the KS. We use the truncation to the leading three sine coefficients α = {α 1 , α 2 , α 3 } to study the dynamics for ν = 33; however even though it has been shown that a 3D manifold exists, the truncated equations based on the leading coefficients do not provide an accurate approximation of the dynamics of these coefficients. In this case the traditional post-processing Galerkin methodology, does not apply (we do not have a good base solution to correct). We circumvent this issue by constructing Gray-Box models, as we show below in Sec. 4.3.1.</p></div>

The top row shows the predicted right-hand-side from the three sine coefficients resulting from the autoencoder, with M SE = 9.5. The respective predictions from the Double DMAPs reconstruction are shown on the bottom row, with M SE = 2.2.</p><p>The neural network-derived approximation is then used in conjunction with an ODE solver, such as the Runge-Kutta, in order to integrate in time. The outcome of integration is reconstructed in physical space and compared to the outcome of the ground truth integration (in 8D) and also the reconstructed solution using only the first three modes of the ground truth. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>, alongside the error between the learned 3D ODE and the actual 3 modes of the Galerkin approximation, which demonstrates that the learned ODE predicts accurately the low dimensional time evolution of the first three modes. It is worth looking into the time evolution of the first three modes, α 1 , α 2 and α 3 that result from the truncated 3D dynamics and compare it to the evolution of the first three terms of the full 8D dynamics and those of the learned AIF ODE. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref>, where it becomes evident that the first three terms of the learned 3D ODE are close to the trajectory of the first three terms of the 8D Galerkin. In contrast, the truncated 3D dynamics deviate significantly, past a certain point in time, from the ground truth dynamics. This observation suggests that using a post-processing scheme directly on the truncated equations won't be able to correct the dynamics. This motivates us to use an ML correction so-called "Gray-Box" model discussed further in the next section.</p><p>In essence, the post-processing Galerkin method relies on the premise that the solution of the truncated problem is reasonably close to the projection of the ground truth solution. Here it is demonstrated that even though the AIM is indeed three-dimensional, in the range of physical parameters examined, the truncated long term dynamics in three dimensional space are not accurate. This is demonstrated further in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>, where the solution in physical space is reconstructed from the 8D Galerkin, the 3D Galerkin and the learned 3D AIF ODEs, in different instances along the same trajectory. At initial stages of the trajectory, the solutions of the three methods are reasonably close, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13a</ref>. Later in time, the truncated 3D solution is growing quantitatively further apart from the ground truth, whereas the learned 3D AIF ODE follows closely the 8D dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13b</ref>). This is made clear in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13c</ref>, where the relative error between the learned and the truncated 3D solution is plotted along the trajectory. This can also be observed in phase space shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13d</ref>, on the right. The red point corresponds to the initial condition. The values of sine coefficients initially evolve in a similar manner but eventually, the truncated 3D dynamics deviate.</p></div>

To start with, the POD modes that contain the greatest percentage of variance of an ensemble of solutions in physical space, are identified. Three POD modes represent 99.99% of the energy of the dataset (cf.

The mean absolute percentage error of the dataset, projected on a basis consisting of 3 POD vectors, is 0.06% (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16b</ref>). We use this collection of POD coefficients, to discover the latent variables, here with an autoencoder with a 2-neuron bottleneck layer. The mean absolute percentage error achieved for the autoencoderreconstructed POD coefficients is 1.2%. The latent variables are one-to-one with the two leading POD coefficients, as is evident in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">17</ref>, where they are plotted and coloured according to the values of the coefficients. The smooth colour transition is indicative of the one-to-one relationship.</p><p>The time-evolution law of the ODE for the two leading POD coefficients, is then learned from data. This is achieved using a feed forward neural network consisting of two hidden layers with 20 neurons each. The tanh activation function is implemented and the mean squared error is used as a loss function. The learned ODE is integrated with a Runge-Kutta solver over time T = 5. From the values of the two POD coefficients at the final time-step, the latent variables are then inferred using an appropriately trained neural network. Then, the decoder of the autoencoder is used to recover the entire set of POD coefficients. It is then possible to "lift" from POD space to the sine coefficients and reconstruct the solution: the solution reconstructed using 3 ML-derived terms compares very favorably to the ground   Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19</ref>: (a) A data set sampled from the singularly perturbed system of ODEs is shown with a black solid line.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion-Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, this study has attempted to bridge theoretical approaches to reduced order modeling of dynamical systems (theoretically, closed form, approximations of AIMs and AIFs) with appropriately derived data-driven workflows. The data in question may consist of either (a) theoretical parametrizations of the IM (here sine coefficients) or (b) equally possibly, data-driven parametrizations (POD coefficients, autoencoder latent variables, manifold learning Diffusion Map coordinates). The use of machine learning techniques, specifically autoencoders and Diffusion Maps, allows for accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional systems while overcoming the limitations of traditional post-processing Galerkin methods.</p><p>Moreover, the proposed approach has demonstrated promising results in scenarios where the low-dimensional ROM significantly deviates from the correct long-term dynamics, which was previously challenging to address with postprocessing Galerkin techniques. The introduction of a "Gray-Box" model that adds a correction to the truncated Galerkin helps it regain its accuracy; it then allows for post-processing steps to recover even higher levels of accuracy, in ambient space.</p><p>At this point, it is worth discussing how noise affects the robustness of the different methods; regarding the DMapsbased approaches, the question of noisy data has been addressed in detail in the paper by <ref type="bibr">Coifman and Lafon Coifman and Lafon [2006b]</ref>: the DMaps parametrization will be robust to output noise as long as the scale parameter √ ϵ, in the denominator of equation ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) in the Appendix, remains larger than the amplitude of the noise. Therefore, as long as the scale parameter is larger than the noise (and the noise is not large enough to distort the manifold) we expect the embedding to remain consistent. Along these lines, a more rigorous means of selection of this parameter was recently introduced in order to handle noisy data, based on a semigroup property for parameter tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shan and Daubechies [2022]</ref>. Autoencoders, have been used for denoising data; therefore, we expect them capable of handling data with small amplitudes of noise and act as filters to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vincent et al. [2008]</ref>.</p><p>For the Post-processing Galerkin, we assume that noise affects the solution in the same way that error in the truncated Galerkin. An error of the order ||e m || in the computed Galerkin method yields an error of the O(m -α2 ) + ||e m ||, where O(m -α2 ) is the error between the exact solution of the system and the post-processing Galerkin based on the exactly computed solution of the Galerkin system, u m . Therefore one has to require ||e m || = O(m -α2 ) in order to conclude robustness of the post-Processing Galerkin method with respect to errors commited in the computed Galerkin method. Exploiting this analysis we can also conclude that, by analogy, if we have noise of size smaller or equal to O(m -α2 ) on the results of the truncated Galerkin we will also retain the robustness of the post-processing Galerkin (and our approach). A detailed analysis along these lines in presented in section A.0.2.</p><p>Overall, this work contributes to the growing body of literature on data-driven reduced order modeling techniques for dynamical systems and provides a valuable alternative to traditional post-processing Galerkin methods. The proposed workflows have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of reduced order models, which has important implications for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, and climate modeling.</p><p>A promising future direction of our current work for the construction of reduced-order models is the combination of data-driven techniques with physics-based techniques. The work of R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Geelen et al. Geelen et al. [2023]</ref>, in which the parameterization of the data is achieved by combining linear subspaces -spanned by the first few POD vectors -and quadratic components, is the most pertinent to this direction. One could express the dynamics in terms of the first few POD vectors and use the quadratic correction only as a post-processing step to obtain a more accurate reconstruction at the end of the integration. The ability to find a quadratic correction could provide improved explainability to the post-processing step, that we lose by learning a black-box post-processing step in our current work. A visualizable example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19</ref> where the 2-dimensional singularly perturbed system ( ẋ = 2 -x -y; ẏ = 1/ϵ(x -y)) was used to sample data. For this example one could write the dynamics in terms of P OD 1 and express the correction from P OD 2 = f (P OD 1 ) through a quadratic correction since P OD 2 can be seen as a quadratic function of P OD 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19(b)</ref>).</p><p>The term -9α 3 ν of the right-hand side of Equation ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) corresponds to the diffusion term and all the other terms of the right-hand side to the reaction terms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Appendix</head><p>A.0.1 Post-processing Galerkin for the finite element Method Let X be the phase space of a nonlinear dissipative evolution equation of the form du dt + νAu = F (u).</p><p>Let X H be a finite dimensional (e.g. finite element) space of spatial scale H with P H : X → X H an orthogonal projection. The Galerkin approximate solution u H ∈ X H satisfies the equation</p><p>Therefore, for a given Galerkin solution u H and its time-derivative du H dt over the interval [0, T ], the post-processing Galekin solution is a function v ∈ X (notice it is not in the complement of X H , i.e. not in X ⊖ X H , but in X, so v involves both coarse as well as fine spatial scales), such that v satisfies</p><p>The right-hand side is a given function at time t = T , and v solves a linear elliptic equation. However, in practice we solve an approximation of v say ṽ ∈ X h , where h ≪ H, and X h is a finer finite element space</p><p>A.0.2 Euler-Galerkin algorithm applied to Chafee-Infante PDE</p><p>The implementation of the Euler-Galerkin algorithm described in Sec. 3.1.1 is shown here for the Chafee-Infante reaction-diffusion equation. For this PDE, as discussed in Sec. 4.1, a two-dimensional inertial manifold exists (n = 2) parameterized by the first two sine Fourier modes α 1 , α 2 . By using the Galerkin projection u(x, t) ≈ m=3 i=1 a i (t)sin(ix) a system of three coupled ordinary differential equations is derived. The derived system of equations reads</p><p>As we stated above, the dissipative evolution equation will still possess a global attractor. Even though in this case we are unable to show the existence of an invariant IM that contains the global attractor, we are able to construct a k-dimensional Lipschitz manifold, that is still called an AIM. At the moment k is an arbitrary positive integer.</p><p>In fact, one can construct the AIM M 0 = graph(Φ 0 ), where Φ 0 is a Lipschitz function from the k resolved modes to the complement.</p><p>Properties of the AIM:</p><p>• For k large enough, depending on the physical parameters, one can show that, even though the global attractor is not contained in the AIM M 0 it is contained in a thin layer of thickness of the order O(k -β ), for some β &gt; 0, about M 0 . • For every initial data inside the absorbing ball the corresponding solution of the dissipative evolution equation converges exponentially fast to the above mentioned thin layer about the graph of the AIM M 0 , with a rate of the order O(k γ ), for some γ &gt; 0.</p><p>Summary: All solutions outside the absorbing ball converge exponentially fast to the absorbing ball at a rate that depends on the physical parameters. All solutions starting inside the absorbing ball converge to a thin layer about the AIM M 0 , whose thickness is of the order O(k -β ), for some β &gt; 0 (k is the dimension of M 0 ). Furthermore the convergence is exponentially fast with rate of the order O(k γ ), for some γ &gt; 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Diffusion Maps</head><p>The Diffusion Maps algorithm reveals the intrinsic geometry of a data set X = {x i } N i=1 , where each data point x i ∈ R m , by constructing a random walk on X. This random walk is constructed by means of an affinity matrix A with entries computed in terms of a kernel</p><p>where ε is a positive hyperparameter that specifies the rate of decay of the kernel (kernel bandwidth). The Gaussian kernel, Equation (25), is typically chosen for the construction of the affinity matrix A.</p><p>To obtain a random walk (parametrization) of X regardless of the sampling density the normalization</p><p>is applied, with α = 1 to factor out the density effects.</p><p>A second normalization,</p><p>is applied to recover the row-stochastic matrix K. The eigendecomposition of K,</p><p>gives a set of eigenvectors ϕ and eigenvalues λ. Proper selection of the eigenvectors that parameterize independent directions, (known as non-harmonics) is needed. This selection in practice can be achieved by using the local linear regression algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dsilva et al. [2018]</ref>. If the number of non-harmonic eigenvectors is smaller than the original dimension ñ &lt; n then those eigenvectors Φ = {ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ ñ} can provide a more parsimonious representation of the original data and thus to obtain dimensionality reduction.</p><p>It is therefore important to discover which eigenvectors parametrize independent directions, and do not span the same direction with different frequencies (harmonics).</p><p>To achieve this, the local linear regression algorithm, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dsilva et al. [2018]</ref> is used, according to which, each DMAP coordinate is fitted as a function of the previous ones. To select the DMAP coordinates that are independent, the "goodness of fit" of this functions is used: A good fit is associated with a ϕ k that is a harmonic function of the previous eigenmodes, whereas a bad fit signifies that ϕ k is a new independent direction on the data manifold.</p></div>			</div>
