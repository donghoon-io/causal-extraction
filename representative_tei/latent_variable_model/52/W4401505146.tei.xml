<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research study aimed to evaluate the impact of transportation, specifically public transit, perceived built environment, and sociodemographic indicators on community quality of life (QoL) and individual's overall life satisfaction (OLS) at the national level in the United States. The study used survey data collected at the national level in the United States in 2017 called the National Community Livability Survey (NCLS). The surveys were sent out to 25,000 adults across 50 U.S. states, with 994 completed responses received. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was employed to investigate the effects of three latent factors, i.e., perceived built environment, quality of transportation, and support for transit funding on community QoL and individual OLS.</p><p>Along with latent factors, observed variables included in the analysis were perceived public transit importance, public transit need, ease of travel, and sociodemographic indicators. The perceived built environment and quality of transportation have a significant positive impact on community QoL but an insignificant impact on an individual's OLS. Support for transit funding was found to have an insignificant effect on community QoL but a significant positive impact on individual OLS. Perceived public transit importance has a significant negative impact on community QoL, while public transit needs have a significant negative effect on an individual's OLS. Ease of travel was the only variable with a significant positive impact on both community QoL and individual OLS. Sociodemographic indicators such as age, income, health, education, and race significantly affect an individual's satisfaction with life. Improvement in the perceived built environment, quality of transportation, specifically public transit and active transportation, and providing easily accessible travel options may improve the QoL of people.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Quality of Life (QoL) has been recognized as a multidimensional construct comprised of objective life indicators <ref type="bibr">(health, education, etc.)</ref> and qualitative subjective measures of life (feeling positive or negative, and happiness, etc.). The factors that can impact QoL range from a personal level, such as income, age, health, etc., to a more broad societal level, such as culture, safety, environment, and physical infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson, 2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delbosc, 2012)</ref>. World Health Organization (WHO) defined QoL in the broadest of its context and identified six domains of QoL.</p><p>They are: 1) physical health, 2) psychological health, 3) social relationships, 4) level of independence, 5) environment, and 6) personal beliefs <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 1997</ref>). Among the six domains, the environment is comprised of the home environment, transportation, social care and health, satisfaction with work, the physical environment, and options for recreation/entertainment activities participation. Within the transportation sector, <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sener, 2016</ref>) identified four QoL dimensions <ref type="bibr">(i.e., physical, social, mental, and economic)</ref> that are influenced by the built environment, mobility/accessibility, and vehicular traffic. The authors conducted content analysis of the 148 long-range transportation plans in the U.S. to assess the extent to which QoL is being considered in the transportation planning process. It was concluded that metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are inconsistently addressing QoL measures in their transportation plans. The authors recommended that QoL dimensions need to be included in future transportation planning processes.</p><p>To include QoL impacts in the transportation decision-making process, transportation planners and policymakers should first identify the relationship between the transportation system and QoL.</p><p>Such an understanding of the relationship between transportation and QoL can assist with better planning of communities by considering various dimensions of QoL; this strategy will simultaneously reduce the burdens related to urban congestion and also improve overall QoL <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sener, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The availability of good public transit service plays a key role in improving the QoL of people, especially for public transit-dependent populations that include elderly people, people with disability, individuals who cannot drive, and individuals with no private vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Godavarthy &amp; Mattson, 2016)</ref>. Similarly, neighborhoods with better walkability conditions can improve the physical health conditions of people through greater fitness, which in turn improves the QoL of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Frank, et al., 2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delbosc, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delbosc, 2012</ref>) presented a conceptual model comprehensively linking transportation to QoL or well-being. The authors considered three major components of the transportation system that can significantly influence well-being: 1) accessibility to important life activities, 2) physical mobility in terms of freedom to travel and availability of active transportation options, and 3) physical infrastructure of the transportation system. The results from a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kwon, Pickett, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2019)</ref> indicated that perceived walkability in terms of access to services and neighborhood attractiveness improves people's QoL.</p><p>Improved QoL should be the ultimate social goal in transportation policy instead of improved accessibility or mobility. Without considering 'improved QoL' as a final goal, the transportation social policy may just end up encouraging enhanced accessibility or mobility for the sake of it, and without combining these policies with specific QoL objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Stanley &amp; Stanley, 2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Stanley &amp; Vella-Brodrick, 2009)</ref>. QoL is complex and can be influenced by several factors related to transportation, e.g., quality of public transit services, traffic safety, walkability in the community, and quality of road conditions, etc. Built environment components (e.g., availability of quality public schools, health care services, parks, and recreation facilities, etc.) also play a critical role in improving the QoL of people. Similarly, personal characteristics, such as age, income, physical disability, etc., can impact the QoL of individuals irrespective of the facilities available. So, considering these factors within a single study can provide a more accurate and comprehensive measure of QoL. This study attempted to empirically evaluate the effects of transportation (specifically public transit and active transportation modes, quality of transportation), perceived built environment, including accessibility to important life amenities, and sociodemographic indicators on community QoL personal OLS within a single framework at the national level in the United States. The remaining paper is organized as follows: Literature Review section defines QoL from a broader perspective, followed by transportation and built environment impact on QoL. Data and structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology is presented in Methods section followed by the Results and Discussion section and in the end Conclusions section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of Life Broad Definition</head><p>Early QOL definitions fall under four general categories: Objective, subjective, combination of objective/subjective, and domain-specific <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sener, 2016)</ref>. Objective-level QoL indicators include crime rate, household income, divorce rate, etc. These objective indicators were appropriate for community/societal level QoL assessment but, failed to apprehend individual level life perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Farquhar, 1995)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Felce &amp; Perry, 1995)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sirgy, et al., 2006)</ref>. The subjective component comprises positive and negative feelings, and overall life satisfaction has been acknowledged and validated against objective indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Diener, 2000)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Oswald &amp; Wu, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>However, subjective indicators also insufficiently capture the state of one's QoL through measures of overall life satisfaction and being independent of objective indicators <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sener, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have agreed that QoL is comprised of both objective indicators of life and qualitative overall life satisfaction measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson, 2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ferkany, 2012)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sarch, 2012)</ref>. This recognition of considering QoL as a combination of both subjective and objective indicators provides a more comprehensive definition of QoL. It covers both objective goals of life (e.g., employment gains, health, and reduction in crime rate, etc.) and subjective life measures, such as overall life satisfaction and happiness, that may vary based on an individual's perceptions and circumstances.</p><p>The fourth and final class of definitions captures the impacts of QoL within specific disciplines or domains. Researchers from social sciences, health, and transportation have discovered relationships between QOL and housing, job-related impacts on QoL, the impact of health conditions on the QoL of an individual, and an increase in car pricing impact on QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kyle &amp; Dunn, 2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Drobnič, Beham, &amp; Präg, 2010)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bize, Johnson, &amp; Plotnikoff, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">) (de Groot &amp; Steg, 2006)</ref>. Researchers argued that domain-specific QoL measures/definitions can be more useful to experts in their respective disciplines. It will help researchers in more accurately identifying the possibilities about how specific domain-related variables interact with QoL <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sener, 2016)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transportation and Quality of Life</head><p>Three of the most significant factors that may affect QoL are health, meaningful social relationships, and poverty/unemployment. All these three factors can be affected directly by the availability of proper transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delbosc, 2012)</ref>. Transportation's impact on physical health has been investigated in numerous studies. For example, the availability and use of active transportation (bike and walkability) can reduce obesity rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Basset, Pucher, Buehler, Thompson, &amp; Crouter, 2008)</ref>, and an increase in public transit use has been shown to significantly improve the physical health conditions of its users <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sener, Lee, &amp; Elgart, 2016)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Reuda, Nazelle, Teixido, &amp; Nieuwenhuijsen, 2012)</ref>. Using a randomized sample from Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA), the authors found that 44% of bicyclists and 59% of car occupants reported problems in long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after road traffic crash injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ohlin, Berg, Lie, &amp; Alguren, 2017)</ref>. Studies also consider the social life impacts of transportation along with physical health. An efficient transportation system provides access to different recreation and social activities, which help people build social networks and improve their relationships. Although many of the socializing activities can be accomplished through online means nowadays, transportation provides greater life participation which in turn enhances QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Metz, 2003)</ref>. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hart &amp; Parkhurst, 2011)</ref> found that higher traffic volume on streets has a considerable negative influence on social life and the physical environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Velho, 2018)</ref> conducted a qualitative study to evaluate the accessibility of public transit to wheelchair users and its impact on their social life and health. The study describes the social and physical barriers that wheelchair users face in the public transit network and the negative emotions that these barriers incur on wheelchair users. Transportation policies that support finding and keeping employment are likely to enhance QoL. A lack of an efficient transportation system has been cited as a major obstacle to finding employment <ref type="bibr">(Social Exclusion Unit, 2003)</ref>. Also, the transportation system should provide less expensive transportation options such as public transit, bicycle, and walkability, etc. to reduce the burden on poor people and unemployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delbosc, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Early work in transportation-related QoL dimensions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Banister &amp; Bowling, 2004)</ref> evaluated the influence of mobility on the QoL of older people using categorical analysis in Britain.</p><p>The authors found that older people experiencing longstanding illness and their inability to walk 400-meter distances were associated with lower levels of QoL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(de Groot &amp; Steg, 2006</ref>) conducted a study to examine the impact of transportation pricing policy on potential car use and how it may affect the QoL of individuals. The study results revealed that, in general, a minor decrease in the QoL of respondents was expected by doubling the car use price. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Stanley, Hensher, Stanley, &amp; Vella-Brodrick, 2011)</ref> explored the relationship between individual travel patterns, social exclusion, and personal well-being in the Melbourne metropolitan area and at the regional level in Victoria. The study results revealed that increased trip-making (increased mobility) is significantly associated with reduced social exclusion risk at both metropolitan and regional levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bergstad, et al., 2011</ref>) evaluated the direct and indirect impact of satisfaction with daily travel on subjective well-being (SWB) in Sweden. The study results revealed that satisfaction with daily travel has both a direct impact on SWB and an indirect influence through the mediation of satisfaction with routine activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carse, 2011)</ref> presented a transport quality of life (TQoL) model that can be used to appraise TQoL on all public transportation modes in a city. The model was applied to the case studies of Glasgow and Manchester by considering light rail, train, and bus public transit modes.</p><p>The TQoL indicators validated in the study were access and availability, sustainable transportation, environment, transportation costs, and personal safety. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cao, 2013)</ref> examined the Light Rail Transit (LRT) impact on satisfaction with life in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul twin cities using public transit perception, accessibility perception, and satisfaction with travel as latent variables.</p><p>It was concluded that LRT in the twin cities has a significant positive impact on the resident's satisfaction with life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kolodinsky, et al., 2013)</ref> evaluated the impact of the amount of travel (number of trips) and unserved travel demand on QoL in rural New England. The study results revealed that it is not the increased trip-making that impacts QoL but the ability of the people to travel to reach their desired destinations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Zhu, Li, Chen, Liu, &amp; Zeng, 2019)</ref> investigated the effect of commuting mode and time on SWB in China. The study results indicate that the shorter the commute time, the higher the SWB. The results also revealed that the SWB of residents who use active transportation (cycling or walking) as their commuting mode was significantly lower. The results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sun, Lin, &amp; Yin, 2021)</ref> study also revealed that prolonged commute duration and people who use public transport as a commute mode have lower SWB. Commuting to work or school by using active transportation (cycling/walking) has been positively associated with worklife balance and subjective well-being, especially among women in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Herman &amp; Larouche, 2021)</ref>. Transportation impact on QoL was examined by developing three separate ordered probit models. The authors considered ease of travel in a community, community QoL, and individual's overall life satisfaction, respectively, as dependent variables. Instead of using three separate models, the authors recommended using a systems approach in future studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mattson, et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Tran, et al., 2023)</ref> conducted a study in Japan to investigate the indirect impact of mode use on SWB considering out-of-home activities. The authors considered the affective and cognitive components of SWB dimensions. The results showed that the use of public transport mode improved the cognitive component while it negatively influenced the affective component of SWB. The effect of active transportation as a travel mode was not clear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Built Environment and Quality of Life</head><p>The effect of the built environment on the QoL has also been investigated in past research. A study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sarmiento, et al., 2010)</ref> found that built environment characteristics such as heterogeneity in land use and park density were positively associated with the HRQOL, while the availability of public transit stations was negatively associated with HRQOL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao, Ahern, &amp; Koshland, 2016)</ref> investigated the relationship between HRQOL and built environment perception in Xian, China neighborhoods. Ease of access was associated significantly with both higher physical and mental well-being for all neighborhoods. Safety, increased diversity, and esthetics attributes of the built environment were associated significantly with higher psychological and physical well-being in the new neighborhoods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mouratidis, 2018)</ref> investigated the relationships between social well-being and the built environment in the context of urban form using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that proximity to the city center, mixed land uses, and higher population densities were positively associated with overall social well-being. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Huang, Chu, Kung, &amp; Hu, 2019)</ref> investigated the relationship between the built environment and HRQOL for older adults in Taiwan. The results showed a significant positive relationship between historical and cultural facilities and HRQOL. The relationship of HRQOL was also found with older adults' engagement in physical and social activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mouratidis, 2021)</ref> identified travel, work, health, leisure, social relationships, emotional responses, and residential well-being as seven potential pathways linking the built environment to SWB. Based on the evidence from the review knowledge, the author proposed certain strategies to improve SWB through urban planning. Some of these strategies include improved active travel conditions, car restrictions, enhanced public transport services, ease of access to services and facilities, social equity regarding support for transport and housing, developing emerging mobility and technology options to improve QoL and inclusiveness for different social groups, etc. The results from a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lee, Choi, &amp; Yoon, 2023)</ref> revealed that easy access to urban amenities, e.g., medical facilities, parks, sports facilities, shopping facilities, and schools, are associated significantly with higher satisfaction levels of residents with the urban environment.</p><p>Previous research explicitly evaluated the impact of separate transportation components on QoL (transportation pricing, satisfaction with travel, number of trips, travel demand, etc.).</p><p>Similarly, studies also investigated the relationships between built environment components and well-being. Considering different domains of transportation and perceived built environment in an integrated framework will provide a more accurate measure of people's QoL and is missing in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delbosc, 2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(Lee &amp; Sener, 2016)</ref> studies provide conceptual frameworks in this regard but the empirical study is missing. This study fills this gap by empirically investigating the impact of different aspects of transportation and the perceived built environment, along with sociodemographic characteristics, on community and individual well-being within a single framework. Second, by using nationwide survey data, this study, for the first time, offers a comprehensive understanding of the effects of factors related to transportation and perceived built environment on QoL across the communities in the United States.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source, Study Area, and Sample</head><p>This study used data collected through a national survey called the National Community Livability Survey (NCLS). The survey was conducted from April to December in the year 2017 by the Texas</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A&amp;M Transportation Institute and North Dakota State University's Upper Great Plains</head><p>Transportation Institute (UGPTI). The survey was conducted as a part of a research project that was aimed to analyze the livability of a community and evaluating the role of public transit on QoL and OLS of individuals in metro and non-metro areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Godavarthy, et al., 2018)</ref>. A stratified random sampling method was used to distribute the survey to ensure that survey distribution was proportional to the U.S. adult non-institutionalized population. The survey was stratified based on four U.S. regions and nine Census Divisions by age and sex to ensure adequate adult participation from each major geographic area of the U.S. Further, the survey was stratified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Economic Research Service (ERS) Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC), so surveys were distributed to individuals living in all nine RUCC classifications.</p><p>The NCLS study considered RUCC codes 1, 2, and 3 as metro areas, and RUCC codes 4-9 as nonmetro areas. It should be noted that a roughly equal number of surveys were distributed in each of the nine RUCC classifications, which meant that rural communities were over-sampled to ensure a comparable size of returned survey responses for each RUCC code. The surveys for the NCLS study were sent out to 25,000 adults from 50 U.S. states.</p><p>The response rate for the survey was 4%, which counts for a total of 994 completed responses received. The survey collected information from respondents about community livability (general and local), transportation, public transit, walkability, community QoL, individual OLS, future transportation and technology, and sociodemographic characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables Used in the Study</head><p>This section includes the variables from the survey that are used for the analysis in this study (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The variables that define perceived built environment characteristics from the survey sample included available jobs, cultural institutions, quality health care, quality public schools, the overall cost of living, shopping and entertainment options, parks and recreational facilities, public transit access to non-work amenities, and walking access to non-work amenities. The respondents were asked to rate the quality of five aspects of transportation in a community: public transit services, bikeability, walkability, condition of roads, and traffic safety. The quality of these indicators was measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents very poor, 2 represents poor, 3 represents acceptable, 4 represents good, and 5 represents very good. Support for transit funding was another variable used in this study. Respondents were asked about their support for transit funding from federal, state, city, and county-level sources. The variable "I support using (city, county, state and federal) funds for transit" was measured on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p><p>Perceived public transit importance and public transit support/need for a community are also included in this study to examine their impact on QoL. Respondents were asked about their perceived importance of public transit for their community on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 (strongly disagree that transit is important) to 5 (strongly agree). Ease of travel (mobility indicator) was another variable used in this study. In the survey, respondents were asked about how easily they can travel to places they need to go using their current travel options. Ease of travel is measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree that it is easy to make trips) to 5 (strongly agree). The sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents considered in this study are gender, age, race, level of education, annual household income, and overall health condition (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The two dependent variables used in this study are community QoL and individual OLS.</p><p>To assess the subjective QoL for community residents, respondents were asked about "How satisfied are you with the quality of life in your community" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kahneman &amp; Krueger, 2006)</ref>. The satisfaction of the QoL was measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). The average values estimated for metro and non-metro areas were 4.0 and 3.8, respectively; these results indicate that respondents were satisfied with QoL in their communities. The respondent's OLS was evaluated by asking the following question: "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?'. The response to this question was measured on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 considered as completely dissatisfied and 10 as completely satisfied. The average response scores estimated were 7.79 and 7.65 for metro and non-metro areas, respectively indicating more people are satisfied with their life at an individual level. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Model (SEM)</head><p>SEM is a multivariate analysis technique that allows the modeling phenomenon in which relationships between observed indicators, and unobserved (latent) variables are established.</p><p>Structural equation models are comprised of two components. They are: 1) a measurement model that assesses the relationship between latent variables and observed variables, and 2) a structural model or latent variable model that evaluates the strengths and direction of the relationship between latent exogenous and endogenous variables. The basic equation to describe the structural or latent variable model is as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝜂 = 𝐵𝜂 + Γ𝜉 + ζ (1)</formula><p>Where η (eta) is a m × 1 vector of latent endogenous variables, ξ (Xi) represents n × 1 vector of exogenous latent variables, ζ (zeta) is m ×1 vector of random variables, B (beta) represents m × m coefficient matrix for endogenous latent variables and Γ (gamma) is a m × n coefficient matrix for the exogenous latent variables.</p><p>The basic equations to describe the measurement model are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑥 = 𝛬 𝑥 𝜉 + 𝛿 (2) 𝑦 = 𝛬 𝑦 𝜂 + 𝜀<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Where x and y are the column q-vectors and column p-vectors related to the observed exogenous and observed endogenous variables, respectively; δ (delta) and ε (epsilon) are the errors related to observed exogenous and observed endogenous variables respectively; Λx (lambda) and</p><p>Λy represents q × n and p × m structural coefficient matrices for the effects of the latent exogenous, and latent endogenous variables on the observed ones respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM Hypothesized in this Study</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the conceptual SEM hypothesized for this study. The variables in the square box represent observed or manifest variables, and the variables in a circle represent latent variables.</p><p>The three latent independent variables in this study (shown in circle) are perceived built environment, quality of transportation, and support for transit funding. The respective observed variables related to the three latent factors/variables are explained in section 3.2. In the model, the final dependent variable is the individual's OLS, which is an observed endogenous variable.</p><p>There is one mediating dependent variable, i.e., community QoL, and it is also an observed endogenous variable. There are also three observed exogenous variables identified for the proposed SEM, and they are ease of travel (mobility indicator), perceived public transit importance for a community, and public transit need/support for the community. The impact of these exogenous variables is evaluated directly on an individual's life satisfaction and indirectly through the mediating community QoL variable. Research has shown that the type of area in which people are living has a significant influence on QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Schneider, Guo, &amp; Schroeder, 2013)</ref>. This research will also evaluate the impact of area type (metro vs non-metro) on community QoL and individual OLS as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The other set of observed exogenous variables are sociodemographic variables, also called controlled variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Najaf, Thill, Zhang, &amp; Fields, 2018)</ref>. The sociodemographic variables included in this study are age, gender, employment, level of education, physical disability, health, income, and race.</p><p>Through the development of SEM, the research will be able to evaluate the direct impact of the perceived built environment, quality of transportation, support for transit funding, ease of travel, public transit needs for a community, and perceived public transit importance on an individual's OLS and indirectly through the mediating community QoL variable. The research will also evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic variables and an individual's OLS. The model fit indices refer to standard parameters that help recognize how best the developed model represents the observed data. Before describing the SEM results, it is important to discuss the fit indices for the model finalized in this study. In SEM, the most important and commonly used fit indices are chi-square (χ 2 or CMIN), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and comparative fit index (CFI). These fit indices are considered ideal because they are easy to interpret, independent of sample size, and are accurate and flexible in the evaluation of the complexity of models <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Marsh, Balla, &amp; Mcdonald, 1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hooper et al, (2008)</ref> distinguished the fit indices for SEM into three categories: 1) absolute, 2) parsimony, and 3) incremental <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the fit indices for the SEM developed in this study. The χ 2 is an absolute measure of the fit index indicating the extent to which the estimated model relates to the variances and covariances in the observed sample data. A χ 2 difference test is mostly used as a test measurement for invariance across groups. A significant value indicates a poor model fit. The χ 2 is more sensitive to sample size compared to SRMR, RMSEA, and CFI, and always turns out be significant for large sample sizes and hence rejects the model fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980)</ref>. As an alternative, researchers recommended using the χ2-ratio, which is measured by dividing the χ2 value by degrees of freedom (DF) (χ2/DF) and is less dependent upon sample size. The χ 2 -ratios in the range of 2 to 5 are considered reasonable for model fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998)</ref>. The chi-square ratio for the model developed in this study is 3.91 (shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) which lies within the threshold range of adequate model fitness.</p><p>SRMR measures the standardized difference between observed and predicted correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>. A model with SRMR value less than 0.08 is considered a good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 2009)</ref>. RMSEA measures the difference between degrees of freedom anticipated to occur in the population. Acceptable values of RMSEA range between 0.05 and 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Medsker, Williams, &amp; Holahan, 1994)</ref>. For the SEM developed in this study, both SRMR and RMSEA index values are within the acceptable model fit index range (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The CFI index ranges from 0 to 1, and a value greater than 0.90 is considered good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Medsker, Williams, &amp; Holahan, 1994)</ref>. The index value for CFI is a little bit lower (0.88) than the threshold value of 0.90. These model fit indices (shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) indicate that the SEM developed in this study has an overall good model fit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model or Confirmatory Factor Analysis Results</head><p>Measurement model or confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) investigates the relationship between manifest/observed variables and latent factors. CFA aims to confirm the structural validity of the proposed latent factors that are hypothesized based on theoretical knowledge. Three latent factors were considered in this study: 1) perceived built environment, 2) quality of transportation, and 3) support for transit funding. After accounting for the missing values, the remaining sample size used for SEM was 742 out of 994 total observations in the survey (n=742). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the relationship between observed variables and latent factors participating in the CFA.</p><p>The structures of these latent factors are finalized through the CFA process. The results from CFA revealed that all the manifest variables hypothesized for the proposed latent factors formation were statistically significant at a significance level (p-value) less than 0.01. Most of the standardized regression coefficients are reasonably high with a value greater than 0.5. The three latent factors validated through CFA are described below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived built environment</head><p>The perceived built environment latent factor is formed from nine observed variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Most of the observed variables have reasonably high standardized regression coefficient values</head><p>with a value greater than 0.5, except for "overall cost of living" (0.43), "walk access to non-work amenities" (0.27), and "public transit access to non-work amenities" (0.20). The public transit and walking access to non-work amenities were considered in the built environment latent construct because accessibility to services and facilities is considered one of the most influencing factors that affect QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao, Ahern, &amp; Koshland, 2016</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mouratidis, 2021)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Iamtrakul, Chayphong, &amp; Yoshitsugu, 2024)</ref>. The top three observed variables that best explain the perceived built environment latent factor identified were "shopping and entertainment options" (0.76), "quality health care services" (0.68), and "available jobs" (0.68). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of transportation</head><p>The quality of transportation latent factor is formed from five observed variables and these variables are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The quality of transportation latent factor was best understood by "quality of bikeability" (0.74), "quality of walkability" (0.72) and "quality of public transit services" (0.57), while "quality of road conditions" (0.46) and "traffic safety" (0.45) also have minor effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support for transit funding</head><p>The support for transit funding latent factor was comprised of four observed variables in which respondents were asked about their support for transit funding using city, county, state, and federal funds (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The CFA results revealed that all four sources of funding have a major effect on support for transit funding latent factor with standardized regression coefficient values greater than 0.75.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model Results and Discussion</head><p>The structural model component of the SEM investigates the direction and strengths of the relationships between latent exogenous and endogenous variables. This study evaluated the direct effects of latent exogenous variables (perceived built environment, quality of transportation, and support for transit funding) on community QoL and individual OLS. The study also investigates the direct effects of important observed exogenous variables (ease of travel, perceived transit importance, transit need/support, and area type) on both community QoL and individual OLS. The variable area type in the proposed SEM was measured on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents more urban areas, and 5 refers to rural areas. The variable was measured based on RUCC from 1 to 9. Some of the values of the RUCC were combined to obtain adequate distribution of sample sizes for each value of the area type variable scaled from 1 to 5. The indirect effects of these latent and observed exogenous variables have also been estimated through mediating community QoL variable. The model also considers the effects of respondent's sociodemographic characteristics on an individual's OLS.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the statistical results of the structural model developed for this study.</p><p>Perceived built environment latent factor has the highest direct effect (Std. R.W. = 0.517) on community QoL and is also significant at less than 1% significance level (p-value &lt; 0.0001), while it has an insignificant direct effect on an individual's OLS. The quality of transportation latent factor has a moderate effect on community QOL (Std. R.W. = 0.132), significant at the 5% significance level (p-value = 0.028), while this latent factor has an insignificant direct effect on an individual's OLS. The third latent factor, "support for transit funding," has a statistically insignificant effect on community QoL, while it has a significant (p-value = 0.011) and moderate direct effect on individual OLS (Std. R.W. = 0.118). These findings are intuitive as the perceived built environment and quality of transportation represent broad societal indicators and hence have a significant direct impact on community QoL. Support for transit funding latent factor represents an individual's perception of supporting public transit funding from external sources (city, county, state, or federal). It has a significant direct effect on an individual's OLS dependent variable.</p><p>Moreover, within the perceived built environment, indicators such as shopping and entertainment options, quality health care services, available jobs, and parks and recreation facilities were identified with the highest effects on improving the built environment (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Policymakers should put more emphasis on enhancing these attributes of the built environment. Similarly, the top three indicators with the highest effects on the quality of transportation identified were the quality of walkability, bikeability, and public transit services (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Improving the quality of these three modes of transportation will significantly improve the community's QoL. The government and transportation agencies should invest more in improving these three aspects of transportation. In the case of transit funding, the city, county, state, and federal governments should provide the funding needed to public transit agencies to provide optimal service for public transit users and hence improve their satisfaction with life. Ease of travel is the only observed exogenous variable that has a significant direct effect on both community QoL and individual OLS. The effect is higher on an individual's OLS (Std. R.W. = 0.168), while the impact on community QoL is minor (Std. R.W. = 0.085). Providing efficient and more easily accessible travel options that can fulfill daily travel needs will improve the QoL of residents at both community and individual levels. Perceived public transit importance has a significant negative effect (Std. R.W. = -0.097) on community QoL. This finding can be interpreted in a way that people who recognize public transit as more important for their daily lives have lower community QoL. Most probably, these include transit-dependent populations such as lower-income people, people who cannot drive, people with disabilities, and individuals without their own vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Godavarthy &amp; Mattson, 2016)</ref>. Providing efficient public transit services might improve their QoL. Public transit need/support has a significant negative impact (Std. R.W. = -0.125) on the individual's OLS and an insignificant impact on community QoL. The negative impact of public transit needs on individual OLS can be interpreted in a way that people who supported more public transit services in their community might feel a deficiency in existing public transit services to fulfil their daily travel needs and hence are experiencing lower OLS. The other reason might be that people with greater public transit needs/support are also more likely to be low-income, in poor health conditions, unable to drive, etc.</p><p>The impact of people living in urban vs rural areas in the form of geographic variable (area type) on community QoL and individual OLS was also investigated. This variable has a significant positive effect on community QoL. In other words, people living in rural areas have better community QoL than those living in more urban areas, but the estimated effect was marginal. The impact of community QoL on an individual's OLS as a mediating variable is also significant and high (Std. R.W. = 0.297). Clearly, a better community QoL will also enhance the OLS of individuals living in their respective communities. The other set of variables included in the model were sociodemographic variables. The impact of these sociodemographic variables on an individual's OLS was also investigated in the model.</p><p>Age, income, and health have a significant positive impact on an individual's OLS. These findings indicate that older people, people with higher incomes, and individuals with better health conditions are more satisfied with their lives than their counterparts. Level of education and race/ethnicity have significant negative impacts on an individual's OLS, which indicates that individuals with a higher level of education and non-white populations have lower OLS. The association of a higher level of education with lower life satisfaction might be due to their higher goals and aspirations in life that sometimes could be difficult to achieve.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect and Total Effects on Individual's OLS</head><p>SEM can measure both direct and indirect effects through mediating variables. The mediator for individual's OLS in this study is community QoL. Three conditions need to be satisfied for mediation to be incorporated and they are: 1) the independent variable should be significantly related to a mediating variable, 2) the mediating variable should be significantly related to the final dependent variable, and 3) the relationship of the independent variable to final dependent variable should diminish after incorporating mediating variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>. Along with these three conditions, the mediating variable should theoretically make sense. All these conditions were satisfied for the hypothesized mediating variable i.e., community QoL.</p><p>Moreover, if all the paths between the independent and final dependent variables are significant, the indirect effect is assumed to be statistically significant. The indirect impact is estimated by the product of "α" and "ꞵ" parameters (α×ꞵ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008)</ref>. Where "α"</p><p>represents the unstandardized regression weight estimated between the independent and mediating variables, and "ꞵ" is the unstandardized regression weight estimated for the relationship between the mediating and final dependent variable. The total effect is the summation of the direct and indirect effects. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the direct, indirect, and total effects on an individual's OLS. The first column shows the variables that were tested for indirect effects through mediating community QOL variable in the hypothesized model. The perceived built environment and quality of transportation latent factors have moderate and minor indirect effects on an individual's OLS.</p><p>These variables do not directly affect an individual's OLS, so the total effect is the same as the indirect effect. Support for transit funding latent factor does not have a statistically significant indirect effect through community QOL mediating variable. The ease of travel observed variable has both direct and indirect effects on an individual's OLS, with the highest total effect of 0.193.</p><p>Perceived public transit importance and area type have marginal indirect effects of -0.029 and 0.022, respectively. Public transit needs do not have a statistically significant indirect effect on an individual's OLS. By considering total effects, ease of travel, perceived built environment, and support for transit funding have high positive effects on an individual's OLS. This indicates that improving the built environment, providing affordable and efficient travel options to enhance ease of travel in communities, and providing more funding to public transit services from external sources will improve individual OLS. Public transit need/support for a community has a high negative total effect on an individual's OLS. This finding can be interpreted as people who perceived that their community needed more public transit services are experiencing lower OLS at the individual level. Providing more public transit services in their respective communities might improve their satisfaction with life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>By using the advanced technique of SEM, this study evaluates the impact of different aspects of transportation, along with the perceived built environment and sociodemographic characteristics, on community QoL and individual OLS. The study results revealed that improvement in the perceived built environment has the highest direct effect on enhancing community QoL. The study results indicated that improvement in non-motorized transportation (walking and biking) and public transit could improve QoL at a community level. It can be concluded that providing safe, efficient, and easily accessible travel options that can fulfill individuals' daily travel needs will improve the residents' QoL both at the community and individual levels. The other major finding of this study is that QoL for transit-dependent populations (lower-income people, people who cannot drive, and people with disabilities, etc.) can be improved by providing more efficient public transit systems.</p><p>The results in this study were based on aggregate national-level survey data and may not necessarily be applicable to the local communities. Some populations in the survey were over-or -under-represented, e.g., minorities, younger people, and the less educated were under-represented. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Hypothesized Conceptual SEM</figDesc></figure>
