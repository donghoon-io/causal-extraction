An archetype situation provides a two-state dissipative quantum dynamics, commonly known under the label of a spin-boson dynamics. An interesting and nontrivial physical situation emerges, however, when the quantum dynamics evolves far away from thermal equilibrium. This occurs, for example, when a charge transferring medium possesses nonequilibrium degrees of freedom, or when a strong time-dependent control field is applied externally. Accordingly, certain parameters of underlying quantum subsystem acquire stochastic character. This may occur for example for the tunnelling coupling between the donor and acceptor states of transferring electron, or for the corresponding energy difference between electronic states which assume via the coupling to the fluctuating environment an explicit stochastic or deterministic time-dependence. Herein, we review the general theoretical framework which is based on the method of projector operators, yielding the quantum master equations for systems that are exposed to strong external fields. This allows one to investigate on a common basis the influence of nonequilibrium fluctuations and periodic electrical fields on those already mentioned dynamics and related quantum transport processes. Most importantly, such strong fluctuating fields induce a whole variety of nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena. A characteristic feature of such dynamics is the absence of thermal (quantum) detailed balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The description and analysis of the dynamics of open quantum systems, i.e. quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment, presents a key challenge for nonequilibrium statistical physics. Moreover, this theme is also of prominent importance for many applications in physics, physical chemistry and physical biology. This can be exemplified by the relaxation dynamics occurring in a two-level quantum system that is coupled to the vibrational degrees of freedom of an environment. This latter theme gained great popularity and is known under the label of "spin-boson dynamics" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Several apparently different physical problems can formally be unified within such a common mathematical description. For example, the relaxation dynamics of a nuclear spin 1/2 in solids, the tunnelling of defects in metals, the relaxation dynamics of atoms in optical cavities can all be modelled by a (pseudo)-spin-boson dynamics. Another important and relevant situation refers to donor-acceptor electron transfer reactions in various molecular structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. For spatially extended quasi-periodic molecular structures like those formed by protein α-helices <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, or DNA's <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> many quantum states are generally required to describe charge transfer processes. Here, a multi-state tunnelling problem naturally emerges with the tight-binding model serving as one of simplest theoretical frameworks.</p><p>The primary problem is to describe the influence of the environmental degrees of freedom on the quantum dynamics of interest. Many different approaches have been developed to tackle this challenge. The fundamental methodology consists in separating the total system into the two (or more) mutually interacting parts: the dynamical subsystem with a small number of relevant degrees of freedom and a thermal bath represented by a huge number of microscopic degrees of freedom which are at thermal equilibrium. A most general quantum-mechanical description is provided by the density operator of the whole, combined system which depends both on the variables of the considered dynamical subsystem (relevant variables) and the variables of the thermal bath (irrelevant variables). The dynamical behaviour of a small quantum subsystem presents the focus of interest with the thermally equilibrated bath degrees of freedom serving as a source of randomness for the relevant dynamics. This randomness can effectively be eliminated via a course-grained description of the system of interest. A corresponding averaging procedure results in a contracted, reduced dynamics which generally entails memory effects, decoherence and dissipation.</p><p>Different approaches have been developed over the years within this general line of reasoning. Within a variety of different approaches, the method of path integrals in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> and the projection operator method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref> provide some of the most frequently used methods. The path-integral approach can, however, be technically cumbersome in practical applications of interest. The projection operator method appeals to its generality and technical elegance. It allows one to obtain formally exact generalised master equations (GMEs) for the reduced density matrix in a straightforward way. By and large, however, such exact GMEs cannot be analytically elaborated further without invoking some sort of a perturbation technique with corresponding approximations. For example, already the seemingly simple spinboson dynamics cannot be solved analytically exactly. The weak-coupling approximation of the system-bath coupling is one of the most useful and commonly employed scheme. Moreover, a strong-coupling problem can often be mapped onto a (different) weak-coupling problem within a canonically transformed basis of the total system. The projection operator method, combined with appropriate canonical transformations, further improved by use of variational approaches, presents a powerful and general method of wide acceptance. This well-established methodology is, however, also rather demanding.</p><p>Yet another popular methodology consists in modelling the thermal bath influence through a classical stochastic field which acts upon the considered dynamical system. Formally, this methodology corresponds to introduction of randomly fluctuating time-dependent forces in the Hamiltonian of considered quantum system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref> and finding subsequently the stochastically averaged evolution of the considered system which is governed by a stochastic Liouville-von-Neumann equation. This methodology is known under the label of stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>. Due to a reasoning that involves the central limit theorem classical random forces with Gaussian statistics are most frequently used in this kind of approximate modelling. The Gaussian white noise serves here as a simplest implementation for the corresponding classical stochastic bath. It corresponds to a bath with an infinite spectrum of excitations. Such models can be solved exactly in a number of specific cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref>. All the thermal baths possess, however, finite energy spectra. This circumstance gives rise to temporal autocorrela-tions in the bath-induced classical stochastic fields. Gaussian Markov noise with the exponentially decaying temporal autocorrelations presents one of the simplest models of such more realistic, coloured noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref>. Yet, even in the simplest case of a two-state tunnelling system this model cannot be solved exactly except for some limiting cases (see, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref> for the Landau-Zener model with a stochastic modulation). Generically one must invoke some approximations; e.g., in the case of a weakly coloured Gaussian noise some kind of cumulant expansion technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">47</ref>] can be used.</p><p>There exists a different possibility. Continuous state noises can be approximated by noise sources with a large number of discrete states (e.g., by a discretisation procedure of a continuous diffusion process in a potential). Certain Markovian discrete state noises provide then a rather general framework for a formally exact stochastic averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">49]</ref>. Moreover, the two-state Markovian noise (also known as dichotomous noise) presents such a simple discrete noise source which allows for an exact study of noise driven twolevel quantum systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[56]</ref>. In addition, the multistate case of exciton transfer in molecular aggregates with many quasi-independent noise sources modelled by independent two-state Markovian noises presents another analytically tractable case, in the sense that it can be reduced to the solution of a system of linear differential equations with constant coefficients for averaged dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[57]</ref>. The discussed dichotomous noise can model a quasi-spin 1/2 stochastic bath variable. In the case of electron transfer in molecular systems such a quasi-spin stochastic variable can simulate, for example, the bistable fluctuations of a charged molecular group nearby the donor, or acceptor site, or the conformational fluctuations of a bistable molecular bridge.</p><p>A well-known drawback of the SLE approach consists, however, in the asymptotic equal-population of the energy levels of quantum system which occurs for arbitrary energy differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">41]</ref>. This means that the SLE approach corresponds formally to an infinite bath temperature. At least, the thermal energy k B T should thus be larger than the characteristic energy scale of the quantum system, e.g., larger than the energy width of the corresponding excitonic band. This corresponds to a high-temperature approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">57]</ref>. The reason for this intrinsic restriction is that the stochastic field unidirectionally drives the quantum system without being modified by the system's feedback (no back reaction). This drawback within the SLE approach requires some ad hoc corrections to enforce the correct thermal equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">61]</ref>. Nevertheless, the SLE approach can yield a very useful tool, notably in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">59]</ref>, the theory of exciton transfer in molecular aggregates <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref> and within the theory of single-molecular spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Combined scenarios have been used in several works <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[63]</ref>. Initially, those were aimed to model the influence of relaxation processes in the thermal bath <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[61]</ref>, or to account for non-Gaussian large-amplitude fluctuations of molecular charged groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[62]</ref>. However, it was soon recognised that the addition of classical noise to a dissipative quantum dynamics generally violates the detailed balance symmetry at the environmental temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[64]</ref>. Therefore, the stochastic field in these approaches correspond physically to a nonequilibrium noise influence. It has been shown theoretically that such a nonequilibrium non-Gaussian (e.g., two-state) noise can regulate the quantum transition rates by several orders of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[66]</ref>. Moreover, it may pump energy into the quantum system. This in turn gives rise to various interesting nonlinear nonequilibrium phenomena such as a noise-induced enhancement of thermally assisted quantum tunnelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67]</ref>, an inversion of population in discrete quantum dissipative systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[68]</ref>, a noise-induced absolute negative mobility for quantum transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[69]</ref>, or also a fluctuation-induced transport of quantum particles within a tight-binding description <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[70]</ref>, to name the most prominent ones. From a thermodynamical perspective these nonequilibrium effects are due to a virtual presence of two heat baths of different nature: a first one assuming the temperature of the environment T (modelled by a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators that are bi-linearly coupled to the relevant system), another one possessing a virtually infinite temperature T σ = ∞ (stochastic bath). In this intuitive picture, a nonequilibrium stochastic field is expected to heat the quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom, causing various, surprising nonequilibrium phenomena.</p><p>The study of the dynamics of such quantum dissipative systems which are driven far from thermal equilibrium by nonequilibrium fluctuations is the focus of present work. The situation here is similar in spirit to one in the recently emerged field of (classical) Brownian motors <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[76]</ref>, see, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[81]</ref> for surveys and further references.</p><p>In this review, we present a general outline with many important examples given of the following methodology: The nonequilibrium stochastic field is represented by an external time-varying classical field in the Hamiltonian of the quantum system. This field is treated without invoking any further approximation, until it becomes necessary to do so. In doing so, a formally exact generalised master equation is obtained which includes the external field both in the dynamical part and in the dissipative kernel of the GME exactly. Subsequently, the dissipative kernel is expanded to the lowest order, i.e. the second order in the system-bath coupling. [In a properly canonically transformed basis this scheme allows one to study the opposite limit of strong dissipation/weak tunnelling as well.] The overall procedure results in an approximate, generalised master equation for the reduced density matrix of the considered, relevant quantum system. We recall that within this methodology the external field is not only included exactly in the dynamical part, but it modifies as well the dissipative kernel in a very profound manner. In particular, the dissipative kernel becomes a retarded functional of the driving field. Thereby, the field influence on quantum dynamics is taken rigorously into account within the given order of the system-bath coupling. Such a corresponding modification of the dissipative kernel becomes crucial for strong driving fields.</p><p>This so tailored approach allows one to describe stochastic and timeperiodic fields on equal grounds. The influence of a time-periodic driving on the dissipative quantum dynamics has been investigated in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[87]</ref>. Other related work has been done at the same time and in parallel by several other research groups elaborating similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[90]</ref>, or different <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[93]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[94]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[96]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[97]</ref> approaches which reconcile within some approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">99]</ref>.</p><p>The difference between the stochastic fields and the periodic fields enters within our approach on the level of averaging of the corresponding field-driven generalised master equations. In this context, one must refer to some further approximations, which generally are based on the separation of time scales involving the external driving, the contracted quantum dynamics, and the decay of dissipative kernels in the generalised master equations. Remarkably, in the case of dichotomous fluctuations this averaging can be done exactly without further approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">101]</ref>. The spin-boson model driven by such dichotomous Markovian fluctuations presents one instance of general interest which has been studied in detail in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">101]</ref>. Two other important situations, where an exact averaging is feasible for a broad class of stochastic and periodic processes, are given by an infinitely extended tight-binding model. These are: (i) the case of coherent tunnelling in the absence of dissipation and (ii) the regime of incoherent tunnelling (strong dissipation) when the tunnelling is weak (high tunnelling barriers). Some explicit pertinent examples are discussed in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[104]</ref>.</p><p>This review is organised as follows, see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The study of a quantum dynamics subjected to non-Markovian stochastic fields that are modelled by discrete state processes of the renewal type is presented in Section 2. Therein, a formally exact averaging of the quantum evolution over the stationary realizations of stochastic fields is given. The general results are illustrated by a new Laplace-transformed exact solution of averaged two-level quantum dynamics driven by a symmetric non-Markovian two-state field. The prior results for a quantum two-level dynamics driven by a dichotomous Markovian field are reproduced as a particular limiting case. This section contains also the results for the fluctuating Kubo oscillator. These are used in the following. This section also contains a short primer into the projection operator  formalism. Two-state quantum dynamics in strong periodic fields is considered in Sec. 3. The Section 4 outlines the general formalism of dissipative quantum dynamics in strong, time-varying fields within the reduced density matrix approach. The corresponding weak-coupling generalised master equations and the generalised Redfield equations are presented there. These equations serve as a basis for subsequent applications and analysis of stochastic field-induced phenomena. Section 5 contains a simple implementation of our general approach which manifests the origin and basic features of strongly nonequilibrium phenomena described in the subsequent Sections for more realistic models. The stochastically and periodically driven spin-boson model is discussed in Section 6, including quantum stochastic resonance features. Section 7 is devoted to the phenomenon of noise-induced, absolute negative mobility in quantum transport and to the analysis of dissipative quantum rectifiers.

On the contrary, the RTD ψ j (τ ) and the time-independent p ij (with p ii := 0) can routinely be deduced from sample trajectories measured, say, in a singlemolecular experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[113]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> renders these assertions more obvious. The study of the statistics of the residence time-intervals allows one to obtain the corresponding probability densities ψ j (τ ) and, hence, the survival probabilities Φ j (τ ).

The averaging over the initial distribution alone is, however, not sufficient to arrive at the stationary noise-averaging in the case of non-Markovian processes since the noise realizations constructed in the way just described still remain non-stationary. This principal problem is rooted in the following observation. By preparing the quantum system at t 0 = 0 in a nonequilibrium state ρ(0), the noise will be picked up at random in some initial state ξ j 0 with the probability p st j 0 (stationary noise). However, every time when we repeat the preparation of the quantum system in its initial state, the noise will already occupy a (random) state ξ j 0 for some unknown, random time interval τ * j 0 (setting a clock at t 0 = 0 sets the initial time for the quantum system, but not for the noise, which is assumed to start in the infinite past, cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, where ξ j 0 = ξ 1 at t 0 = 0). Therefore, in a stationary setting a proper averaging over this unknown time τ * j is necessary. The corresponding procedure implies that the mean residence time τ j is finite, τ j = ∞, and yields a different residence time distribution for the initial noise state, ψ (0) j (τ ); namely, it is obtained as ψ (0) j (τ ) = Φ j (τ )/ τ j <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[115]</ref>. Only for Markovian processes where Φ j (τ ) is strictly exponential, does ψ (0) j (τ ) coincides with ψ j (τ ). Using this ψ (0) j (τ ) instead of ψ j (τ ) for the first sojourn in the corresponding state and for the time-independent set p ij , the noise realizations become stationary <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[114]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[115]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[116]</ref>.

In other words, the steady state populations of both energy levels equal 1/2, independently of the energy difference ǫ 0 . One can interpret this result in terms of a "temperature" T σ of the (quasi-)spin system. This spin-temperature is formally introduced by using for the asymptotic distribution an Ansatz of the Boltzmann-Gibbs form,</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ρ nn (∞) = exp[-E n /k B T σ ]/ n exp[-E n /k B T σ ]. Then, 5 T σ := ǫ 0 k B ln ρ 22 (∞) ρ 11 (∞)<label>(36)</label></formula><p>for two-level systems. In accord with this definition, the result of equal asymptotic populations, ρ 22 (∞) = ρ 11 (∞) = 1/2 can be interpreted in terms of an infinite temperature T σ = ∞. This constitutes a general finding: a purely stochastic bath corresponds to an apparent infinite temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">41]</ref>.

An asymmetry of unbiased stochastic perturbations does not change this conclusion, see in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[54]</ref>. Moreover, the relaxation to the steady state can be either coherent, or incoherent, depending on the noise strength and the autocorrelation time. In particular, an approximate analytical expression for the rate k of incoherent relaxation, ρ 11 (t) = [1 + exp(-kt)]/2, has been obtained in a limit of small Kubo numbers, K := ∆/ν ≪ 1, which corresponds to a weakly coloured noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">49]</ref>.

Moreover, the thermal detailed balance condition, p 2 (∞)W 21 (ǫ 0 ) = p 1 (∞)W 12 (ǫ 0 ) is obeyed always with the thermal bath temperature T .

This is in a sharp contrast to the stochastic bath modelling in Sec. 2.3.2, where we found that p 1 (∞) = p 2 (∞) and T σ = ∞. Furthermore, one can see that the thermal equilibrium at the bath temperature T becomes violated either by periodic, or by stochastic nonequilibrium fluctuations. This also implies that, generally, T σ = T . Put differently, either periodic, or stochastic (thermally nonequilibrium) fields drive the system out of the thermal equilibrium with the thermal bath.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Stochastic cooling and inversion of level populations</head><p>A second effect relates to the blockage of the rate for backward transitions W 21 (ǫ 0 ) ǫ relative to the forward rate W 12 (ǫ 0 ) ǫ . This can cause a stochastic cooling of the TLS, where the temperature T σ becomes smaller than the temperature of the environment, i.e., T σ &lt; T . This interesting phenomenon is demonstrated with Fig. <ref type="figure">4 (b)</ref>. Similar in spirit, although different in the physical mechanism is the laser cooling (of the nuclear degrees of freedom) as it has been studied both, theoretically and experimentally for polyatomic molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[149]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, for σ &gt; Ω 0 a noise-induced inversion of steady state averaged populations takes place, i.e., for a sufficiently small positive energy bias ǫ 0 the higher energy level becomes more populated. This constitutes the third very important effect under discussion, see Fig. <ref type="figure">4,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, where this pumping effect is interpreted in terms of a negative temperature T σ . In other words, the considered nonequilibrium noise of a sufficiently large amplitude is capable to pump quantum particles from the lower energy level to the higher one. This provides a possible archetype for quantum molecular pumps driven by nonequilibrium noise.</p><p>This inversion of population can be accompanied by cooling. Namely, the ensemble of TLSs becomes first effectively cooled and only then heated up (through, formally, T σ = ∞ to T σ = -∞) until the inversion of population occurs -cf. in Fig. <ref type="figure">4,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>. For this pumping mechanism to work, an inverted transport regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[184]</ref> is necessary; i.e., a regime where the static, unfluctuating forward rate becomes smaller with the increasing energy bias after reaching a maximum at ǫ max . In the present model, this maximum is located in the neighbourhood of Ω 0 . More precisely, ǫ max corresponds to the maximum in the difference between the forward and the backward rates, rather than to the maximum of the forward rate alone. The inversion happens for σ &gt; ǫ max and a sufficiently small energy bias ǫ 0 . A similar mechanism has been proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[68]</ref> within a spin-boson modelling of electron tunnelling in proteins, see below in Sec. 6, driven by nonequilibrium conformational fluctuations, e.g., utilising energy of ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>The underlying mechanism seems quite general. Indeed, the inversion of populations occurs whenever the difference of averaged rates ∆W (ǫ 0 ) ǫ := W 12 (ǫ 0 ) ǫ -W 21 (ǫ 0 ) ǫ becomes negative, ∆W (ǫ 0 ) ǫ &lt; 0, for a positive bias ǫ 0 &gt; 0. In the discussed limiting case, ∆W (ǫ 0 ) ǫ ≈ 1 2 [∆W (ǫ 0 +σ)+∆W (ǫ 0σ)] with ∆W (-ǫ) = -∆W (ǫ). Therefore, when σ exceeds ǫ max , where ∆W (ǫ) achieves a maximum and d dǫ ∆W (ǫ) &lt; 0 for σ &gt; ǫ max , the averaged difference of forward and backward rates becomes negative ∆W (ǫ 0 ) ǫ &lt; 0, for a positive energy bias ǫ 0 &gt; 0, i.e. an inversion of populations takes place.</p><p>In application to the quantum transport in a spatially extended system, a similar effect results in the noise-induced absolute negative mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[69]</ref>, see below in Sec. 7. The existence of the static current-voltage characteristics with a negative differential conductivity part is important for the latter phenomenon to occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Emergence of an effective energy bias</head><p>The fourth important effect, the onset of which can be seen already in the discussed archetype model, is rooted in a possible asymmetry of the unbiased on average fluctuations. Namely, let us consider the symmetric quantum system, ǫ 0 = 0, with asymmetric dichotomous fluctuations of the energy levels with zero mean, see in Sec. 2.3.1. Since in this case, the averaged propagator of the corresponding Kubo-oscillator is complex-valued, Im exp[i ζ(t, t ′ )] ǫ = 0, it can be readily seen from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_105">72</ref>) after invoking the decoupling approximation that w 12 (t, t ′ ) ǫ -w 21 (t, t ′ ) ǫ = 0 even if ǫ 0 = 0. This means that an effective asymmetry emerges. Moreover, the above difference is proportional also to Im K(t -t ′ ) = 0. If the autocorrelation function of the thermal bath, K(t), were real (like for a stochastic bath), then no asymmetry between the forward and backward rates could emerge in principle. Therefore, the discussed asymmetry does emerge due to a subtle interplay of the equilibrium quantum fluctuations of the thermal bath and nonequilibrium classical fluctuations of the energy levels, both of which are unbiased on average. Here is rooted the origin of quantum dissipative rectifiers put forward in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">102]</ref>.

Two limiting cases can be distinguished which can be classified by the Kubo number K W of the rate fluctuations, i.e. by the product of the variance of the rate fluctuations multiplied with the corresponding autocorrelation time.</p><p>In a slow modulation limit (in terms of the rate fluctuations), K W ≫ 1 and the (ensemble) averaged relaxation is approximately described by a quasistatic averaging of the time-dependent solutions with the static, "frozen" energy bias randomly distributed. It assumes a bi-exponential form, but can be multi-exponential and anomalously slow in a more general case of multistate fluctuations. The opposite limit of fast modulation (in terms of the rate fluctuations, K W ≪ 1) corresponds to the averaged rate description which is detailed above and which invokes the decoupling approximation and in addition can possibly involve a slow modulation limit in terms of the energy level fluctuations, K ǫ ≫ 1. The resulting averaged relaxation process remains approximately single-exponential.</p><p>In view of the presence of many different time scales the underlying physics is nontrivial. Therefore, it is useful to be able to resort to a case study where the stochastic averaging can be performed exactly. Such an archetypal investigation has been put forward in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[100]</ref> and has been applied to the stochastic spin-boson model in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">101]</ref>.</p></div>

It can also be used, however, for α &lt; 1 for an asymmetric case, ǫ 0 = 0, and/or for T &gt; 0, where the dynamics (in the absence of driving) is incoherent and where ∆ r = 0. The parameter domain, where this latter condition is fulfilled, is defined from the solution of a (more complicated than Eq.

Moreover, even for zero energy bias, ǫ 0 = 0, the renormalised tunnelling coupling vanishes at a sufficiently high temperature, παk B T &gt; ∆ <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[170]</ref>. Even more, for ∆ r = 0, the incoherent tunnelling regime holds obviously when k B T ≫ ∆ r .

The result in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_162">106</ref>) is in essence the Golden Rule result generalised here to fast fluctuating nonequilibrium fields. This fact underlines the generality and importance of the nonequilibrium Golden Rule result which is very useful in many applications. Many profound nonequilibrium effects described in this work can be rationalised within its framework. The structure of this result has a clear physical interpretation. Namely, F C(ω) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_166">110</ref>) is nothing but the spectral line shape of a quantum Kubo oscillator with the frequency modulated by the quantum Gaussian force ξ(t) in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_98">68</ref>) (in the corresponding Heisenberg representation) which has the complex-valued equilibrium autocorrelation function in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(69)</ref>. Due to the Gaussian character of the quantum random force, this spectral line shape in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_166">110</ref>) is expressed merely in terms of the doublyintegrated autocorrelation function K(t) and the reorganisation energy term in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_161">105</ref>). Due to the equilibrium character of quantum fluctuations, F C(ω) possesses a symmetry property, F C(-ω) = e -β ω F C(ω), which is enforced by the thermal detailed balance condition. It holds independently of the form of the bath spectral density J(ω) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, the thermal equilibrium for localised energy levels <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">19</ref> , p 1 (∞) = e -ǫ 0 /k B T p 2 (∞), holds always in the absence of nonequilibrium fluctuations of the energy levels. Furthermore, by splitting ξ into a sum of two arbitrary statistically independent components (two subsets of quantum bath oscillators), ξ = ξ1 + ξ2 one can show that F C(ω) can exactly be represented as a frequency convolution of the corresponding (partial) Franck-Condon factors F C 1 (ω) and F C 2 (ω) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_167">F C(ǫ) = ∞ -∞ F C 1 (ω)F C 2 (ǫ -ω)dω.<label>(111)</label></formula><p>Such frequency convolution can be generalised to an arbitrary number of partitions. The nonequilibrium Golden Rule in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_165">109</ref>) presents an additional frequency convolution with the spectral line shape I(ω) of the nonequilibrium Kubo oscillator which corresponds to a generally non-Gaussian and nonequilibrium stochastic force. I(ω) does now no longer possess the above symmetry imposed by thermal detailed balance. Thus, the violation of the thermal detailed balance condition by the nonequilibrium fluctuations lead generally to intriguing nonequilibrium effects described in Sec. 5, and below.</p><p>It is important to notice that the localised states can be stabilised by strong, fast oscillating periodic fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[183]</ref> and the Golden Rule description is generally improved for such fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[97]</ref>. This latter fact can be readily understood from the representation of the (quantum) stochastic force as a sum of statistically independent components. Namely, if ∆ r = 0, due the interaction with a subset of oscillators, the addition of an interaction with further oscillators cannot enhance ∆ r . It will work always in the direction to make the effective tunnelling coupling smaller (when ∆ r = 0), thus improving the perturbation theory in ∆. Replacing equilibrium oscillators with a fast fluctuating field does not change this trend.</p></div>

The intersite coupling between the intramolecular vibrations is however neglected (like in the Einstein model of optical phonons), i.e. the electron (or hole) energy levels in neighbouring molecules (or molecular groups) are assumed to fluctuate independently. In other words, one assumes uncorrelated identical thermal baths formed by vibrational degrees of freedom of each molecule in a molecular chain.

The corresponding experimental results were seemingly consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">[199]</ref> with a mechanism of incoherent sequential tunnelling like one just described. The occurrence of the ANM phenomenon for a sinusoidal driving within the considered dissipative tight-binding model has been demonstrated in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">[196]</ref>.</p><p>The question we addressed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[69]</ref> within a Holstein like model was whether an external stochastic field can also induce ANM. The occurrence of such noise-induced ANM has been shown for dichotomous Markovian fields. ANM presents a multi-state analogy of the effect of inversion of populations in TLS described in Sec. 5. A simple criterion for ANM to occur can be found within the quasi-static approximation for the spectral line shape I(ω). For a symmetric dichotomous field Ẽ(t) = ( σ/ea)α(t) with the inverse autocorrelation time ν, this quasi-static approximation holds whenever σ ≫ ν, being almost always the case in the relevant regime of parameters even if the field fluctuations are fast on the time-scale of the charge transfer.

Then, j(E 0 ) &lt; 0 for a sufficiently small static force, eE 0 &gt; 0, whenever σ &gt; σ max <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[69]</ref>, i.e. whenever the charge transfer is driven into the regime of negative differential conductance by some appropriately chosen alternating, two-state stochastic fields.

For this nonadiabatic small polaron model the regime of negative differential mobility occurs for E 0 &gt; E max with E max defined implicitly by the equation eaE max = 2W p coth( eaEmax 2k B T ). Quasi-one-dimensional systems exhibiting this small polaron conductance (in the nonadiabatic ET regime with respect to ∆) can be considered along with the semiconductor superlattices as possible candidates to exhibit the phenomenon of noise-induced ANM experimentally.

For superlattices with a larger period a, E max can be much less <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">[199]</ref>. Basically, this crucial quantity is determined by two factors: (i) the width of F C(ω) due to multi-phonon transitions (it depends on the precise mechanism of dissipation and should be made as small as possible) and (ii) the lattice period a (it should be engineered as large as possible). These criteria can serve as a useful guides in identifying the appropriate experimental materials.</p></div>

The first case of a quantum ratchet in a periodic spatially asymmetric (ratchet)-potential was studied theoretically in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[204]</ref> within a semi-classical approach and for an adiabatically varying driving field. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">104]</ref>, we put forward periodic dissipative nonadiabatic quantum rectifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">[209]</ref> operating in the absence of spatial asymmetry. The current is produced by a nonlinear transport mechanism due to an interplay between equilibrium quantum fluctuations and an unbiased, but asymmetric nonequilibrium external noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[70]</ref>. Likewise, an asymmetric periodic driving of the harmonic mixing type can be used instead of the nonequilibrium noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">104]</ref>. Our rectifier behaves genuinely quantum mechanically and corresponds to the case of a strong dissipation when the transport mechanism is incoherent and the transport proceeds by incoherent tunnelling hopping as outlined above. The origin of the resulting current can be traced to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_184">123</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_186">124</ref>). Namely, j(0) = 0, when S(τ ) assumes a complex values, i.e., Im S(τ ) = 0. This corresponds to a complementary criterion which follows from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_186">124</ref>).

Namely, to the lowest order, the current is proportional to E 3 (t) , j(0) ∝ E 3 (t) ≈ bσ 3 (b ≪ 1), with a nontrivial prefactor. Moreover, the current flows into the direction of e 3 E 3 (t) , which is the direction of the larger force realization, if the applied random force is sufficiently small. With an increase of the noise rms σ the current can however reverse its direction. In the considered approximations and for a small driving asymmetry b ≪ 1 this occurs when σ exceeds some maximum associated with F C(ω). Thus, this change of the current direction from the expected to physically counter-intuitive direction is closely related to the mechanism of noise-induced absolute negative mobility, as it has been outlined in the previous subsection. Moreover, the current can flow in the physically counter-intuitively direction also for small applied forces when the coupling strength α is sufficiently small.

Its origin presents a highly nonlinear and nonequilibrium statistical effect. This result does not hold for more general situations. For the case of the full potential problem, with its intrinsic interband transitions, a finite, stationary current can be generated even in the absence of dissipation; it results as a dynamical effect due to an interplay of a nonlinear dynamics and the breaking of some space-time symmetries by the driving mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">212,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">213]</ref>.</p><p>It must be emphasised, however, that the full potential problem has little relation to the electron transport in molecular chains which is our main focus here.

The nature of those fluctuations, that usually stem from the influence of externally applied fields, or intrinsic degrees of freedom, is either of stochastic or coherent deterministic origin. Our general findings are applied to specific situations, encompassing solid state applications, but mainly we did focus on the theme of driven electron transfer in molecular aggregates.</p><p>A first major result is the derivation of the generalised non-Markovian master equations and the generalised Redfield equations for quantum systems composed of a finite, discrete number of states which are subject to the influence of external either stochastic, or periodic fields. The resulting kinetic equations allow one to study a rich variety of different physical problems within a unified framework. In simplest cases, the relevant part of the reduced dynamics is either described by the Markovian balance equation of the Pauli master equation type <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[220]</ref> which is generalised to include the influence of explicit time-dependent, external field manipulations into the quantum transition rates; those becoming therefore functionals of the driving field, or by its generalisation which accounts as well for the memory effects in the corresponding dissipative kernels.</p><p>In the case of fast (on the time scale of the averaged relaxation process) fluctuating, or oscillating fields these quantum kinetic equations can be averaged. The relaxation transitions can be described by the averaged quantum transition rates of the Golden-Rule type.

This violation of the thermal detailed balance, being induced by the nonequilibrium driving fields, in turn paves a roadway for identifying several intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena.</p><p>An important case is provided by symmetric dichotomous driving fields for which our approximate theories and considerations can be made rigorous, tested and reaffirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">101]</ref> because the corresponding averaging can be performed exactly.</p><p>The problem of averaging a quantum dynamics in stochastic fields modelled by non-Markovian processes of the continuous time random walk type with a discrete number of states (with Markovian processes emerging as a particular limiting case) has been investigated in the absence of dissipation in Sec. 2. Using a classical stochastic path integral approach, we obtained some general exact results on the averaging of quantum propagator of the driven quantum system over the stationary realizations of such non-Markovian jump processes. In particular, the exact result for the Laplace transform of the correspondingly averaged quantum propagator has been obtained. This novel result bears the potential for future applications since it opens a way for a rigorous study of an extreme case of 1/f α noise, implying long-range temporal correlations, where standard perturbation theory is expected to fail. As a first important application, we obtained the spectral line shape of the corresponding Kubo oscillator and the Laplace-transformed averaged evolution of a spin 1/2-system that is driven by a symmetric alternating renewal process possessing an arbitrary distribution of the residence times. This implies a very broad class of autocorrelation functions including those which correspond to noise sources with 1/f α power spectrum. This general result is shown to reproduce the known solution in the Markovian limit, i.e. when the the residence time intervals are exponentially distributed.</p><p>Starting out with section 4, we have investigated the combined influence of fluctuating parameters and dissipation on the evolution of the corresponding quantum dynamics. In doing so, we considered both the role of fluctuations of the energy bias, and/or the effects of a fluctuating intersite tunnelling matrix element. A generalised master equation was obtained which corresponds to the known NIBA approximation obtained within the quantum path-integral approach. The obtained master equation was averaged exactly both over dichotomous fluctuations of the energy bias and dichotomous fluctuations of the tunnelling coupling, i.e. the case with a fluctuating tunnelling barrier. These results have been used to study a rich repertoire of nonequilibrium phenomena for electron transfer in condensed media with dynamical disorder and possibly being driven by stochastic or deterministic, coherent periodic laser fields.</p><p>In section 7 we have studied the quantum transport in extended quantum systems within a tight-binding description, with the dynamics being subjected to a strong system-bath coupling and weak tunnelling, i.e. in the limit of an incoherent hopping regime. A general result for the quantumnoise assisted transport current, being averaged over the field fluctuations, has been derived. The corresponding expression is shown to be equivalent to the NIBA approximation result of a corresponding quantum path integral treatment.</p><p>Our theory for dissipative systems with fluctuating parameters predicts scores of interesting nonequilibrium phenomena that are the result of a stunning interplay between equilibrium quantum fluctuations and nonequilibrium perturbations. A few noteworthy such effects are: (i) the suppression, or acceleration of quantum transition rates by many orders of magnitude; (ii) a noise-induced enhancement of the thermally assisted quantum tunnelling; (iii) the inversion of populations in the spin-boson model; or (iv) a noiseinduced absolute negative mobility in quantum transport. We further elaborated on the theme of dissipative quantum rectifiers. Several of these novel predictions are presently being investigated in a number of research groups, both theoretically and experimentally. Our research in particular also impacts such timely activities like the investigation of the electronic transport in infrared laser driven molecular wires <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">[221]</ref>. Here, the fermionic thermal baths are provided by the electronic reservoirs in the leads and the electron transport through the wire is mainly coherent. This corresponds to the regime of a weak dissipation within our approach, being opposite to the regime of incoherent tunnelling. The role of the size, inter-electrode coupling effects, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[222]</ref> as well as the inelastic Coulomb repulsion effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[223]</ref>, are also important for molecular wires.

The asymptotic population difference P ∞ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence versus the asymmetry ǫ 0 when combined with a high frequency driving field. For appropriate values of bias ǫ 0 , a population inversion takes place (P ∞ &lt; 0 when ǫ 0 &gt; 0, and vice versa).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Weak system-bath coupling</head><p>Let us consider first the case of a weak system-bath coupling. The corresponding generalised master equations are obtained by applying Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">61</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(62)</ref> (in the representation of γnm ) to the considered spin-boson model. This yields after some cumbersome calculations by using the quasi-spin basis the following GMEs:</p><p>with the kernels reading</p><p>and the inhomogeneous terms given by</p><p>The evolution operator of the driven TLS in the absence of coupling, which defines the Hamiltonian H D (t) of the driven, nondissipative dynamics, is denoted by</p><p>For the case of vanishing dissipation, Q(t) = 0, and for ∆ 0 = 0, the solution of this integro-differential equation for σ z (t) for the initial condition σ z (0) = 1 yields the same result as in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(35)</ref>. This agreement provides an additional test for the mutual consistency of different methods of stochastic averaging used here. Furthermore, in the absence of dissipation the rate of incoherent relaxation exhibits a resonance-like feature as a function of the frequency ν of the barrier fluctuations. Namely, a resonance occurs when ν matches the transition frequency ǫ 0 , i.e. ν = ǫ 0 (see Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(37)</ref> in Sec. 2.3.2). This presents a physical stochastic resonance, which should not to be identified with a wellknown phenomenon of noise-assisted Stochastic Resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[188]</ref>. It occurs when a stochastic frequency of the driving matches an eigenfrequency of a quantum transition. In the presence of dissipation, this resonance feature is maintained, but becomes modified. Namely, the resonance can occur at ν = |ǫ 0 ±λ/ |, rather than at ν = ǫ 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67]</ref>. This resonance is responsible for the interesting phenomenon of a stochastic acceleration of dissipative quantum tunnelling which is predicted by the theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67]</ref>: For the case that ∆ := ∆ 0 , when ∆(t) fluctuates between zero and 2∆ 0 the rate of incoherent transfer can exceed that for the static tunnelling barrier with tunnelling coupling strength ∆(t) = 2∆ 0 =const. At the first sight, this effect seems paradoxical; it must be remembered, however, that the considered noise is nonequilibrium and it is capable of pumping energy into the system enhancing thereby the rate of incoherent quantum tunnelling. Unfortunately, for the parameters typical for molecular ET the experimental conditions for this effect to occur can barely be met experimentally because the required frequency ν is too high. Nevertheless, this fact does not invalidate the principal possibility of the discussed effect for some other physical systems in view of the generality of the model set-up.</p><p>In contrast, when ∆(t) fluctuates very slowly on the time-scale of decay of kernels f (t) and g(t), which corresponds roughly to the inverse of the width of corresponding Franck-Condon factor F C(ω), then our theory predicts -after use of the Markovian approximation -the known results which corresponds to the approximation of a dichotomously fluctuating rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[189]</ref>, see also discussion in Sec. 5.3. The corresponding problem of such fluctuating rates is known under the label of dynamical disorder and can be met in quite different areas of physics and chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[190]</ref>. Depending on the relation between the stochastic frequency ν and the values of transfer rates corresponding to the "frozen" instant realizations of ∆(t), the transfer kinetics can exhibit different regimes of a (i) quasi-static disorder, (ii) an averaged rate description, and (iii) a gated regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[67]</ref>. In the latter case, the mean transfer time becomes locked to the autocorrelation time of the fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">191]</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
