<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The production of ice cream has become very popular in the last decade, showing a gradual increase in food consumption preference, generating millions of dollars in the international market, becoming a sector with great technological progress helping to improve the ice cream industry. Even so, there are companies that carry out the processes in an artisanal manner or with little technological modernization, as in the case of Bonanza. The objective of this article is to improve productivity through the use of method engineering tools and industrial automation in the production of the ice cream line of the Bonanza company. In a guided inspection, the operations diagram, process analysis and route diagram were determined. Finding dead times, bottlenecks, congestion and misuse of resources. With the help of Autodesk Inventor, Labview and TinkerCAD programs, the design and simulation of automated machines for the process of cleaning, inspection and weighing of fruit was carried out. This allowed to go from 30 min, 41 min and 65 min to 14 min and 20 minutes by merging the last two processes respectively. In addition to improving all internal processes and restructuring the path of the route. In conclusion, with the implementation of this project, the product execution time was reduced by 3 hours, optimal resources and increased productivity in the Bonanza company.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</formula><p>In the last decade, the production of ice cream has become increasingly famous, including those that maintain low levels of sugar or fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Since about five years ago, it has captured notoriety among Indonesians demonstrating the gradual increase, preference for ice cream food consumption and steady sales, in annual growth representing 5.3% growth from 2014 to 2019 period. Managing to increase the volume of the ice cream industry in 2018 by 60.1%, compared to the last two years with 48.9% and 54.4%, being driven by the low-income segment by 62%, due to new manufacturers offering low-end varieties in line with the pocket of the segment compared to high-end offered by market leaders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Being the same manufacturers in the decision making in production, due to the analysis of sales of different types of ice cream in retail stores from the purchase videos of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In the summer season it is considered a popular dessert making the U.S. ice cream market to reach 7600 million dollars in 2021 and the world market to reach about 50 billion dollars year after year <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Ice cream is a functional food with great potential because it can be fused with various fruits rich in phenols, probiotics and prebiotics. In addition, it is in great demand by consumers, since it can be consumed by people from 7 to 70 years of age in most countries of the world and is appreciated for its balanced food characteristics, delicious flavors, good nutritional properties and refreshing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Recent analyses determined that the addition of mammalian milks in ice cream is a suitable food matrix for probiotics, containing rich sources of macro elements and for its high digestibility. With the help of natural antioxidants, they can replace artificial colorants to avoid producing allergic reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Being a food processing sector, the level of hygiene should be relatively high, however, there are defects on the surface, the most common being blue spots, crust material and knot. The first defect is produced by the presence of fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Currently, advanced technology is being implemented to improve the process in the ice cream industry, to remove traditional methods based on relay controls with simple and easy to control times obtaining very low precision and poor quality ice cream, by a simple control management causes the machines to be damaged or spoiled more easily obtaining ice cream with different consistency, hardness and flavor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The field of intelligent or automated home appliances attracted much attention, improving the limits in industrial plants to the outside world. Through the very promising e-Maintenance service, it is possible to interact remotely with the refrigeration machines, allowing technicians to check configuration, update software modules, the current and past status. With this technology, it is possible to solve problems that occur in companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In a guided inspection carried out at the Bonanza company located in Jauja, which belongs to the Junín region of Peru. It is observed that the ice cream production line is still made manually or little industrialization, generating low productivity, bottlenecks and downtime in production. A very important point to increase the company's profits is to guarantee the planned productivity through technological processes, whose final indicator is the production yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This article aims to implement automated processes to improve productivity in the Bonanza company, by means of methods engineering to identify bottlenecks and dead times, allowing to restructure the ice cream production line and optimize times with the help of technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>To achieve the optimization of time lapses in the ice cream production line of the company Bonanza, the Ishikawa diagram was used to know and establish the problem or effect to analyze, then performed an analysis with the help of the Methods Engineering, because it was observed bottlenecks along the process generating that these activities are not carried out efficiently, this technique reduces the work content of a process or operation to increase production. Likewise, VDI 2206 was used for the improvement proposal due to the implementation of a mechatronic design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Cause-effect diagram</head><p>The Ishikawa diagram is used because it is a method that graphically shows the identification and solution of causes of an event, this scheme allows finding the initial origins of a problem in a structured way. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows that there is a decrease in productivity in the ice cream production line, generating various scenarios that directly and negatively affect its production, as well as inadequate handling of materials, lack of raw materials, overtime, insufficient machine capacity. However, the main cause is the absence of a process or procedure manual and the lack of standardization of times. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Methods engineering</head><p>The purpose of the methods engineering approach is to optimize the processes, operations, tasks and including the design of instruments. Internally, industrial processes have activities that increase value to the process and those that cause costs; therefore, it is recommended that the latter be compressed to the maximum and, if feasible, eliminated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The Bonanza company is recognized for its ice cream production services; however, it has deficiencies in the fruit weighing and inspection stage, creating a bottleneck that generates low productivity in the production line. From the engineering approach, the production process will be analyzed through the use of three movement study tools: process operation diagram (PDO), process analysis diagram (PDA) and stroke diagram (ST).</p><p>a) PDO: When using the operations diagram, whose purpose is to identify, inspect and operationalize a process from the entry of raw materials to the completion of the product, the ice cream production line lacks an optimal work structure in the operation of washing and inspection of fruits, which leads to delays and downtime, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. b) PDA: The analytical process diagram details the operation, distance, transport, storage, delay, time, among others, that is used in a product to perform a more detailed analysis of the process. Currently the working method of the company Bonanza has unnecessary activities and repetitive operations which generates a low productivity, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. it is evident that the washing and inspection of fruits generate unnecessary delays that could be combined with a mechatronic design.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Management indicators</head><p>In order to estimate productivity, reference was made to the book Estudio del trabajo: Ingeniería de métodos y medición del trabajo <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> where it mentions that productivity is given by the product of efficiency and effectiveness; equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), shows the general model.  <ref type="formula">2</ref>), and efficacy is also related to the achievement of the proposed objectives as shown in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.cscc</p><p>(2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">! "!# $!#%!&amp; ! (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Mechatronics regulations</head><p>The VDI 2206 standard is applied for mechatronic systems due to the complexity, interdisciplinarity and heterogeneity containing data interfaces with components and devices that is currently on the rise. The standard in 2021 supports the development of process structuring with an extended V-model aspect, detailing the processes from requirements to delivery for use. In addition, the guideline does not have specification of methods or tools to be used, leaving the reader to make a deduction approach, achieving better definitions and cost estimates of the project. The methodology is performed in 4 phases to perform simulation, modeling and prototyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS</head><p>The following results were obtained by applying methods engineering in the Bonanza company, improving productivity and process in an automated way in the bottlenecks and dead times found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Design of automated machines</head><p>With the help of the program Autodesk Invertor Professional, automated machines were designed for the transport, washing, inspection, weighing and selection of optimal fruits for the production of ice cream line in the company Bonanza.</p><p>At the beginning of the production line, a metal tray was designed for storing the fruit. Once production is started, a vertical conveyor belt carries the product individually by means of its pallets, allowing the separation to carry out the other processes correctly and prevent the fruit from falling over the sides because it is agglomerated. Once the fruit is individually placed, it is transported to the next process by means of the blue conveyor belt, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. The second automated process is the washing and drying of the fruit by means of water pressure, achieving to enter the product and when falling into the machine, by means of water pipes an amount of water is introduced into a well to remove simple impurities so as not to splash in case it is dirty with mud or other simple impurities. In the superior part of the exit conveyor belt the red pressure pipes are observed to make the final cleaning, by means of pressure jets to be able to give a deep cleaning and all this water can be poured to the well, with the help of the green drainage in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> the excess of water is extracted and by means of a pumping system every certain time or impurities detected in the water. Once the fruit is free of impurities on the side of the belt, turbines are activated to dry the fruit quickly and then it is passed to the white conveyor belt to be inspected and weighed, separating the good and bad quality fruit. The latter is removed when the red light is turned on to a side box for the personnel to discard it, while the good fruit as shown in Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Obtaining all these data smoothly and without delays helps to solve the bottleneck encountered. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Process automation</head><p>An HMI environment developed in LabVIEW software was designed to supervise the automated process, as well as to obtain estimated cleaning, weighing and inspection times for each fruit. The first and last subprocess will be developed in collaboration with personnel who will observe the product inside the lead box in real time using cameras Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. Otherwise, if any of these two is incorrect, a red light will turn on to warn the picking collaborator and separate it from the process. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> shows the implemented HMI environment detailing 3 data (cleanliness, consumable and weight) and the control of 4 cameras at different angles. To obtain the weight was simulated in the TinkeCAD program, with the help of a force sensor obtaining results in Newtons, which when divided by gravity we obtain the Mass (Kg) of each fruit. This value is entered to the HMI interface obtaining all the data for the ice cream line process. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> shows the programming and the electronic circuit. However, as it is implemented in a real way, industrial components must be used in order to obtain more accurate data. For the washing process a time of 8sec per fruit was obtained and for the inspection-weighing process a time of 12sec was obtained. For the same quantity of fruit (100 units), a total of 14 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, was obtained. The first process was reduced by 16 minutes and the second by 75 minutes, since the inspection and weighing process was combined by automation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparison of DAP proposals</head><p>By means of the proposal of the current DAP, it was proposed to make certain changes in repetitive operations as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>; the combination of washing and weighinginspection activities was carried out using the automation machine, so that the execution time has a reduction of approximately 3 hours per day as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Improve the Bonanza company's route diagram</head><p>In order to improve the Bonanza company's route shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>, changes were made to the analytical process diagram, taking into consideration the continuity of production area I, cold storage room and production area II to make the best use of space as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref>, and at the same time optimize production time. Productivity was determined using the aforementioned formulas from the database obtained, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. Before the research, productivity was 76.36% and with the implementation, 86.97% was obtained, improving by 10.61%. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This research work made a proposal for engineering improvement in the optimization of processes in the production of ice cream, since according to the Ishikawa diagram it was required to supply the problem of low productivity, so methods engineering was applied using flow diagrams such as DAP and DOP to identify the presence of unproductive and dead times. In this document, activities such as fruit weighing-inspection were optimized through the design of the automated machine, seeking to generate a reduction in time and shortening work movements.</p><p>With the design software, the simulated automation process for obtaining times and the infrastructure of the machines was shown. In addition, the incorporation of the HMI environment for the quick interaction of the personnel in charge of the area with the machine for the respective inspection and monitoring.</p><p>Thanks to the route diagram it was possible to elaborate systematic instructions that specify the places, likewise there is a better use of spaces which avoids congestion in the workers, also the route of the facilities of the company has an optimal design of continuity in the areas of production and cold storage room.</p><p>By means of industrial automation, process times were optimized, achieving a reduction of 3 hours in execution and increasing productivity from 76.36% to 86.97% in the ice cream production line of the Bonanza company, allowing work to be done with greater productivity and making the most of resources. Being an automated process allows to have a clear and precise control, having a control of the production compared to the traditional way that was done, generating higher costs and more resources man-hours. CKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks to the Peruvian company Bonanza, for carrying out the guided inspection and providing the production data to perform improvement diagnostics for process automation through methods engineering. In addition, recognition to Universidad Continental, for providing the necessary knowledge for the development of research and projects in the engineering area.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
