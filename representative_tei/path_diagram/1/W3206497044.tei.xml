<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>introduction</head><p>Grounded in the framework of self-determination theory (SDT), over the last 30 years, numerous studies have investigated individuals' motivations in different settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. People may engage in activities for different reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. When athletes engage in an activity for the satisfaction and pleasure derived from the activity, they are intrinsically motivated, whereas behaviors performed to attain material or social rewards are defined as providing extrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Intrinsically motivated behaviors are associated with satisfaction of three psychological needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. There are needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The basic needs hypothesis advanced by self-determination theory has also been examined in the context of sport <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>For most participants, participation in sports is intrinsically motivated. People participate in sports due to intrinsic motives, such as enjoyment and interest, more often than due to extrinsic goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, whereas exercisers are more likely to be motivated by extrinsic motives, such as improving one's appearance. Contexts fostering autonomy and perceived competence enhance enjoyment and sustain motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Sustained exercise is more likely to occur when a person has both well-internalized extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The motivation for engaging in sports and exercise extends beyond intrinsic motivation. People also have many extrinsic reasons for engaging in sports, from health reasons to a desire for recognition. Self-determination theory includes two broad classes of nonintrinsic motivation: extrinsic motivation, which is behavior motivated by expected outcomes that are not inherent to the activity itself, and amotivation, which is the lack of energy directed toward an action or intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Extrinsic motivation can vary in the degree of self-determination along a self-determination continuum ranging from nonself-determined (extrinsic and introjected regulation) to self-determined (identified and integrated regulation) forms of extrinsic motivation. People are typically viewed as having multiple motives, both extrinsic and intrinsic ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Optimal motivational function is achieved through the satisfaction of a person's needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Cognitive evaluation theory describes the environmental contingencies that lead to the adoption of intrinsically or extrinsically motivated behaviors. The organismic integration theory identifies the quality of motivation on a scale of perceived locus of causality. These causalities are ranked from highly autonomous to highly controlling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In his hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, Vallerands <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> claims that different motivations exist at three levels of generality: the global, contextual, and situational levels. These social factors are mediated by perceived; self-determination, competence and relatedness, which leads to different types of motivation (intrinsic, extrinsic and amotivation). The consequences of this are global, contextual or situational; affect, cognition and behavior. Sport participation will be a part of the contextual level.</p><p>Intrinsically motivated behavior includes activities people do only for enjoyment, pleasure, and fun, where there are no rewards or discernible reinforcements involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Autonomous regulation is associated with actions and maintenance of change for exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, exercise-related self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, greater physical fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, more frequent self-reported exercise behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, and more positive attitudes toward exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40]</ref>. Autonomy-supportive coaches acknowledge athletes' feelings and perspectives and allow them to be involved in the decision making process, while those adopting a controlling style are characterized by a highly directive style of interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>. Perceived autonomy support from friends is positively associated with identified regulation and intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. Perceived autonomy support from exercise instructors positively predicts relatedness, autonomy, competence need satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref>. Research has demonstrated the value of perceived autonomy support from the coach and task-involving climate in predicting the intrinsic motivation in athletes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. This study also suggested that perceived autonomy support from the coach can facilitate a later task-involving peer motivational climate.</p><p>Satisfaction of psychological needs is positively correlated with identified and introjected regulation and intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44]</ref>. In terms of competence satisfaction, introjected and identified regulations can positively predict strenuous exercise behavior, whereas external regulation is a more negative predictor of strenuous exercise behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Competence satisfaction also has both direct and indirect effects on behavioral investment.</p><p>People are driven to achieve for different reasons. According to the achievement goal theory, the reasons why they strive to achieve pertain to the standards for judging their own competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. They orient themselves toward meeting these competence standards. If people endorse mastery goals, they are concerned with learning, growth, or understanding. In a sense, they are immersed in the achievement task itself and preoccupied with their own expertise in the domain. If they endorse performance goals, they are concerned about achievement in relation to others or with how competent they appear to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. Task orientation focuses on self-referenced mastery or improvement in relation to one's own standards. Success is perceived when learning, improvement, and mastery are achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. Ego-oriented athletes are concerned with gaining positive judgements from others and compare their performance to that of competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. Achievement goal theory assumes that goal orientations are not bi-polar opposites of the same construct but, rather, are independent of each other. This means that an individual can be high and/or low in both orientations at any given time <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref> In psychology, the theory talks about ego-and task-oriented athletes. Ego-oriented athletes who rate their ability as inferior to that of competitors are vulnerable to somatic and cognitive anxiety before and during performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. People are more likely to drop out of competitions, set standards for their performance that are unrealistically high or low, and rate competitions or evaluations as unimportant if they have a low estimate of ability and are ego-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. Ego-oriented athletes often have pressure from coaches and parents to reach exact goals and have concerns about making mistakes. Task-oriented athletes may also set exact goals, but these goals conform to the athlete's own standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>. Ego-oriented athletes are also more likely to view their ability as fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Athletes who are task-oriented are less vulnerable to somatic and cognitive anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>. They have more control over factors that lead to failure and success; this also contributes to heightened enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref> and intrinsic interest in sport <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Many athletes have multiple goal orientations. Optimal performance may result from the endorsement of moderate to high levels of ego and task orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>. Top 10 athletes in major track and field championships are often driven by both ego and task goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>. A high task orientation may buffer the negative effects of a high ego orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62]</ref>.</p><p>Elite British adolescent athletes with moderate ego/higher task goal orientation use more self-talk than athletes with higher ego/lower task and moderate task/lower ego goal orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63]</ref>.</p><p>Coaches create motivational climates that encourage the development of task and ego orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref>. Task-oriented athletes are more likely to play for coaches who emphasize the mastery of enjoyment and skills. Effort results in success and improvement in task-involving climates. Ego-involving climates cause unequal recognition of participants, intra-team rivalry, and punishment for mistakes. Normative ability and deception are the most important factors in success <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref>. A study among young Japanese ice hockey players demonstrated that a task involving a climate created by coaches may not only influence players' task goal orientations but also their ego orientations. An ego-involving climate created by coaches may also influence players' ego goal orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[68]</ref>.</p><p>Task-oriented environments are likely to provide athletes with positive emotional experiences. Ego-oriented climates evoke unpleasant emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>. Ego-involving climates are also associated with negative personal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[70]</ref>, which leads to strategies that are unproductive for enhancing skills, for instance, avoidance of practice and claiming handicaps, such as fatigue and a lack of preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[71]</ref>. In these climates, young athletes worry about success and failure and are less content with team membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73]</ref>. Young athletes are more likely to drop out of sports when the motivational climate is highly ego-oriented and not mastery-oriented, and they judge their athletic ability as low <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75]</ref>. A study on Finnish junior ice hockey players found that a motivational climate emphasizing effort, personal development and improvement, and the achievement of goal mastering tasks are significant for enjoyment in junior ice hockey <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref>.</p><p>Ego-involving climates elicit amotivation and performance anxiety and decrease intrinsic interest. Ego climates also leads to more drop out of sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[77]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the general relationship between perceived coach autonomy, motivation, task and ego orientation, and perceived motivational climate in young ice hockey players. More specifically, the first aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among perceived autonomy from the coach, motivation, dispositional goal orientation, and the perceived motivational climate in 14-17-year-old Norwegian ice hockey players. The second aim was to investigate how perceived autonomy from the coach influences intrinsic motivation; integrated, identified, introjected, and external regulation; and amotivation.</p><p>We expected to find a positive path from the perceived autonomy support via the most autonomous motives to task involvement and then to the task environment. We also expected to find a negative path from perceived autonomy support from the coach via the most controlling motives to ego involvement and then to the ego environment. We expected to find a direct positive relationship between perceived autonomy from the coach and the task environment and a direct negative relationship between perceived autonomy from the coach and the ego environment.</p><p>In this study we will look into the relationship between perceived coach autonomy, motivation, task and ego orientation, and perceived motivational climate in young ice hockey players.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ParticiPants</head><p>Participants included 401 young Norwegian ice hockey players aged 14-18 years old. This is probably about 1/3 of the players in this age. They were all voluntary participants on the Norwegian Ice Hockey federations talent camp. There was no selection of the players to the camp. Therefore, they should be representative of the whole population. Of the players, 49% were 15 and 16 years old. There were 49 girls and 352 boys. Ninety-four of the players were in Norwegian national U-20 and U-18 teams. All players who were later selected to be part of the U-16 team also participated. Only 59 players also competed in another sport outside of ice hockey. There were 59 goal keepers, 127 defenders, 201 forwards, and 19 players who were both forwards and defenders. We obtained parental consent to their participation in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>measures</head><p>The data were collected during a one-week hockey camp arranged by the Norwegian hockey federation. The players had one hour to complete the questionnaires. We used the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS-II) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[78]</ref> to measure the players' motivation. This is a revised version of the SMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[79]</ref>, containing 18 questions on 6 factors: intrinsic regulation, integrated regulation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, external regulation, and amotivation. All factors yielded reliable values with Cronbach's α scores between 0.57 and 0.72. Given the small number of items forming the factors, the internal validity observed can be marginally accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80]</ref>. Each factor contains three questions. The players were asked why they played ice hockey and had to answer on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1 to 7 (1 = do not agree at all, to 7 = completely agree).</p><p>To examine the perceived coach autonomy support, we used a short version of the Sport Climate Questionnaire (SCQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[81]</ref> with 6 items (α =0.82) worded in terms of "my coach". They were answered on a Likert-type scale from 1 to 7 (1 = do not agree at all, to 7 = completely agree). A high average score represented a high level of perceived autonomy support.</p><p>To measure the dispositional goal orientation, we used the Task and Ego orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[83]</ref>. The TEOSQ has a two-factor structure representing task (7 items, α = 0.82) and ego (6 items, α = 0.87) orientations. As the questionnaire was administered in an ice hockey context, players were encouraged to think about how successful they felt in relation to their team, and then they indicated on a 5-point Likerttype scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) whether they agreed or disagreed with items reflecting a task orientation (e.g., " I feel successful when I work really hard") or ego orientation (e.g., "I feel successful when others cannot do as well as me").</p><p>The Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2 (PMCSQ-2) was created to determine the athletes' perceptions of goals operating in an athletic setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">84]</ref>. The PMCSQ-2 has six subscales, which are transformed into two higher-order scales labeled task-involving (17 items, α = 0.88) (including cooperative learning α = 0.74, important role α = 0.80, and effort/improving α = 0.79 scales) and ego-involving (16 items, α = 0.91) (including punishment for mistakes α = 0.80, unequal recognition α = 0.89, and intrateam rivalry α = 0.52). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the six-factor model is marginally acceptable (with an intrateam rivalry subscale of α = 0.54 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">85]</ref>. To complete the PMCSQ-2, the players were requested to think about their participation in ice hockey and to indicate, on a 5-point Likert type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), whether they agreed with claims reflecting a task-(e.g., "in my team, players are encouraged to work on weaknesses") or ego-involving climate (e.g., "in my team, players are encouraged to outdo their teammates").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>statistical analysis</head><p>IBM SPSS Statistics 26 was used for calculation. Descriptive statistics, means, and standard deviations were obtained for all variables. Simple correlations were calculated to test relationships among all variables. To calculate the power of prediction between the independent variable "perceived autonomy from the coach", all 6 factors of motivation in the self-determination theory (SDT) and the goal orientation we conducted two path diagrams: one where task environment was the dependent variable and one with ego environment as the dependent variable (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>). Between these factors and goal orientation among the players and the dependent variables, a hierarchical regression analysis was employed. In this analysis, task and ego environments constituted the dependent variables. Only the paths showing significant relationships were included in the models. We tested for correlations between residuals with the Durbin-Watson statistic. Collinearity diagnostics were conducted by using the variance inflation factor (VIF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>results</head><p>Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and Cronbach α levels, as well as correlation statistics, are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The descriptive statistics for the entire sample revealed high levels of intrinsic motivation (mean (M) = 5.99), integrated regulation (M = 6.0), and identified regulation (M = 5.73). We found moderately high levels of introjected (M = 5.34) and external (M = 4.43) regulation and a low level of amotivation (M = 1.55). Task involvement was associated with a high level of intrinsic motivation (M = 4.52) and ego involvement (M = 3.01), while autonomy support from the coach (M=4.73) showed moderate levels.</p><p>When examining the correlation coeffcients f or t he fi ve m otivation s ubscales ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), the observed relationships showed that the theoretically closer factors were more strongly correlated. When examining the links between the motivational variables and the perceived autonomy, goal orientation, and perceived motivational climate, we observed that the most self-determined motivational variables had the strongest correlations with task involvement, autonomy support, and task environment. Task involvement had positive correlations with autonomy support and task environment, whereas ego involvementwas only correlated with an ego environment. We divided ego and task involvement into three different groups, where 1 and 2 were low, 3 was moderate, and 4 and 5 were high, and then created new variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that 34 participants (8.7%) were moderately task-and ego-involved, 227 (58.1%) were high task-involved and moderately ego-involved, 60 (15.3%) were high task-involved and high ego-involved, and 61 (15.6%) were high task-involved and low ego-involved. In the first path model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>), task environment was used as the dependent variable. Autonomic support from the coach was found to have a significant direct positive relationship with the dependent variable (p&lt;0.01) but also a positive significant relationship via intrinsic motivation and identified regulation (p&lt;0.01) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). We also found a negative relationship via amotivation (p&lt;0.05). Intrinsic motivation was found to have a significant direct positive relationship with the dependent variable "task environment" (p&lt;0.01). Task involvement was found to have a positive relationship with three of the motivational factors: intrinsic motivation (p&lt;0.01), identified (p&lt;0.05), and introjected (p&lt;0.01) regulation. Amotivation was found to have a negative relationship with task involvement (p&lt;0.01). Ego involvement was identified to have a negative relationship with intrinsic motivation (p&lt;0.05) and a positive relationship with external regulation (p&lt;0.05). Lastly, we found a positive relationship for task involvement and a negative relationship for ego involvement (both p&lt;0.01) with the dependent variable "task environment". The whole model explained 40% of the variance.</p><p>Model 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>) consisted of the same independent and intermediate variables as model 1. The paths between the variables were identical to those in model 1. The difference here was the dependent variable, "ego environment". The whole model explained 34% of the variance. The independent variable "autonomy support from the coach" was found to have a direct negative relationship with the dependent variable at the 1% level. It also had an indirect negative relationship via intrinsic motivation and amotivation. We found an indirect positive relationship via integrated regulation. We already observed that ego involvement had a negative relationship with intrinsic motivation and a positive relationship with external regulation and therefore has a relationship with the dependent variable "ego environment" through the intermediate variable ego involvement. The intermediate variables external regulation and amotivation were shown to have direct positive relationships with the dependent variable (both p&lt;0.01). Intrinsic motivation was shown to have a direct negative relationship with ego environment. Lastly, we found a positive relationship between the intermediate variable ego involvement and the dependent variable at the 1% level. No significant relationship was found between task involvement and ego environment.   The purpose of this study was to look into the relationship between perceived coach autonomy, motivation, task and ego orientation, and the perceived motivational climate in young Norwegian ice hockey players.</p><p>As we expected, the sample of national team hockey players scored highly for intrinsic motivation, and most of them showed autonomous regulation of extrinsic motivation. They also scored highly for introjected regulation, which means that they try to avoid external sources of disapproval or try to gain externally referenced approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. They also scored highly for task involvement and had medium scores for ego involvement. Most players (58%) were found to be high task-moderate ego involved. The theory confirms that optimal performance may result from endorsement of moderate to high levels of ego and task orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>. Positively, most Norwegian ice hockey players perceive the motivational climate as being task-oriented as we know that task-oriented environments are more likely to give athletes positive emotional experiences and ego-oriented climates evoke unpleasant emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> The first aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among perceived autonomy from the coach, motivation, dispositional goal orientation, and the perceived motivational climate in 14-17-year-old Norwegian ice hockey players. We found that theoretically related factors were more strongly correlated. Intrinsic motivation was found to correlate strongly with integrated and identified regulation, task involvement, and the task environment. At the same time, it did not correlate with ego involvement and had a negative correlation with amotivation (p&lt;0.01) and ego environment (p&lt;0.05). We also observed significant negative correlations among amotivation, task involvement, autonomy from the coach, and task environment. These results are as expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75]</ref>.</p><p>The second aim was to investigate how perceived autonomy from the coach influences the task environment via intrinsic motivation; integrated, identified, introjected, and external regulation; amotivation; and task-and ego-involvement. As expected, we found a significant (p&lt;0.01) positive link between perceived autonomy support from the coach, intrinsic motivation, and integrated-and identified regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[86]</ref>. We also observed a negative correlation between autonomy support from the coach and amotivation. There was, as expected, a direct positive (p&lt;0.01) link between autonomy support from the coach and task environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. This indicates that coaches who give their players autonomy support have a better chance of creating a task environment, which encourages effort from the players. A task-oriented motivational climate emphasizing effort, personal development, improvement, and achievement goal mastering tasks. This is important for enjoyment in junior ice hockey <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref>. We also observed a path from intrinsic motivation to task involvement and from task-involved athletes to the development of a task environment.</p><p>There was also a direct association between intrinsic motivation and task environment. Identified and introjected regulation were found to indirectly influence the development of a task environment via task involvement. No association was found between integrated regulation and task involvement, which was unexpected. It is not easy to explain why, as integrated regulation is the most autonomous extrinsic motive. This should be investigated further. There was a negative path from intrinsic motivation via ego involvement to task environment. To summarize, the results from our study indicate that perceived autonomy support from the coach will lead to higher intrinsic motivation and identified regulation, which will lead to more task-involved athletes, which then influence the environment to be a more task-motivated climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>. Hopefully, this will lead to ice hockey players who rate their abilities as being higher than those of their competitors and who are less vulnerable to somatic and cognitive anxiety before and during performance. They will also be less likely to drop out of competitions, will set standards for their performance that are realistically high, and will rate evaluations as important <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref>.</p><p>www.balticsportscience.com</p><p>The last aim of the study was to investigate how perceived autonomy from the coach influences intrinsic motivation; integrated, identified, introjected, and external regulation; and amotivation via ego-and task-involvement; and finally, whether it represents a path to ego environment. We found that a lack of perceived autonomy support from the coach had a direct significant (p&lt;0.01) effect on the development of an ego environment. If the athletes perceived low autonomy support from their coach, the development of an ego environment was more likely. Athletes who scored highly on external regulation were more ego-involved, and the possibility was higher that the environment would be more ego-oriented. The less autonomic the regulation, the greater the possibility that athletes are ego-involved, and the more an ego-oriented environment will develop. There is one exception: the players with a high score on integrated regulation, which is a highly autonomous motive, had a positive relationship with ego environment. This could because, if the players have a highly integrated regulation, an ego environment does not infect them too much. This finding is also partly supported by earlier research <ref type="bibr">[64-65, 72, 75]</ref>.</p><p>Limitations of the study. The inclusion and selection of the players can be a limitation when we talk about representativeness. The players in this study include the best players in this age group. They were all participants at the Norwegian ice hockey federations talent camp. The rationale for this decision was that it simplified the collection of data. It would also be interesting to do the same research in another sport to compare the results. Another limitation of this study is the players' age and the use of questionnaires that are validated for older participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>conclusions</head><p>We found that high perceived autonomy support from the coach positively influences motivation in junior hockey players. Players who perceive autonomy support from their coach have a higher chance of scoring highly for autonomic regulation, according to self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81]</ref> This probably leads to more task-oriented players who create a more task-oriented environment, hopefully resulting in fewer players dropping out of the sport.</p></div>
