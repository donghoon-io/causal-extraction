The condition encourages investment which relates to the implementation of strategies in order to create competitive advantage and improved performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barney, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Williams Jr et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In a dynamically changing and unpredictable environment, strategic resources are a key factor for success in business <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sirková et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Srivastava &amp; Srivastava, 2019)</ref>. According to some research findings, a strong relationship exist between positive psychological capital, business success and its performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sweetman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Luthans et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rego et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rau et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lazzarotti et al., 2020)</ref>.

It is usually valued when challenges such as an increase in financial capital are substantially dependent on endurance capital (that is, a collection of personal resources used for family businesses). It is also a strategic resource that affects both economic and non-economic performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baluku et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This study aims to examine positive psychological capital, market orientation, and business performances by utilizing different scientific approaches. This is important because empirically, interdisciplinary academic studies which tend to determine the factors that influence the performance of family businesses particularly in the culinary sector are rarely conducted.</p><p>Furthermore, the purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of positive psychological capital and market orientation on the performance of family businesses in the culinary sector in Makassar City, South Sulawesi Province. This is an interesting object of study, because sociocultural, people prefer to visit both modern and traditional culinary and the unique taste and superiority of the products offered to consumers, leads to intense competitions in this type of business.</p><p>This research was conducted in several stages, using multivariate analysis by means of Partial Least Square (PLS). The first stage involves the fabrication of problems and research questions by conceptualizing the phenomena in accordance to positive psychological capital, market orientation, and business performance, which therefore constitutes the basis for formulating the hypotheses. In the second stage, a research design based on theories, concepts, variables, dimensions, indicators, scale/measurement, question items in the research instrument was generated. The third stage involves the development of research instruments namely questionnaires. The fourth stage is the determination of samples based on the characteristics of family businesses involved in culinary. The fifth stage includes examining the validity and reliability of the research instruments. The sixth step comprises of the collection, reviewing and coding of data. The seventh stage involves testing the hypotheses through data processing, analysis, and interpretation.</p><p>The findings from this research succeeded in empirically formulating the hypotheses, therefore, certain suggestions that aids in improving the performance of family businesses involved in culinary are recommended. The subsequent section is centered on a theoretical foundation which examines the relationship between positive psychology and market orientation on business performance, while the research findings are based on hypothesis verification. The concluding aspect of this research is based on recent discoveries, the added value of this study for the development of family businesses, as well as the limitations.</p><p>This empirical research is based on issues encountered in achieving competitive advantage. However, in accordance with the ideas of experts in the field of strategic management, its generation is highly reliant on the compatibility between internal capabilities and changes in external conditions encountered <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alejandro et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>

A descriptive statistics which categorized the percentage of assessment scores on each question or item is used to review the perceptions of the respondents.</p><p>The hypotheses were formulated based on certain phenomena relating to the performance of culinary family businesses subsequently, they were also derived from theories and previous studies. Efforts to prove the testing process as well as the level of accuracy involved in the explanation, and prediction of an occurrence or relationship between phenomena are determined by the theory applied which is subject to offering comprehensive outcomes such as exposing certain facts that occur in the culinary family businesses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sekaran, (2000)</ref>, reported that explanatory study uses hypothesis testing of existing problems for a logical decision framework. This research focuses on scientific methods, which was used in identifying valid data analysis. Besides, a deductive approach was applied to theoretically analysis the hypothesis in order to determine the relationship between the variables. Similarly, the proposed theory is derived from the generalized hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Variables</head><p>This study is conducted to discover and analyze the influence of positive psychological capital and market orientation on the performance of culinary family business. In addition, it consist of independent (positive psychological capital and market orientation) and dependent (business performance) variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Luthans, Luthans, and Luthans (2004)</ref>, reported that positive psychological capital has certain dimensions based on the application of an ordinal scale namely, self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kohli and Jaworski (1990)</ref>, stated that market orientation includes the systematic collection of information concerning current and future customer needs, its dissemination to all organizational units/departments, as well as the designing and implementation of coordinated responses using ordinal scale. Family businesses is measured based on 2 (two) dimensions, which involves financial and non-financial performances. Financial performance is the perception of business actors towards profitability and sales growth. Non-financial performance is measured by customer and employee satisfactions using ordinal scale. The variables examined in this research are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data collection</head><p>This research used statistics of the culinary family businesses in Makassar City, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Primary and secondary data were collected during the implementation period from May to August 2018. Primary data is directly obtained from field research, conducted on the actors of culinary family business actors. Secondary data was extracted from the documentation of the office of Industry, Trade, and Investment of the city of Makassar, as well as the Department of Trade of the Province of South Sulawesi relating to reports on the characteristics of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, considering the fact that this type of business belongs to SMEs.</p><p>Questionnaire and documentation are techniques applied during data collection. The questionnaire which comprises of questions based on variables of positive psychology capital, market orientation, and business performance is the instrument used to investigate data acquired from the field. Simple and impartial words used in order for the respondents to understand and answer the questions with ease. Questionnaire items were adopted and developed from the theories of previous studies and it consists of several aspects.</p><p>Based on the research variables in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, each dimension of positive psychological capital, market orientation, and business performance, is developed into several indicator variables. Self-efficacy is operationalized with 3 indicators which include (1) setting exceptional targets for themselves and the desire to carry out difficult tasks, (2) accepting challenges in a pleasant and free-spirited manner, as well as being highly motivated and (3) efforts to achieve the targets that have been made and persistency when obstacles are encountered. Optimism is defined in accordance with 4 indicators namely (1) has good expectations in the future (2) a positive way of handling problems (3) a realistic way of reasoning and (4) feeling confident that they are able to control their future. Resilience is measured with 4 indicators such as (1) being able to withstand adversity, (2) able to rise again from conflict, (3) being able to progress again after failure and (4) able to learn and develop the challenges encountered. Hope is operationalized with 4 indicators namely (1) have a explicit goal concept, (2) the ability to develop specific strategies to achieve goals (3) the ability to trigger or boost motivation and (4) the ability to maintain motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Luthans, Youssef, &amp; Avolio, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, market orientation variables consist of 3 dimensions. The intelligence generation is operationalized with 4 indicators which include (1) the tendency to offer the best value to customers (2) being informed to be able to make predictions (3) processing information in order to be able to anticipate a changing market and (4) understanding customer needs and desires. The generation of dissemination is measured using 5 indicators namely (1) information concerning the market is distributed to all organizational elements, (2) adequate coordination of the organizational elements in utilizing information concerning the customers (3) there is mutual understanding of the market information communicated across to them, (4) there is openness in the communication between all organizational elements, and (5) acquired information is coordinated and implemented.

Secondary data was acquired through documentation, namely data relating to the respondents recorded by the Office of Industry, Trade, and Investment of Makassar city, and the Trade Service of South Sulawesi province.</p><p>The instruments used in this study were tested for validity and reliability. The validity of an instrument was tested by calculating the correlation between each question and the total score using the Product Moment correlation formula. Assuming r &gt; 0.30, then the statement items from the questionnaire is stated to be valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sekaran, 2000)</ref>. However, to test for the reliability of the instrument, the Cronbach's Alpha was applied and when the value is &gt; 0.60, the questionnaire is stated to be reliable or consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sekaran, 2000)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Sample size</head><p>This research was conducted on culinary family businesses in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, which consist of a number of sub-districts as well as food and beverage businesses activities in the industrial sector. The analysis unit used in the sample data of this research is entrepreneurs of the culinary family business at managerial level or business owners. The samples were considered capable due to their involvement in the current business development. Its distribution is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Higginson (2010) reported that there are differences in the dynamics as well as characteristics of each family business. The research samples were acquired based on certain characteristics such as family businesses that have been functional for at least two generations, gender of predecessors and successors, as well as number of successors, and employees as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Source: own compilation 121 Culinary family businesses were included to the research samples. In order to use partial least squares -structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a minimum of 100 samples is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Reinartz, Haenlein, &amp; Henseler, 2009)</ref>. However, based on the characteristics category, data was acquired from 121 culinary family business actors, which means that it exceeded the minimum required sample size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Data analysis methods</head><p>This study applied a variance-based SEM-PLS estimation to maximize explanations of variance in the dependent variable structural equation model. It was used because its component-based squares are effective causal modeling techniques, which allow estimation of measurements and path coefficients, simultaneously. This analysis is recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2013)</ref>. The inferential statistical data analysis was measured using SmartPLS (Partial Least Square) software starting from the outer, and inner model structure and hypothesis testing. PLS (Partial Least Square) uses the principle component analysis method in the measurement model. The variant extraction blocks is subject to investigate the relationship between indicators and the latent construct by calculating the total variance which consist of common, specific, and error variants (error variance).</p><p>The estimated SEM modeling parameters in accordance with the PLS approach is obtained through a three-stage iteration process using Ordinary Last Square (OLS). It includes determining the weight to set a score or calculate latent variable data and determine the path estimation (for inner and outer models). The analysis connects latent variables and estimate loading between latent variables and their indicators, as well as the average estimate and location of parameters.</p><p>Furthermore, the analysis of structural equation fit models was performed by SEM-Partial Least Square (PLS) using the SmartPLS software. This is conducted to produce a concept-based theory to design a structural model (the relationship between latent variables) and its measurement, namely the relationship between indicators and latent variables. The validity and reliability were used to evaluate the goodness of fit with the measurement model (outer model). The subsequent stage is the evaluation of structural models and finally the interpretation of the model.</p><p>Hypothesis testing is carried out by bootstrapping resampling method developed by <ref type="bibr">Stone (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Geisser (1975)</ref>. The test statistics used in this research is the t test, while the application of bootstrap resampling method, does not require normal distribution assumptions, and large samples. When a p-value ≤ 0.05 (alpha 5%) is obtained, it is reported as significant, and vice versa. Assuming the test results from the inner model are significant, then it is reported that there is a significant influence of latent variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Characteristics of respondents</head><p>The respondents of this study were 121 family business owners in the culinary sector. They were divided into four main characteristics, namely gender, education level, age, and type of culinary business. Men dominated the characteristics of respondents with 86 people (71%) and women 35 (29%). The level of education of respondents varied considerably with, 55 people (45%) in primary school, 18 people (15%) in junior high school, 29 people (24%) in high school and 19 (16%) in tertiary institutions.</p><p>Characteristics of respondents seen from the age level also showed variation as respondents were dominated by family business owners between the age of 41-50 years with 52 people (43%), 31-40 years by35 people (29%), 51 -60 years by 22 people (18%), and 20-30 years by 5 people (4%). Only seven people (6%) were above 60 years. This shows that the majority of respondents are in a productive age to run a business.</p><p>Characteristics of respondents are from the type of culinary business, which is divided into two including modern and traditional culinary businesses. Modern culinary is a type of family business that provides or sells food adopted from outside Indonesia. The traditional culinary is a type of family business that provides or sells food that comes from traditional values by traditional ethnic groups in Indonesia, and the Bugis Makassar tribe in South Sulawesi Province in particular. Family businesses that sell modern culinary are as many as 60 (45%) and those that sell traditional culinary are 61 (55%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Instrument validity and reliability</head><p>The results of the instrument validity test shows that all indicators in the research variable met the data validity requirements, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source: Computed by authors</head><p>The results of the validity test in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show that all indicators in the positive psychological capital, market orientation, and business performance had a Pearson correlation (correlation coefficient) above 0.30. Therefore, all indicators met the data validity requirements. This was preceded by the instrument reliability test as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data analysis</head><p>This study aims to determine the effect of positive psychological capital and market orientation on the performance of the culinary sector family business. Before determining the hypotheses, the goodness of fit was evaluated on outer models using convergent validity, discriminant, and composite reliability. The results of convergent validity testing are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. The evaluation of the goodness of fit on the outer model using the convergent validity, discriminant, and composite reliability, shows that the psychological capital and market orientation were positively correlated. The analysis showed that the prediction on the performance of the family business is in the good category. The t-values for each path were used to determine the partial effect of exogenous and endogenous variables with the results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. The findings of this study showed that the influence of positive psychological capital on business performance has an inner weight value of 0.341 with a t-value of 2.653. Therefore, positive psychological capital has a significant effect on the performance of the culinary sector family business. Furthermore, the effect of market orientation on business performance obtained an inner weight value of 0.214 with a t-value of 2.148. Hence, the market orientation has a significant effect on the performance of the culinary sector family business.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Discussion</head><p>One of the main objectives of this study is to determine the relationship between positive psychological capital and the performance of the culinary sector family business. This study found a significant and positive influence between positive psychological capital and business performance. The results consistently prove that success in entrepreneurship is a combination of financial and psychological aspects. Although financial performance plays an important role in assessing entrepreneurial success, a measure of psychological success, such as self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope leads to a more comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial success. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Luthans et al. (2004)</ref> stated that positive psychological capital consisting of selfefficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope increases profitability and organizational performance. Several other studies have reported the use of positive psychology capital to predict organizational performance and innovation capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lazzarotti et al., 2020)</ref>. Individuals with psychological characteristics such as self-confidence, the need for achievement and autonomy, self-efficacy, and internal locus of control have more capacity to take risks and become successful in entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Simoes et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The result shows that positive psychology capital is a potential that exists in people, which can be assessed and developed to produce self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Luthans et al., 2015)</ref>. Some studies stated that positive psychology capital improves business performance through creative behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sweetman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rego et al., 2012)</ref> and are positively related to performance in problem-solving and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Luthans et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the findings in this study indicate that entrepreneurial success is a combination of financial and psychological performance. The results also show that good business performance contributes to psychological state variables, which is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hmieleski &amp; Carr, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gorgievski et al., 2010)</ref>. Although financial performance is important in assessing entrepreneurial success, a measure of psychological success leads to a more comprehensive understanding.</p><p>Another purpose of this research is to analyze market planning towards improving the culinary family business. The result is consistent with the study carried out on empirical studio by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boohene et al., (2012)</ref>, which found a positive relationship between market facilitation and business performance. Similarly, the research carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dawes (2000)</ref>, stated that every dimension of market approval is always very closely related to business performance.</p><p>Various other studies also show that market orientation influences business performance. For instance, studies conducted by <ref type="bibr">Lings &amp; Greenly (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kelson (2012)</ref>, and Jaiyeoba (2014) also show a direct impact of market orientation on business performance. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pelham &amp; Wilson (2001)</ref>, a market-oriented business covers the ability to collect and handle good market information, predict its needs and changes accurately and quickly in order to increase their competitive advantage.</p><p>The result of this study shows that businesses are good at dealing with market opportunities due to activities based on customer needs. This is in accordance with the development of research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alkali and Isa (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zainal et al., (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Musa et al., (2018)</ref>. Furthermore, examining the ability of family businesses to translate data-based market change requires customer-based business activities, which needs to be synchronized with the management of customer data for long-term performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and limitations</head><p>The results from this research show that positive psychological capital has a significant influence on the performance of culinary family businesses. Therefore, self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope, has an influence on improving business performance. Also, this study shows that market orientation has a significant influence on the performance of the culinary sector, therefore, it is carried out in the process of acquiring and disseminating information, to all members or employee to encourage commitment in each organizational unit. Besides, a sensitive response to changes due to customer expectations and the presence of competitor, have a significant influence on improving the performance of family businesses.</p><p>The implication of this research is that in the formation of positive psychological capital, family business needs to increase its relevance by being able to translate changes in its external environment. This is an original research, which offers knowledge of the relationship between entrepreneurial psychological capital and market orientation in the culinary sector. However, there are several limitations associated with this study. Firstly, this research is only carried out on family businesses in the culinary sector, therefore it is not possible to generalize the entire family businesses. In the future, this research is also expected to be conducted in family businesses involved in agriculture, trade, services, and manufacturing. Secondly, questionnaires were used to acquire data in this study, therefore the specific description of various research variables, particularly those relating to positive psychology capital has not been obtained in its entirety. In addition, to discover the impact of psychological capital on business performance, qualitative methods such as case studies tend to be more accurate, particularly in exploring the various characteristics of family businesses.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
