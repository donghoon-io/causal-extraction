<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Today, factors such as technological developments, globalization and increasing population that reached unimaginable dimensions with industrialization, threaten the environment more and more <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For this reason, many countries are looking for solutions to environmental problems by signing treaties and conducting various projects. Many scientists support these efforts with scientific researches. The general opinion reached as a result of the researches is that many different dimensions exist in the relationship of individuals with the environment and examining the psychometric factors of individual behaviors is very important to find solution to environmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For this reason, the researches focused on providing environmental information to the individuals through environmental education and expected them to exhibit friendly behaviors towards environment and environmental problems. According to this behaviorbased environmental education approach, it is assumed that as the person's knowledge of the environment increases, his/her awareness of environmental problems will also increase. Increased level of awareness will bring environment-friendly behaviors. In short, this understanding implies a positive and linear relationship between the environmental awareness and the behavior of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. However, some other studies showed that there is not such a strong relationship between knowledge and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. In other words, the increasing the level of knowledge of the individuals does not guarantee a positive effect on their behavior towards environment. So a gap exists between knowledge and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Therefore, in order for individuals to adopt an environmentally sensitive life, that is to change their behavior, other factors supporting environmental knowledge are needed. One of these factors is the environmental identity of the individuals.</p><p>Environmental identity is defined as a measure of individuals' commitment to nature or their selfperceptions related to nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. It is thought that there may be a strong relationship between environmental identity and environment-friendly behaviors of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Because the relationships between individuals and the nature can provide insight about their environmental behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. From this point of view, in order to be able to prompt individuals to environment-friendly behaviors and to realize behavior change it is suggested to question the behaviors that exist in individuals. In this context, it is possible first to determine the environmental identity and behaviors of pre-service teachers who will raise the citizens of the future, and then to shape their education according to these determinations. This study serves to determine the environmental identity and behavior of pre-service teachers. In this context, a lot of researches are carried out with pre-service teachers in the relevant literature. There are various studies in the literature in which environmental literacy status of pre-service teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, their environment-friendly behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, and their attitudes towards the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> were examined. In addition, researches in which these psychometric factors (such as attitude, environment-friendly behavior, knowledge) were investigated are also available in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. According to the results of these researches it was found that; preservice teachers' environmental knowledge is insufficient, however they have environment-oriented way of thinking and positive environmental awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>; the attitudes towards the environment and the high level of environmental knowledge are not enough for the people to exhibit behaviors that are beneficial for the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>; the level of knowledge that middle and higher education students possess about environment is insufficient and they cannot fully understand the environmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding these studies and other studies in the related literature, it can be stated that although there are studies related to the different dimensions of environmental education supporting each other, the factors underlying the inability of individuals to exhibit environment-friendly behaviors were not identified, hence, what kind of environmental education individuals should take was not clarified. However, according to the behavior-based environmental education approach; the nature of environment-friendly behaviors should be understood, the factors affecting behaviors should be identified and educational interventions based on the manipulation of these factors should be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>.</p><p>According to this, it is thought that analyzing psychometric factors such as environmental identity, behaviors and environmental interests of the individuals with different and large samples, and using strong statistical techniques will provide important contributions to the literature. In this context, the purpose of this study was set as examining pre-service science teachers' environmental identity and their behaviors towards environmental problems according to gender and grade, determining the relationships between these variables and developing a Path diagram presenting the relationship between the variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RESEARCH METHOD</head><p>This research is structured based on the causal-comparative research and correlation research designs from the quantitative research designs. In the study, pre-service teachers' environmental identity and behavior towards environmental problems were examined according to gender and grade variables. This part of the research was carried out with causal-comparative research design, which examines the relationship between one or more categorical independent variables and one or more quantitative dependent variables to investigate the causes that have an impact on the phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. In this study, the categorical independent variables whose effect are examined are gender and grade, whereas quantitative dependent variables are preservice teachers' environmental identity and behaviors towards environmental problems.</p><p>The part of the research, where the relationship between pre-service teachers' environmental identity and their behaviors towards environmental problems is examined, was designed using correlational research design., which is conducted to examine the relationship between one or more quantitative independent variables and one or more quantitative dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>There were 215 pre-service teachers studying in science teaching department of a university located in Central Anatolia, who have been determined according to convenience sampling, participated in this study. Demographic characteristics of pre-service teachers are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Int</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data collection tools</head><p>The Environmental Identity Scale, which has been developed by Clayton <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and adapted to Turkish by Clayton and Kilinc <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, and the Environmental Problems Behaviour Scale, which has been developed by Guven and Aydogdu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, were used as data collection tools. Since the scales were not developed by the researchers, the literature was scanned, the scales that are thought to fulfill the subproblems were identified, and two experts having various studies in the field of environmental education were consulted about whether the scales can answer the research problems or not. Then, the permission was granted from the researchers who have developed the scales for using them.</p><p>The Environmental Identity Scale developed by Clayton <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> was used to determine the environmental identity of pre-service science teachers in the study. The original form of the scale consisted of 24 items of 5-point Likert type. Responses to items varied between 1 (Strongly Disagree) and 5 (Strongly Agree). In the studies conducted by Clayton <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was determined as 0.90 or higher. The Turkish adaptation of this scale has been made by Clayton and Kilinc <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> and the answers were transformed into 7-point Likert-type, varying between 1 (Not true at all) and 7 (Completely true). The reliability study of the Turkish version of the scale was performed by Clayton and Kilinc <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> in a study conducted with 808 participants studying at Ahi Evran University. Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient was found to be as 0.88. In our study, Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.883. Accordingly, since the internal consistency coefficient of the scale is above 0.70, it can be said that the scale is reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Another data collection tool used in the study is the Environmental Problems Behaviour Scale developed by Guven and Aydogdu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. The scale consists of 40 items of 3-point Likert type, ranging from "I don't agree", "I'm Neutral" and "I Agree", to determine whether the participants have carried out the behaviors towards environmental problems. Guven and Aydogdu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> has developed this scale in the spring term of 2009-2010 academic year, working with 203 pre-service teachers studying at science teaching department. Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient was found to be 0.85. In our study, Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.794. Accordingly, since the internal consistency coefficient of the scale is above 0.70, it can be said that the scale is reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data collection</head><p>In the data collection process, scales were applied to pre-service teachers studying at science teaching department, in the 2015-2016 academic year. The scales were applied by the researchers. Before the applications, the participants were informed about the subject and the purpose of the research, and the content of the data collection tools and it was stated that the data collected in this study will not be used for any purpose other than the research and will not be shared with another people or institutions. In addition, participants were not forced to participate in the research. Participation in the study was realized on a voluntary basis. Participants completed the scales in an average of 30 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data analysis</head><p>Before analyzing the data obtained from the study, the scales were numbered starting from 1. Then, after coding, the data in the scales were transferred to the computer environment through Microsoft Excel. The following codes were used while transferring the items of the scale to the computer environment: "male -1", "female -2", "1 st grade -1", "2 nd grade -2", "3 rd grade -3", and "4 th grade -4". The answers given to "Environmental Identity Scale" were coded as follows: "Not true at all -1", "Neither true, nor false -4" and "Completely True -7". The answers given to "Environmental Problems Behaviour Scale" were coded as "I don't agree -1", "I'm Neutral -2"and "I Agree -3". Inverse coding (recoding) was performed for some items during analysis.</p><p>The raw data forms prepared in Microsoft Excel program have been converted into data set by using SPSS program. Data cleaning process was performed on these data sets before statistical evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. In this respect, the faulty codes observed in the data set through the frequency tables are cleared by checking raw data forms. After data preparation, SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 24 programs were used for data analysis. In the analysis of the data collected in the study, firstly, the data were tested for normal distribution. For this purpose, skewness and kurtosis coefficients were calculated from the data as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. This table reveals that the skewness coefficients of the scales are between +1 and -1. Accordingly, it can be said that the scores confirm normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. While testing the normality, the closeness of mean, median and mode is also considered to be important. If these values are close to each other, it can be said that the distribution of the data is not too far from normality <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that these values are close to each other for both scales. Considering all the results, it was decided that the research data has normal distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Findings related to environmental identities according to gender</head><p>In the research, it was planned to use independent groups t-test to test whether science teachers' environmental identity differed significantly according to gender, however t-test was not performed because even though normal distribution of the data assumption was met, the homogeneity of variances assumption was not satisfied. The average environmental identity scores of pre-service teachers according to gender is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that female pre-service science teachers' environmental identity average score is higher than males, but this difference is not statistically significant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Findings related to environmental identities according to grade</head><p>One-way ANOVA test was used to analyze whether there are significant differences among environmental identity scores of pre-service teachers according to grade. First of all, normality tests were conducted according to the grade level and it was found that the data has normal distribution. Then, within the one-way ANOVA test, Levene test was performed and "the equivalence of the variances of the groups" was tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. The resultant p value was found to be &gt;0.05. Accordingly, the group variances seem to be equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. The results obtained from the LSD test are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Since p&gt;0.05 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, it was concluded that there is no significant difference among the environmental identity of pre-service teachers according to grade. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Findings related to the behavior towards environment according to gender</head><p>In the research, the differentiation of science teachers' behavior towards environment according to gender was analyzed by independent group t-test. First of all, normality tests were conducted according to gender and it was found that the data is normally distributed. Then the performed Levene test showed that the group variances of male and female students are equal. The results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows that, female students' average behavior towards environment score ( =91.33) is significantly higher than male students ( =87.82). The effect size was calculated as d=0.14, indicating that the impact of gender on the behavior towards environment is low (Green and Salkind, 2005; cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Findings related to the behavior towards environment according to grade</head><p>One-way ANOVA test was used to analyze if there are significant differences among the behaviors of pre-service teachers towards environmental problems according to grade. First of all, normality tests were conducted according to the grade level and it was found that the data has normal distribution. Then, within the one-way ANOVA test, Levene test was performed and "the equivalence of the variances of the groups" was tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. The resultant p value was found to be&gt; 0.05. Accordingly, the group variances seem to be equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. The results obtained by LSD test are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>.</p><p>The critical value in the F distribution table <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> used to interpret the value of F in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> is approximately 2.65. The F value calculated in the study was found to be significant because it was greater than this critical value. In addition, p value was also significant, thus at least two of the grade levels have a significant difference in terms of behavior towards environmental problems. LSD test was used to determine the grade levels whose difference were significant in terms of behavior towards environmental problems. According to this test; It was found that there were significant differences between freshman pre-service teachers' average score of behavior towards environmental problems ( =88.45) and the third grade ( =93.73) and fourth grade ( = 92.33) pre-service teachers' behavior score. The same situation was observed among the second grade pre-service teachers ( =88.57) and third and fourth grade pre-service teachers. The results showed that the behavioral scores for environmental problems were higher in the upper grades.</p><p>The effect of the grade on the behaviors of pre-service teachers towards environmental problems was calculated with the eta-squared coefficient (η2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, which was found to be η 2 =0.06. According to this result, it can be said that the effect of the grade level is moderate (Green and Salkind, 2005; cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">The relationship between environmental identities and behavior towards environmental problems</head><p>In the study, Pearson moment product correlation coefficient was calculated in order to examine the relationship between pre-service science teachers' environmental identity and their behaviors towards environmental problems. The correlation coefficient was found as 0.420, which indicates a moderate relationship between the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Regression related to environmental identity and the behavior towards environmental problems</head><p>In the study, simple linear regression analysis was performed in order to see whether the environmental identity of pre-service science teachers was a significant predictor of their behaviors towards environmental problems. Firstly, the normality of the data was tested and normal distribution was confirmed. Then, regression analysis was performed. The results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. As a result of simple linear regression analysis performed to determine how the environmental identity predicts the behavior of pre-service science teachers towards environmental problems, a significant relationship was found between these two variables (R=0.420; R 2 =0.176). It was found that environmental identity is a significant predictor of pre-service science teachers' behavior towards environmental problems (F(1-213)=45.642; p&lt;0.005). R 2 value showed that 18% of the change in the behavior of pre-service teachers towards environmental problems can be explained by environmental identity. The significance test for the environmental identity showed that this variable was a significant predictor. According to the results of regression analysis, the regression equation is given below. Behavior towards environmental problems = (0.208 x Environmental identity) + 63.583</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Path analysis for the variables of the research</head><p>Previous analysis in the study was reviewed before proposing a path diagram based on the relationship between variables. Then, the diagram was prepared and tested as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. The path diagram prepared and tested in the study is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. In the path analysis, the grade of pre-service teachers was transformed into a two-category representative variable. The coefficients of concordance for the path diagram developed in the study are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>. According to the path diagram and the coefficients of concordance, it was found that the path presented diagram has high adaptability. The total and direct effect values between the variables are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref> shows that being in 3 rd and 4 th grade (β = 0.202, p &lt;0.05) and environmental identity (β = 0.41, p &lt;0.05) predict the behavior towards environmental problems. In addition, it was found that the effect of grade and environmental identity on the behavior towards environmental problems is direct.</p><p>In this research, environmental identity of pre-service science teachers and their behaviors towards environmental problems were examined according to gender and grade. A path diagram was developed by evaluating the relationship between the variables.</p><p>In the study, it was found that female students' average environmental identity score was higher than the average score of males. This gender difference is consistent with previous studies on the subject ISSN: 2252-8822 </p><p>From the environmental identity to the behavior: The status of pre-service science teachers (Esra Kızılay) 277 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40]</ref>. There was no significant difference between pre-service teachers' environmental identity according to grade. It was found that female students' average score of behavior towards environmental problems was significantly higher than the average score of males. In a study conducted by Alnıacık <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41]</ref>, environmentfriendly behaviors of university students were examined. In the study, it was concluded that the female students' environment-friendly behaviors were significantly higher. In a study conducted by Kısoglu, Yildirim, Salman and Sulun <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref>, it was found that female pre-service teachers' average score for environmental problems was higher than the average score of males. In a study in which pre-service teachers' behaviors towards the environment were examined, it was concluded that the average score of the female students was higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref>. In the study of Sahin and Dogu <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>, it was found that female pre-service preschool teachers' behavior scores related to environmental problems were significantly higher than the scores of males. Similar results were obtained for secondary school students. Female students' environmental behavior scores were found to be higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref>. Female students are likely to have higher scores on environmental problems than male students, because women are more sensitive to the environment and give more importance to environmental cleanliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref>. Unlike all these results, Ari <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref> found that male university students 'environmental behavior scores were significantly higher than female students'.</p><p>In the study, it was found that the average behavior scores of pre-service science teachers who attend third and fourth grade were significantly higher than the average scores of the first and second grade students. A similar result was revealed in the study of Kısoglu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref>, in which it was found that the average behavior scores of the fourth-grade pre-service teachers were significantly higher than those of the first-grade. The probable cause of this situation may be the environmental science course included in the third year curriculum of the science education undergraduate program. Students who take environmental courses at the university exhibit more positive behaviors related to the environment than students who do not attend such courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref>.</p><p>In the research, a moderate relationship was revealed between pre-service science teachers' environmental identity and their behaviors towards environmental problems. It was found that pre-service teachers' environmental identity is a significant predictor of their behavior towards environmental problems. It was determined that 18% of the change in pre-service teachers' behaviors towards environmental problems can be explained by their environmental identity. This fact indicates that environmental identity has a significant effect in shaping the behaviors related to environmental problems and it is probably due to the fact that the environment has a different importance in the Turkish culture and the beliefs of the Turks. Indeed, in the studies conducted by Tanik <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref> and Clayton and Kilinc <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, it was found that the environmental identity of pre-service teachers was an important predictor of environment-friendly behaviors. In the research, it was found environmental identity and attending 3 rd and 4 th grade of science education program predicted the behavior towards environmental problems.</p></div>
