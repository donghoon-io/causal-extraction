<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a new sample of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources with radio luminosity below 10 26 W Hz -1 at 1.4 GHz called the low luminosity compact (LLC) objects. The sources have been selected from FIRST survey and observed with MER-LIN at L-band and C-band. The main criterion used for selection was luminosity of the objects and approximately one third of the CSS sources from the new sample have a value of radio luminosity comparable to FR Is. About 80% of the sources have been resolved and about 30% of them have weak extended emission and disturbed structures when compared with the observations of higher luminosity CSS sources. We studied correlation between radio power and linear size, and redshift with a larger sample that included also published samples of compact objects and large scale FR IIs and FR Is. The low luminosity compact objects occupy the space in radio power versus linear size diagram below the main evolutionary path of radio objects. We suggest that many of them might be short-lived objects, and their radio emission may be disrupted several times before becoming FR IIs. We conclude that there exists a large population of short-lived low luminosity compact objects unexplored so far and part of them can be precursors of large scale FR Is.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Radio sources are divided into two distinct morphological groups of objects: FR Is and FR IIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Fanaroff &amp;Riley 1974)</ref>. There is a relatively sharp luminosity boundary between them at low frequency. The nature of the FR-division is still an open issue, as are the details of the evolutionary process in which younger and smaller Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources become large scale radio structures. It is unclear whether FR II objects evolve to become FR Is, or whether a division has already occurred amongst CSS sources and some of these then become FR Is and some FR IIs. A majority of CSS sources known to date have high radio luminosities and, if unbeamed, have FR II structures. It seems reasonable to suspect that some of the CSSs with lower radio luminosity could be the progenitors of less luminous FR I objects.</p><p>The GPS and CSS sources form a well-defined class of compact radio objects and are considered to be entirely contained within the host galaxy. During their evolution the radio jets start to cross the ISM and try to ⋆ E-mail: magda@astro.uni.torun.pl leave the host galaxy. The interaction with the ISM can be very strong in GPS/CSS sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Holt et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Labiano et al. 2005)</ref> and it seems to be a crucial point in the evolution of radio sources. Recently developed models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kaiser &amp; Best 2007)</ref> show that all sources start out with a FR II morphology. As the radio source expands the interaction with the dense environment of the host galaxy can disrupt jets and change their morphology to FR Is or hybrid objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gopal-Krishna &amp; Wiita 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gawroński et al. 2006)</ref>. Some sources with disrupted jets can fade away <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexander 2000)</ref>. Detection of several candidates for dying compact sources supports this view <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Giroletti et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Marecki et al. 2006</ref>). What's more, the activity of compact radio sources can be an episodic event <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Snellen et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marecki et al. 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gugliucci et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. 2006)</ref>, like in the case of large scale radio objects.</p><p>As recently suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Czerny et al. (2009)</ref> there could be a connection between the existence of short-lived compact radio sources and the intermittent activity of the central engine caused by a radiation pressure instability within an accretion disc. According to the authors a radio source powered by a short-lived outburst of the central ac-tivity is not able to escape from the host galaxy unless the active phase lasts longer than ∼10 4 years. It is then likely that among the low luminosity compact (LLC) sources we can find objects affected during their evolution either by a strong interaction with the ISM, which changes their morphology and luminosity, or by the instability of the accretion disc.</p><p>In this paper we present the L-band and C-band MER-LIN observations of 44 low luminosity CSS sources selected from the FIRST survey. This is a new approach since the main criterion used for selection was not flux density but luminosity of the objects. The selection criteria caused that approximately one third of the CSS sources from the new sample have a value of radio luminosity lower than the luminosity boundary found for FR sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Fanaroff &amp;Riley 1974)</ref>, which means that they are compact young sources with luminosities comparable to FR Is (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). The goal of this project is to study the properties of low luminosity compact (LLC) objects and the evolution of the compact object population. Our previous multifrequency observations of CSS sources have shown that some of the smallscale objects can be strong candidates for compact faders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2006)</ref>. This finding supports the idea that there exist a group of short-lived radio objects that has been largely neglected to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SELECTION AND OBSERVATIONS OF A NEW SAMPLE</head><p>Using the final release of FIRST, combined with the GB6 survey at 4.85 GHz we looked for unresolved, isolated sources i.e. more compact than FIRST beam (5. ′′ 4) and surrounded by an empty field (we adopted 1 ′ as a radius of that field). We required that the redshifts of the objects identified with radio sources are known and we extracted them from NED and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Consequently, we were able to impose the low power criterion. The limit on flux density was chosen in order to produce a sample of manageable size, but also to exclude objects with flux densities too low to be detected in snapshot observations. Eventually, the selection criteria were as follows:</p><p>• Low luminosity criterion: L1.4GHz &lt; 10 26 W Hz -1 . (for H0=100 km s -1 Mpc -1 , q0=0.5; in this paper we use another cosmology);</p><p>• Flux density criterion: 70 mJy S1.4GHz 1 Jy; • Spectral index criterion: α 4.85GHz 1.4GHz &gt; 0.7 (S ∝ ν -α ). Finally, the new sample consists of 44 sources (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>The initial survey was undertaken using MERLIN at L-band. Then some of the sources were also observed with MERLIN at C-band. All the L-band snapshot observations were made between December 2006 and May 2007. Additional C-band snapshot observations were made in 2008 and 2009. Each target source together with its associated phase reference sources was observed for ∼60 min including telescope drive times. The preliminary data reduction was made using an AIPS-based PIPELINE procedure developed at JBO. The resulting phase-calibrated images created with PIPELINE were further improved using several cycles of self-calibration and imaging, the final total intensity (I) and polarization intensity (P) images being produced using the task IMAGR. We considered only emission above 3σ noise level, and we blanked out all the points for which observed P &lt; 3σ, to avoid possible mis-use of low signal-to-noise polarization data. The flux densities of the main components of the target sources were then measured, by fitting Guassian models to the components in the image, using task JMFIT (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). For more extended features the flux densities were evaluated by means of IMSTAT. Sub-components are referred to as North (N), South (S), East (E), West (W) and Central (C). When a component is split into more pieces, a digit (1,2, etc.) is added (e.g. N1, N2). The position of the optical counterparts of target sources are marked with a cross in the images and are taken from the SDSS (found within the radius of 10 ′′ from the radio source) or from the literature. The feature in the radio image closest to the cross is indicated as 'C' and treated as probable radio core.</p><p>Based upon available radio images (our MERLIN Lband and C-band observations and other found in the literature), the new sources have been divided into four categories (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). However, for most of the sources described here we have observation only at one frequency and their classification should be treated as the preliminary one (' ?' means the most uncertain classification). 'Single' means the source is a pointlike object unresolved or slightly resolved. 'Core-jet' is a source with a bright central component and a one-or two-sided emission (jets). 'Double-lobed' objects show at least two kinds of morphologies. Some of them consist of two point-like components without a visible radio core in available radio images, whereas the others show a central weak component and distorted extended structure on both sides of it. Many of the double objects also show brightness asymmetry. For some of them (those with probable core detection) we were able to evaluate the flux density ratio, rs, defined to be &gt;1, of the oppositely directed components. The last category, 'other', comprises sources with peculiar morphologies: three objects have distorted radio morphologies, other three have only a single visible lobe, and one object is resolved into four components with high-resolution imaging. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> show images of the sources with resolved structures with the exception of one object (1641+320) which will be described in a separate paper.</p><p>In this paper, we present the analysis of MERLIN radio observations of a new sample of low luminosity CSS sources and the study the correlation between radio power and linear size, and redshift, making use of a larger sample that included also published samples of CSS sources by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fanti et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Marecki et al. (2003a)</ref>. The combined sample of CSS sources we used in our study is gathered in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">A1</ref> (see Appendix). The optical data of the sample of low luminosity CSS sources will be discussed in a forthcoming paper <ref type="bibr">(Kunert-Bajraszewska &amp; Labiano,2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">hereafter Paper II)</ref>.</p><p>Throughout the paper, we assume a cosmology with H0=71 km s -1 Mpc -1 , ΩM =0.27, ΩΛ=0.73.</p></div>

This source has been classified as a possible double object (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The weak component (C) whose position is correlated with the position of the optical counterpart could be a radio core, on opposite sides of which there is emission from the two radio jets/lobes. The flux density ratio, rs of the oppositely directed components E and W amounts to 1.7. 0821+321. This is a double object with two weak radio lobes without evidence of bright hotspots and radio core (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). 0846+017. This is probably a core-jet morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) with the brightest component to be a radio core (C) and a bent radio jet (S1, S2). 0850+024. Compact double object (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The position of the optical counterpart probably indicates the position of the slightly resolved radio core. 0851+024. Compact double object with a symmetric morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). 0854+210. Weak radio galaxy with diffuse morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) also detected in infrared <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Drake et al. 2003)</ref>. The peak of emission in 1.6 GHz MERLIN image is a radio core also visible in 5 GHz MERLIN image (C). 0907+049. This is a double object with the brightest central component (C) probably containing a radio core, on opposite sides of which there is emission from the two radio jets/lobes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).However the polarization is not detected in the southern component, which can be an artifact. The polarized flux density of components C and N amounts to 3 mJy and 6 mJy, respectively. 0914+114. Both 1.6 GHz and 5 GHz MERLIN images show single component. This source has been resolved with VLBI at 2.3 GHz into complex structure consisting of four well separated components <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Xiang et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>0914+504. Quasar with a double morphology and asymmetric polarization. The luminosity of the polarized southern component is lower than the northern one, which can contain a radio core (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The polarized flux density of component S amounts to 4 mJy. 0921+143. The 1.6 GHz MERLIN observation shows a single component which is resolved in 5 GHz MERLIN image into probably core-jet morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). 0923+079. The 1.6 GHz morphology and the position of the optical counterpart suggest there is only a single lobe visible in this source (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). This interpretation is in agreement with 5 GHz MERLIN image. The weak point emission is probably a radio core and the lobe indicated as 'N' in 1.6 GHz image breaks into weak and probably fading components in 5 GHz MERLIN image. 0931+033. The 1.6 GHz MERLIN observation shows a single component which is resolved in 5 GHz MERLIN image into probably core-jet morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). 0942+355. This is a double object with asymmetric emission from two radio lobes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The position of the optical counterpart is correlated with a weak central emission (C). The 5 GHz MERLIN image shows only an emission from the south-eastern radio lobe (E) with a steep spectrum α 5.0 1.6 = 1.1. The flux density ratio, rs of the oppositely directed components E and W amounts to 2.3. 1007+142. Radio galaxy with a double morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Large variations of polarization angle are seen in the southern lobe. The luminosity of the polarized southern component is lower than the northern one. The polarized flux density of component S amounts to 8.5 mJy. 1009+053. Two components with different brightness are visible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Since the position of the optical counterpart is outside the image range it is difficult to interpret the structure. 1037+302.

The 1.6 GHz morphology and the position of the optical counterpart suggest there is only a single lobe visible in this source (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>The new sample of Low Luminosity Compact (LLC) sources that we present in this paper consists of 44 objects. We calculated their basic physical parameters and gathered them in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> we compare their luminosity and linear radio size with the sources from other samples. We used combined sample of CSS sources (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">A1</ref>, Appendix), GPS/high-frequency peaked (HFP) sources from master list created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Labiano et al. (2007)</ref> and the revised 3C sample of FR I and FR II sources (LRL sample, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laing at al. (1983)</ref>) for comparison and statistical study. The Luminosity-Size diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>) shows an evolutionary scheme of radioloud AGNs. The selection criteria used for the new sample resulted in approximately one third of the LLC sources having a value of the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity comparable to FR Is. Their luminosities are definitely lower than CSS sources from last existing samples (crosses in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>). About 70% of the sources from the sample are galaxies and all of them are nearby objects with redshifts in the range 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, although the value of the redshift was not a selection criterion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Characteristic of the groups of objects</head><p>About 80% of the sources in our sample are resolved in available radio maps (this paper and the literature), and at least (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) 39% of the resolved objects are classified as double-lobed, although in this category we do put compact doubles without visible core and those with weak central component detected. A large precentage (∼86%) of these objects show asymmetry in components brightness, but we have measured the flux density ratio only for those with probable core detection (see Section 3). The observed asymmetry among LLC sources is consistent with the previous finding for the CSS source population <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Saikia et al. 2001)</ref> namely that, as a class, the CSSs are more asymmetric than larger radio sources of similar power. For one source, 0942+355, the brightness asymmetry of the components (probably radio lobes) is also visible in 5 GHz image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The 1037+302 has already been observed and investigated at higher frequencies with the VLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Giroletti et al. 2005)</ref>. The very weak peak of emission visible in our 1.6 GHz MERLIN image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), well correlated with the position of the optical counterpart, appeared to be a very weak radio core at 22 GHz with VLA. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Giroletti et al. (2005)</ref> this source will evolve to FR I. Two of the sources classified as double (0821+321, 1558+536) have breaking up structures without obvious signs of activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). About 70 % of the total flux density is missing in the MERLIN Lband image of weak 1558+536, suggesting that the diffuse emission is resolved in our observations.</p><p>We have detected polarization for some of the double sources (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These are doubles without a visible radio core or a very weak one (0914+504, 1007+142, 1053+505, 1542+390). The flux density and luminosity of the polarized component are lower than those of the second component (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Again there is visible asymmetry here, which can be explained in the terms of interaction of the source with an asymmetric medium in the central regions of the host elliptical galaxy. On the contrary to large radio objects, in GPS/CSS sources, the jet is still crossing the ISM and the interaction with the environment can be very strong. Observations of the ionized gas in GPS and CSS sources show the presence of such interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Holt et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Labiano et al. 2005</ref>). The interactions with the ISM can be confirmed also by complicated structure of 1543+465 and twisted jets in 0846+017 and 1154+435 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>Among the LLC sources classified as 'others' we have identified so called 'single-lobed' objects: 0923+079, 1156+470 and 1550+444, based on their radio morphology and position of the optical counterpart (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). In the case of two sources (0923+079, 1156+470) about 60 % of the total flux density is missing in our MERLIN observations, which may suggest that they indeed possess another component, but too weak and extended to be detected in a snapshot mode with MERLIN. The 5 GHz MERLIN observations made for all three sources revealed, in two cases (0923+079, 1156+470), very weak central emission which is probably radio core, and breaking up, fading radio lobe in all cases. This kind of objects have been already observed in one of the previous samples of CSS sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Marecki et al. 2003a)</ref>, and amongst large-scale sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Subrahmanyan et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The last three objects belong to the category 'others' we labelled as the 'interacting systems', and these are: the two galaxy pairs (0854+210, 1506+345), and a very compact quasar binary (1641+320) which will be discussed in detail in a separate paper (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). It has to be noted here that interpretation of 0854+210 as a galaxy pair has not been confirmed yet by detailed optical study. Two of these sources -0854+210 and 1506+345 -belong to group of radioexcess IRAS galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Drake et al. 2003)</ref>. The radio powers of compact radio-excess galaxies are generally lower than the well known CSS objects, with a median of ∼ 10 24.5 W Hz -1 at 5 GHz, and the lower jet energy fluxes are responsible for that <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Drake et al. 2003)</ref>. Also their morphologies do not resemble typical CSS/GPS sources with symmetric double lobes. They rather appear to be highly disrupted which is consistent in all three objects observed by us. 0854+210 has an extended weak emission indicating a trace of previous activity, and 1506+345 has a complex 5 GHz morphology which is probably a consequence of galaxy-galaxy interactions. The galaxy pair 1506+345 has been also observed in a CO line survey made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mazzarella et al. (1993)</ref>, which revealed that both components of this interacting pair contain ∼ 10 10 M⊙ of molecular gas each. According to the authors what we observe here is a colliding disc galaxies which will evolve into gas-rich galaxy. A young phase of radio activity has been ignited here.</p><p>Summing up we have observed four main categories of radio morphology (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) among LLC sources and the most interesting cases among them have been described above. It is difficult to compare radio morphologies of LLC sources with those observed in previous samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fanti et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Marecki et al. 2003a</ref>) because of different observing frequencies and resolutions. However, what we can confirm is that the fraction of sources with complex morphologies (breaking up structures and with single lobe) is higher than that reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fanti et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Marecki et al. (2003a)</ref>. We suggest in section 4.2 that many of them can be interpreted as short-lived objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evolution of CSS sources</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref> shows a full range of luminosity and size covered by radio sources and can be used to study the radio source evolution. We propose an evolutionary scheme that is based on these observed parameters in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. The flattening of the slope at small size visible on the diagram is real and has been first reported by O'Dea &amp; Baum (1997) suggesting different evolution and excess of compact objects comparing to the large scale radio sources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Snellen et al. (2000)</ref> discussed the evolutionary scheme of radio sources and concluded that the radio luminosities of GPS sources increase as they evolve, reach a maximum in the CSS phase and then gradually decrease as these objects grow further to become FR II/FR I sources. However, to match observations, the radio jets of the young sources must slow down as they cross the host ISM and dim faster than predicted. Recently de Vries et al. <ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref> showed that indeed the expansion speed of GPS radio sources is correlated with their radio luminosity and is lower for less powerful young radio sources. Most of the GPS and CSS sources known so far are powerful objects and the clue to solve the evolution puzzle can be in the analysis of less powerful compact sources.</p><p>According to the latest theoretical predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kaiser &amp; Best 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Czerny et al. 2009</ref>) and observational facts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gugliucci et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. 2006)</ref> the situation in the group of young radio objects can be complicated. The episodic nature of the radio activity is a fact among large scale objects where we observe two or more of active periods in the radio images. This is still debated for young objects, as is the nature of the mechanism causing it. Based on our latest observations of LLC sample we suggest we should treat the 'young source phase' of the evolution of radio object as the one which determines its further evolution. Different mechanisms and interactions may play an important role here. The most likely mechanism to produce these effects is interaction of the radio source with the host environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labiano et al. (2009)</ref> found that the GPS and CSS sources (galaxies and quasars) show a strong correlation between [O III]λ5007 line luminosity and size of the radio source suggesting a possible deceleration in the jet as it crosses the host ISM. However this correlation may not be present in fainter radio sources where the radio and [O III]λ5007 can be produced in a different way (Paper II). There are indications <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tasse et al. 2008</ref>), based on the environmental studies of radio sources at moderate redshifts (z∼ 0.5-1), that low-luminosity radio AGNs lie in denser environments than the powerful objects, have lower stellar masses and show excess mid-IR emission consistent with a hidden radiatively efficient active nucleus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tasse et al. (2008)</ref> also argue that the low luminosity radio activity is associated with the re-fuelling of massive black holes. Recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Czerny et al. (2009)</ref> discussed mechanism of instabilities in the accretion flow suggesting that the duration of the active phase should be longer than 10 4 years to enable the young source to escape from the host galaxy. For the shorter active phase the radio source will be confined within the host galaxy and such short outbursts may occur many times. We have presented this scenario on the scheme of the radio source evolution as the two-sided arrows (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) and labeled these sources as short-lived objects. To this group of objects belong observed by us CSSs with weak breaking up structures, without compact hotspots or jets and core visible, which means compact but already fading objects that will not evolve into large scale sources in this phase of activity. We interpret some double sources (0821+321, 1558+536) and 'single-lobed' objects (0923+079, 1156+470, 1550+444) observed in LLC sample as compact faders. We suggest that these double objects from our sample with brightness and polarization asymmetry may undergo disturbed evolution and starting to fade away as single-lobed objects or to become FR Is or hybrids. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexander (2000)</ref> sources with disrupted jets are not expected to evolve into FR I objects, but fade so strongly that they become virtually undetectable. Also sources we called 'interacting systems' (galaxy pairs and quasar binaries) can be interpreted as short-lived objects. The galaxy-ISM interactions observed in these double systems can change the direction of the jets and disturb the environment fuelling the black hole and consequently prevent the growing of the radio structure. As an effect of such interactions we observe complicated radio structures consisting of weak fading emission together with current phase and direction of the activity. Two of the weak 'interacting systems' (0854+210 and 1506+345) are radio-excess IRAS galaxies. As has been discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Drake et al. (2003)</ref> the radio-excess sources, with the radio powers in general lower than the well known CSS objects, are not expected to evolve in the same manner as CSS/GPS sources, but rather fade even further to return to their place among the radio-quiet FIR-luminous AGNs.</p><p>The evolutionary path for powerful compact objects is the one established so far namely that the CSS sources evolve to become FR IIs.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Snellen et al. (2000)</ref> and also visible in our plot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>), the smallest radio objects (GPS/HFP sources) should increase their luminosity and size during the evolution. However in the evolutionary scheme (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) we put a question mark while illustrating this path. We have noticed that most of the GPS/HFP sources are already as bright as CSSs and FR IIs, and these small objects with lower luminosity can either follow the predicted path or fade earlier becoming weak CSS object.</p><p>Another question mark in the evolutionary scheme (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) concerns the rare class of radio sources -hybrids, which evolutionary path is suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kaiser &amp; Best (2007)</ref>. However, recent results based on Chandra observations show that hybrid sources which show broad-line optical spectra have X-ray properties comparable with those of FR IIs radio galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Miller et al. 2009)</ref>. It is possible that in the case of these rare objects the transition from FR IItype jet to FR I-type plum structure takes place at the later stages of evolution due to interaction with a dense and nonhomogeneous intergalactic medium. Numerical works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Meliani et al. 2008)</ref> suggest that a powerful FR II-type jet can be decelerated by a high density medium and transform to FR I-type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SUMMARY</head><p>In this paper, we have presented results from MERLIN Lband and C-band observations of a new sample of low luminosity compact sources. Most of the sources have been resolved showing complex, asymmetric radio morphologies suggesting presence of dense environment and jet-ISM interactions. We suggest that some of the sources with the breaking up structures or one-sided morphology are candidates for compact faders. In this case the fraction of faders is higher (∼15%) than that reported in CSS samples from B3-VLA and FIRST catalogues (∼4%). We suspect we can increase the number of these sources by a factor of 2 or even 3, by extending the studies to lower frequencies and luminosities.</p><p>We studied correlation between radio power and linear size, and redshift with a larger sample that included also published samples of compact objects and large scale FR IIs and FR Is. The low luminosity compact objects occupy the space in radio power versus linear size diagram below the main evolutionary path of radio objects. We conclude that many of them can be short-lived objects, at least in the current phase of evolution. These undergo disrupted evolution many times as they are be able to escape the host galaxy and evolve to FR IIs. The presented here analysis of the radio properties of LLC sources and also analysis of their spectroscopic features which will be discussed in a second paper of the series indicate that most of them will evolve finally to FR II. However, we suggest that there exists a much larger population of short-lived low luminosity compact objects un-explored so far and among them we can find precursors of large scale FR Is. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
