<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The most important role and function of teacher performance is as an educator and teaching, that every teacher must have emotional stability, want to advance students, be realistic, honest and open as well as sensitive to developments, especially educational innovation. To achieve this, teachers must have broad knowledge, master various types of learning, master educational theory and practice, and master curriculum and learning methodologies. Therefore, the performance of a teacher can be seen from the work achievements obtained by a teacher, how a teacher carries out tasks in each learning and evaluates learning outcomes and provides follow-up of learning evaluations, and work results obtained by a teacher (Hepni Albuni, Aslamiah, 2022; Martini, Karyono Ibnu Ahmad, 2022; Noviecka Wieyanthi, Wahyu, 2022; Rudiansyah, Wahyu, 2022; Supiansyah, Ahmad Suriansyah, 2022; Suratman, Wahyu, 2022; Syarifuddin A, Suriansyah, A, 2022).</p><p>Teacher performance is the teacher's ability and effort to carry out learning tasks as well as possible in planning teaching programs, implementing learning activities and evaluating learning outcomes. According to the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 20 of 2003 concerning the National Education System in Article 39 paragraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> it is explained that Educators are professionals tasked with planning and implementing the learning process, assessing learning outcomes, conducting mentoring and training, and conducting research and community service, especially for educators in tertiary institutions.</p><p>Thus, the teacher's performance can be interpreted as the result of work in quality and quantity achieved by a teacher concerned in carrying out his duties in the learning process in accordance with the responsibilities given to him by the organization. Teacher performance is the result of the multiplication of motivation, ability and tasks that have been carried out.</p><p>From the formulation regarding teacher performance above, it can be stated that the socio-economic relationship between teachers and performance means that with the existence of wealth, the teacher is capable of meeting daily needs, ranging from basic needs to tertiary needs. With the wealth owned and the ability to meet needs, it is a very decisive aspect for the performance of the teacher concerned. The relationship between teacher motivation and performance is that teacher work motivation acts as a driving force for teachers to carry out their duties properly and achieve maximum results for their work organization. The role of teacher motivation, both internal and external, is very important for the creation of professional teachers. Therefore, it is this motivation that determines the behavior of people to work, or in other words that behavior is the simplest reflection of a person's motivation to be involved in working hard which ultimately improves performance. While the relationship between job satisfaction and teacher performance is that job satisfaction can determine high or low levels of teacher performance. The existence of a level of teacher job satisfaction is expected to improve the teacher's performance so that it can achieve the goals expected by the organization in obtaining good work results in producing good productivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>The research uses quantitative research with correlation analysis, which is a study that aims to describe and look for the relationship of several existing study variables, without carrying out the steps as contained in the initial research. Therefore, this study can be categorized as a descriptive study, namely trying to explain variables which also aims to describe the closeness of the relationship between one variable and another between variables and one criterion variable. This study uses several variables, namely Social Economy (X1) Motivation (X2) independent variable, Job Satisfaction (Z) intervening variable and Teacher Performance (Y) as the dependent variable, this study uses correlational techniques. What is meant by correlation is a study that describes the relationship between two or more variables. This correlation study determines the extent of the relationship between the two variables. In this case, what is studied is the relationship between the socio-economics of PAUD educators (X1) and job satisfaction (Z), the relationship between motivation (X2) and job satisfaction (Z). the relationship between socio-economic (X1) and performance (Y); the relationship between motivation (X2) and performance (Y); the relationship between job satisfaction (Z) and performance (Y); the relationship between socio-economic PAUD educators (X1) and performance (Y) through job satisfaction (Z); the relationship between motivation (X2) and performance (Y) through job satisfaction (Z). While the research is more focused on analyzing whether there is a significant relationship between socio-economic variables and motivation variables with teacher performance variables through the PAUD teacher job satisfaction variable in Cluster 4 Sedap Malam, Tanah Bumbu district.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Socio-Economic Relations with the Performance of Cluster 4 Early Childhood Education Teachers in Tanah Bumbu</head><p>Regency From the results of hypothesis testing the relationship between socio-economic variables and teacher performance variables stated that socio-economic does not have a significant relationship to teacher performance. While the socio-economic relationship with teacher performance is 0.321 or classified as low positive. From the study, it was found that a direct correlation between socioeconomic variables and teacher performance variables was 0.321 or classified as weak, covered by a direct correlation between socio-economic variables and teacher satisfaction variables of 0.672 or classified as strong. This can be interpreted that the teacher's socio-economic does not directly affect teacher performance, but there are other things that affect teacher performance, namely performance standards related to teacher quality in carrying out tasks such as: working with students individually, preparation and lesson planning, utilization of learning media, engaging students in a variety of learning experiences, and active leadership. The results of this study reinforce the results of previous studies found that teacher performance is influenced by a number of variables such as socioeconomic, salary, leadership motivation, and abilities. <ref type="bibr">(Hendiarto,</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Relationship between Motivation and the Performance of Cluster 4 Early Childhood Education Teachers in Tanah</head><p>Bumbu Regency. From the results of hypothesis testing the relationship between work motivation and teacher performance variables which state that work motivation has no significant relationship with teacher performance. While the relationship between motivation and teacher performance is 0.076 or classified as very low positive. From this study, it was found that the direct correlation between motivational variables and teacher performance variables was covered by a direct correlation between motivational variables and teacher satisfaction variables. It can be interpreted that teacher motivation does not directly affect teacher performance, but there are other things that affect teacher performance, namely performance standards related to teacher quality in carrying out tasks such as: working with students individually, preparation and planning of lessons, utilization of learning media, engaging students in a variety of learning experiences, and active leadership. The results of this study reinforce the results of previous studies found that there is relationship between motivation and the performance (Ahmadiyanto, Ahmad Suriansyah, 2022; Haji Munirah, Aslamiah, 2022).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Relationship between Job Satisfaction and the Performance of Cluster 4 Early Childhood Education Teachers in</head><p>Tanah Bumbu Regency. From the results of hypothesis testing the relationship between job satisfaction and teacher performance variables which state that job satisfaction has a significant relationship with teacher performance. While the relationship between job satisfaction and teacher performance is 0.739 or classified as high positive.</p><p>The relationship between the two variables can be explained that employee job satisfaction is a phenomenon that needs to be observed by organizational leaders. Employee job satisfaction is closely related to work productivity and organizational performance. Job satisfaction is an emotional attitude or feeling of fun and loving work. This attitude is reflected by work morale, discipline and work performance. Job satisfaction is enjoyed at work, outside of work, and a combination of both inside and outside of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hasibuan, 2017)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Robbins (2009)</ref> job satisfaction is influenced by many factors, namely: challenging jobs, reward systems, working environment conditions, interpersonal relationships and well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Socio-Economic Relations with Job Satisfaction of Cluster 4 Early Childhood Education Teachers in Tanah Bumbu</head><p>Regency From the results of hypothesis testing the relationship between socio-economic variables and job satisfaction variables which state that socio-economic has a significant relationship to job satisfaction. While the socio-economic relationship with job satisfaction is 0.672 or classified as high positive. From the relationship between the two variables, it can be interpreted that the teacher's socio-economic status is the wealth that is owned, seen from the ability to meet daily needs, starting from basic needs to tertiary needs. Teachers who have wealth can buy several items that are classified as luxury, for example cars, luxury houses, branded clothes and others. With the wealth owned and the ability to meet needs, it is an aspect that is very decisive for the job satisfaction of the teacher concerned. Given the conditions and ability to meet various needs will lead to certain pleasures, then these fun things will support the level of job satisfaction of the teacher concerned. Then the teacher's job satisfaction can increase the productivity of the teacher concerned or the work organization as a whole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The Relationship between Motivation and Job Satisfaction of PAUD Cluster 4 Sedap Malam Teachers in Tanah Bumbu</head><p>Regency. From the results of hypothesis testing the relationship between work motivation and job satisfaction variables which state that work motivation has a significant relationship with teacher job satisfaction. Meanwhile, the relationship between work motivation and teacher job satisfaction is 0.843 or very high positive.</p><p>From the relationship between the two variables, it can be interpreted that one of the factors that influence teacher loyalty is their work motivation. Everyone in carrying out a certain action must be driven by certain motives, as well as teachers who work to provide learning will have a certain loyalty to the school or students. Work motivation usually arises because of unmet needs, goals to be achieved, or the desired expectations. Motivation is a combination of psychological forces that are so complex in every person. Each individual has his own motivation which may be different. As explained by <ref type="bibr">Wibowo (2015: 111)</ref>, motivation is an encouragement to act on a series of human behavior processes by considering direction, intensity, and persistence in achieving goals. While the elements contained in motivation include elements of arousing, directing, maintaining, showing intensity, being continuous and having a purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Socio-Economic Relations with Teacher Performance Through Job Satisfaction of Cluster 4 PAUD Early Childhood</head><p>Education Teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency. From the results of hypothesis testing to find out the relationship through a mediating variable is significantly capable of being a mediator in the relationship. From testing the relationship of the socio-economic variable (X1) through the job satisfaction variable (Z) with the teacher performance variable (Y): it is known that the direct relationship given by the socio-economic variable (X1) with the teacher performance variable (Y) is 0.321. Meanwhile, the indirect relationship between the socioeconomic variable (X1) through the job satisfaction variable (Z) and the teacher performance variable (Y) is the multiplication of the beta value of X1 to Z with the value of beta Z to Y, namely: 0.672 x 0.739 = 0.497. Then the total relationship given the socioeconomic variable (X1) with the teacher performance variable (Y) is a direct relationship plus an indirect relationship, namely: 0.321 + 0.497= 0.818. Based on the calculation results above, it is known that the value of the direct relationship is 0.321 and the indirect relationship is 0.497 which means that the value of the direct relationship is smaller than the indirect relationship. on teacher performance variable (Y). From the relationship between socio-economic variables and teacher performance, it can be interpreted that the teacher's socio-economic status is the wealth possessed by the ability to meet daily needs, ranging from basic needs to tertiary needs. Teachers who have wealth can buy several items that are classified as luxury, for example cars, luxury houses, branded clothes and others. With the wealth owned and the ability to meet needs, it is a very decisive aspect for the job satisfaction of the teacher concerned. Given the conditions and ability to meet various needs will lead to pleasure, then fun things will support the level of teacher job satisfaction. Then the teacher's job satisfaction can and will increase the productivity of the teacher concerned or the work organization as a whole. Given that job satisfaction is influenced by many factors, namely: challenging jobs, reward systems, working environment conditions, interpersonal relationships and well-being. Therefore, job satisfaction will significantly and positively support teacher productivity which is closely related to the teacher's performance and overall organizational performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. The Relationship between Motivation and Teacher Performance through Job Satisfaction of Cluster 4 PAUD Teachers</head><p>in Sedap Malam, Tanah Bumbu Regency From the results of the hypothesis test to determine the relationship between the motivation variable (X2) through the job satisfaction variable (Z) on the teacher performance variable Y: it is known that the direct relationship given by the motivation variable (X2) with the teacher performance variable (Y) is 0.076. Meanwhile, the indirect relationship between the motivation variable (X2) through the job satisfaction variable (Z) and the teacher performance variable (Y) is the multiplication of the beta</p><p>The Relationship Between Socio-Economy, Motivation and Performance through Job Satisfaction of Early Childhood Teachers in Cluster 4 Sedap Malam, Tanah Bumbu Regency value of X1 to Z and the value of beta Z to Y, namely: 0.843 x 0.739 = 0.623. Then the total relationship given by the motivation variable (X2) with the teacher performance variable (Y) is a direct relationship plus an indirect relationship, namely: 0.076 + 0.623 = 0.699. Based on the results of the calculation above, it is known that the value of the direct relationship is 0.076 and the indirect relationship is 0.699 which means that the value of the direct relationship is smaller than the indirect relationship. These results show directly that the motivation variable (X2) through the job satisfaction variable (Z) has a relationship significantly with teacher performance (Y).</p><p>In the relationship between motivation and teacher performance, it can be explained that the two things related to performance are the willingness or motivation of the teacher to work, which causes the teacher's effort and the teacher's ability to carry out his work. According to Gomez (2013) that performance is a function of motivation and ability or it can be written by the formula P = f (M x A) where P = performance/performance, m = motivation/motivation, a = ability/ability. Ability is inherent in a person and is innate and manifested in his actions at work, while motivation is a very important aspect to drive one's creativity and ability to do a job, and always be enthusiastic in carrying out the work. So motivation in this case is actually a response to an action. Motivation arises from within humans because of the urge to have an element of a goal. This goal concerns the matter of need, it can be said that there will be no motivation if there is no felt need. In this case, humans tend to behave negatively when they are dissatisfied with work, and tend to behave positively when they are satisfied with their work.</p><p>From some of the descriptions that have been described, it can be concluded that teachers are able to do the job and want to achieve maximum results in their work. The realization of maximum performance, it takes a boost to bring up the will and enthusiasm for work, namely with motivation. Motivation serves to stimulate the teacher's ability so that maximum performance results will be created.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded as follows: (1) there was no significant relationship between the socioeconomics of teachers and the performance of Cluster 4 Sedap Malam PAUD teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency with a weak positive correlation; (2) There is no significant relationship between work motivation and the performance of Cluster 4 Sedap Malam PAUD teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency with a very weak positive correlation; (3) There is a significant relationship between teacher job satisfaction and the performance of Cluster 4 Sedap Malam PAUD teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency with a strong positive correlation; (4) There is a significant relationship between teacher socio-economic and job satisfaction of Cluster 4 Sedap Malam PAUD teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency with a strong positive correlation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> There is a significant relationship between work motivation and job satisfaction of Cluster 4 Sedap Malam PAUD teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency with a very strong positive correlation; (6) Significant job satisfaction contributes to strengthening socio-economic relations with the performance of Cluster 4 Early Childhood Education teachers in Tanah Bumbu Regency; and (7) significant job satisfaction participates in strengthening the relationship between work motivation and the performance of Cluster 4 PAUD teachers in Sedap Malam, Tanah Bumbu Regency.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Socio-Economy, Motivation and Performance through Job Satisfaction of Early Childhood Teachers in Cluster 4 Sedap Malam, Tanah Bumbu Regency</figDesc></figure>
