<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The causal structure of a unitary transformation is the set of relations of possible influence between any input subsystem and any output subsystem. We study whether such causal structure can be understood in terms of compositional structure of the unitary. Given a quantum circuit with no path from input system A to output system B, system A cannot influence system B. Conversely, given a unitary U with a no-influence relation from input A to output B, it follows from [B. Schumacher and M. D. Westmoreland, Quantum Information Processing 4 no. 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Feb, 2005)</ref>] that there exists a circuit decomposition of U with no path from A to B. However, as we argue, there are unitaries for which there does not exist a circuit decomposition that makes all causal constraints evident simultaneously. To address this, we introduce a new formalism of 'extended circuit diagrams', which goes beyond what is expressible with quantum circuits, with the core new feature being the ability to represent direct sum structures in addition to sequential and tensor product composition. A causally faithful extended circuit decomposition, representing a unitary U , is then one for which there is a path from an input A to an output B if and only if there actually is influence from A to B in U . We derive causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for a large class of unitaries, where in each case, the decomposition is implied by the unitary's respective causal structure. We hypothesize that every finite-dimensional unitary transformation has a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition.</p></div>

Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> considers bipartite channels acting on systems A and B, and shows, amongst other things, that if the channel allows signalling from A to B, but not from B to A, then it can be implemented in a manner that involves communication only from A to B. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> studies tripartite unitaries in which one of the inputs cannot signal to one of the outputs, and shows that any such unitary can be written as a suitable composition of two bipartite unitaries. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> presents a representation theorem in a similar spirit to that of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for unitary transformations involving an arbitrary number of systems, with arbitrary signalling constraints. Further results along these lines are obtained in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. One important application is to quantum cellular automata, for which see Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the category-theoretic approach to quantum theory, focusing on the compositional structure of quantum processes, has led to the development of a diagrammatic representation of the theory that is a useful tool for reasoning about quantum systemssee, e.g., Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and references therein. Although this research has been far from independent from research into quantum causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, a rigorous understanding of the relation between causal structure and compositional structure of quantum processes is missing -can the former be understood in terms of the latter?</p><p>The present work aims to answer this question. In common with the approach to quantum causal models described in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, we take causal relationships in quantum theory ultimately to be understood in terms of unitary transformations. Given a unitary transformation from a number of input quantum systems to a number of output quantum systems, the unitary's causal structure is determined by the subset of input systems that can influence each output system. Suppose that a unitary transformation U has a representation as a quantum circuit diagram, that is, U is equivalent to the composition of other unitary transformations, in sequence and in tensor product. If there is no path from input system A to output system B in the circuit diagram, then there is no influence from A to B in U -the no-influence relation thereby becomes graphically evident in the circuit representation of U . Conversely, the result of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> implies that, given a unitary U , if A does not influence B, then there always exists a circuit decomposition of U which makes that particular no-influence relation graphically evident through the absence of a corresponding path from A to B. However, as we show in Sec. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>, not all unitaries allow for a circuit decomposition that simultaneously makes all no-influence relations evident. Thus, circuit diagrams built from sequential and tensor product composition of unitary transformations do not suffice to understand causal structure.</p><p>We therefore introduce an extension to the standard formalism of quantum circuit diagrams. The core new feature is the ability to represent direct sum structures in addition to sequential and tensor product composition. A causally faithful extended circuit decomposition, representing a unitary U , is then one for which there is a path from an input A to an output B if and only if there actually is influence from A to B in U . Secs. 4, 5, and 6 introduce extended circuit diagrams, and provide representation theorems for a wide range of unitaries, where in each case, the representation implies that any unitary with a given causal structure can be decomposed into a causally faithful extended circuit diagram. Specifically, referring to a unitary transformation with n input and k output subsystems as being of type (n, k), we provide causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for all unitaries of type (n, k) with n ≤ 3, all of type (n, k) with k ≤ 3, and for a range of type <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> cases. We hypothesise that any (finite-dimensional) type (n, k) unitary transformation can be represented with a causally faithful extended circuit diagram. However, we do not establish this claim in general, and we list those type <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> cases that remain unsolved.</p><p>Finally, in Sec. 7, we discuss a number of related aspects, including reasons for restricting the study to unitary transformations (rather than generic quantum channels), the fact that the dimensions of input and output systems restrict the permissible causal structures that a unitary can have, and the application of the results to broken unitary circuits (or unitary combs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Causal structure of unitary transformations</head><p>The Hilbert space of a quantum system A is denoted H A , and assumed throughout to be of finite dimension d A . If S is a set of quantum systems then H S := S i ∈S H S i .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Decompositions using circuit diagrams</head><p>If, for a given unitary U , an input system A cannot influence output system B, it is natural to think that this must have consequences in terms of the compositional structure of U . This section presents a few known examples where this is indeed the case, and raises the question of whether it is always the case. First, consider U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">H A 1 ⊗ H A 2 → H B 1 ⊗ H B 2 , such that A 1 B 2 and A 2 B 1 . The- orem 1 gives ρ U B 1 B 2 |A 1 A 2 = ρ B 1 |A 1 ρ B 2 |A 2 , which (recalling our convention for interpreting products of operators) is equal to ρ B 1 |A 1 ⊗ ρ B 2 |A 2 .</formula><p>Seeing as the overall channel is unitary, and of product form, the two channels represented by ρ B 1 |A 1 and ρ B 2 |A 2 have to be unitary channels themselves. Hence U = V ⊗ W for some unitaries V :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">H A 1 → H B 1 and W : H A 2 → H B 2 (</formula><p>the same conclusion appears via different arguments in, e.g., Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>). This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">3</ref>. The quantum circuit on the right hand side makes both causal constraints graphically evident through the absence of a path from A 1 to B 2 and also from</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A 2 to B 1 . U B1 B2 A1 A2 = V W B1 B2 A1 A2 Figure 3: Factorisation of unitary U that is implied by A 1 B 2 ∧ A 2 B 1 (indicated as red dashed arrows).</formula><p>The following result of Schumacher and Westmoreland, Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, concerns tripartite unitaries and is in a similar spirit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Theorem 2 [24] 2 : Let U : H A 1 ⊗H A 2 ⊗H A 3 → H B 1 ⊗H B 2 ⊗H B 3 be a unitary. If A 1 B 3 , then there exist unitaries V : H A 2 ⊗ H A 3 → H X ⊗ H B 3 and W : H A 1 ⊗ H X → H B 1 ⊗ H B 2 such that U = (W ⊗ 1 B 3 )(1 A 1 ⊗ V ).</formula><p>This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>. Again, the causal constraint satisfied by U , A 1 B 3 , is evident in the decomposed circuit form, in this case through the absence of a path from the input A 1 to the output B 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. A similar result obviously holds for the case where A 3 B 1 , as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>. Theorem 2 immediately yields another result for bipartite unitaries, obtained by taking A 2 and B 2 to be trivial (i.e., one-dimensional) systems. Consider U : Each of the examples discussed so far has the feature that if the assumed causal constraints are the only ones that the respective unitary transformation satisfies, then the causal structure of the unitary transformation is made explicit in a circuit diagram, such that in the diagram, there is a path from a given input to a given output if and only if that input has a causal influence on that output. This raises the question of whether any unitary transformation admits a circuit diagram that makes the causal structure explicit in the same way. Unfortunately, things are not so simple. Consider a tripartite unitary U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">U B 1 B 2 B 3 A 1 A 2 A 3 = W V B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3 (a) U B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3 = W V B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3 (b)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">H A 1 ⊗ H A 2 → H B 1 ⊗ H B 2 , and suppose that A 1 B 2 . Then U = (W ⊗ 1 B 2 )(1 A 1 ⊗ V ) for some appropriate unitaries V : H A 2 → H X ⊗ H B 2 and W : H A 1 ⊗ H X → H B 1 . This is illustrated in Fig. 5a. Again, the circuit diagram makes the causal constraint, A 1 B 2 , evident. U B 1 B 2 A 1 A 2 = W V B1 B2 A1 A2 (a) U B 1 B 2 A 1 A 2 = W V B1 B2 A1 A2 (b)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">H A 1 ⊗ H A 2 ⊗ H A 3 → H B 1 ⊗ H B 2 ⊗ H B 3 such that both constraints A 1 B 3 and A 3 B 1 hold simultaneously.</formula><p>There is a circuit diagram with the desired connectivity, namely that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">S T V W B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Unitary circuit diagram, with the feature that the corresponding unitary transformation satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A 1 B 3 ∧ A 3 B 1 .</formula><p>This time, however, it is not the case that all unitaries satisfying A 1 B 3 and A 3 B 1 have a decomposition of the form of the circuit in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The general reason for this is that if A 2 is a prime dimensional system, then there is no decomposition of H A 2 into two non-trivial factors, yet this would be necessary for A 2 to influence both of B 1 and B 3 in the circuit of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. An explicit counterexample is provided by a unitary transformation consisting of a sequence of two CNOT gates, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Circuit diagrams, therefore, do not in general suffice to express simultaneously all causal constraints of a unitary transformation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">U B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3 = B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3 = B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What do the wires represent?</head><p>A wire without an index represents a Hilbert space, as in the first example of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, and as usual in quantum circuit diagrams. A wire with an index, or in general a tuple of indices, next to it is associated with a family of Hilbert spaces, parametrized by that tuple of indices. For the set in which an index i takes values, we use the corresponding capital letter, i.e., i ∈ I. In a tuple of indices like (i, j i ), we allow an index j i ∈ J i to take values in a set that is itself parametrized by i ∈ I, and refer to this as 'nesting of indices'. Explicit labels for the Hilbert spaces attached to internal wires are typically suppressed, leaving only the indices. They are included in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10b</ref> for the purpose of this exposition. The wire going from the circle S to the circle U ik , for example, carries the tuple (i, k), and represents the family of Hilbert spaces {H X (1) ik } i∈I,k∈K . This paper considers only diagrams in which open in-or outgoing wires do not carry indices (with the discussion in App. A.10 being the only exception). Reading an extended circuit diagram bottom up, indices 'go in loops', introduced by a 'source' circle, such as S for the indices i and k, and disappear in a 'sink' circle, such as F for k.</p><p>What type is associated with a slice through the diagram?</p><p>The overall Hilbert space associated with a slice through the diagram, can be described as follows. Consider the collection of indices carried by wires crossed by the slice, where each index appears only once in the collection, even if it appears on several wires. For a given assignment of values to the indices in the collection, each wire is associated with the corresponding Hilbert space in the family of Hilbert spaces carried by that wire. For each assignment of values to the indices in the collection, form the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces associated with the wires. The overall Hilbert space associated with the slice is the direct sum, over all value assignments to indices in the collection, of the tensor product Hilbert space associated with each value assignment.</p><p>The slices in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10b</ref>, for example, are associated with the following Hilbert spaces:</p><p>(1) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">H A 1 ⊗ H A 2 ⊗ i∈I,k∈K H X (1) ik ⊗ H X (2) ik ⊗ H X (3) i ⊗ H A 4 ⊗ H A 5 ⊗ H A 6<label>(7)</label></formula><p>(2) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">H A 1 ⊗ i∈I,k∈K H X (1) ik ⊗ H A 2 ⊗ H X (2) ik ⊗ H A 4 ⊗ j i ∈J i H M L ij i ⊗ H M R ij i ⊗ H A 6<label>(8)</label></formula><p>(3) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">H B 1 ⊗ k∈K H Y L k ⊗ H Y R k ⊗ i∈I H Z (1) i ⊗ H Z (2) i ⊗ H Z (3) i ⊗ H B 4 ⊗ H B 5<label>(9)</label></formula><p>From now on, where there is no ambiguity, we will omit the index set I and just write i .</p></div>

This section presents a variety of cases for which we can show that any unitary transformation with a given causal structure can be represented with a causally faithful extended circuit diagram. Let a unitary of type (n, k) be a unitary transformation with n input and k output subsystems. The causal structure of a unitary of type (n, k) consists of a specification of k subsets of the inputs, namely the parental set P a(B j ) for each output B j . Recall that a hypergraph is a generalization of an undirected graph, where edges can connect more than two nodes, and is given by a set V of vertices and a set of hyperedges each of which is a subset of V . The causal structure of a type (n, k) unitary can conveniently be represented by a hypergraph, with a vertex for each input, and a hyperedge for each parental set. In drawing such hypergraphs, we will often distinguish the hyperedges with different colours, rather than label them with outputs of the unitary.

The derivation of causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for the remaining 6 causal structures from Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref>-39 remains open. The proof techniques employed otherwise in this work do not seem to allow a treatment of these 6 cases in an as straightforward way.</p><p>The ideas common to all derivations of causally faithful extended circuit decompositions so far are the following. The starting point is the factorization of the unitary channel's CJ operator according to Thm. 1 into pairwise commuting marginal operators. Second, Lem. 1 is used and applied to appropriately chosen subsets of the commuting operators. Third, Lem. 2 is used to infer that the marginal channels that act on the respective subspaces obtained from Lem. 1, are reduced unitary channels. Fourth, by appealing to uniqueness of purification, a unitary map is argued to exist which is a composition of the discovered data -in direct sum, tensor product and sequentially -such that it constitutes a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition of the given unitary.</p><p>Returning to the open (4, 4) cases, first observe that they are all 'self-dual', so that Prop. 1 does not allow any further reduction of one case to another. The reason then that these cases are less obvious is that Lem. 1 only considers a pair of commuting operators, while no matter which pairs (of subsets) of the commuting operators obtained from Thm. 1 one considers, the resulting 'splitting' involves input systems in a way that would seem to spoil faithfulness of the decomposition if simply following the above sketched proof recipe. It is left for future work to explore results in the theory of operator algebras, pertaining to sets of three or more pairwise commuting algebras, that might facilitate progress with the open cases.</p><p>7 Further discussion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Functions, unitaries and general channels</head><p>Thus far, this work studied causal and compositional structure only of unitary transformations between quantum systems. In a purely classical set-up, given a function f : X 1 × ... × X n → Y 1 × ... × Y k with variables X i and Y j taking values in sets of finite cardinality d X i and d Y j , write X i Y j ('X i does not influence Y j ') if Y j does not depend on X i for all values of X l , l = i. Analogously to unitary transformations (see Def. 2), for each j = 1, ..., k let the subset P a(Y j ) ⊆ {X 1 , ..., X n } denote the causal parents of Y j , that is, the subset of input variables on which Y j depends through f . The causal structure of f then is the family of parental sets {P a(Y j )} k j=1 . Recalling Theorem 5, given a unitary transformation U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">H A 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H An → H B 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H B k</formula><p>it holds that A i has a causal influence on B j if and only if B j has a causal influence on A i in the inverse transformation U † -the causal structure of U † is obtained from that of U by inverting all arrows. An analogous statement does not hold for reversible functions: consider for instance the classical CNOT gate f : C × T → C × T with control bit C, for which T depends on C, but not conversely, while f is its own inverse function <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">foot_11</ref> . Thus, the 'reversibility' of causal structure of unitary transformations is not a mere consequence of the reversibility of the linear maps, but a special property of unitary transformations. One may conjecture that the apparent difference between classical and quantum causal structure disappears once further restricting reversible functions to those which classically play an analogous role to unitary transformations in quantum theory, i.e., to symplectic transformations on discrete phase spaces.</p><p>A feature in turn shared by causal structure of functions and unitary transformations is the intransitivity of causal relations under composition of functions and unitaries, respectively. If A influences B through the unitary transformation U 1 and B influences C through U 2 , then in U 2 U 1 -provided this composition is well-typed -it is not necessarily the case that A influences C. This means that the question of finding a causally faithful (extended) circuit decomposition of some unitary transformation U cannot in general be reduced to the same problem for component unitaries in some fixed decomposition of U .</p><p>Moving away from functions and unitary transformations (and their associated unitary channels), things are less straightforward. Given a generic quantum channel C :</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">L(H A 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H An ) → L(H B 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H B k ),</formula><p>it is possible to articulate a definition similar to Def. 1, which captures when a particular input subsystem A i cannot signal to a particular output subsystem B j . One can also similarly, for each separate output B j , define the parental set P a(B j ) as those input systems which can signal to B j . However, for a generic channel C it is not the case that the set of 'single-system' no-signalling relations determine the overall signalling structure of C: even if A i cannot signal to B j and also not to B l for j = l, it may nonetheless be the case that A i can signal to the composite B j B l . Hence, the overall signalling structure is not naturally captured by a DAG with arrows from input systems to output systems, rather it is in general the family of parental sets for each subset of output systems. The same observation holds for the signalling structure of general classical channels.</p><p>Note that if the signalling structure of a quantum channel C is not a DAG, then it does not make sense to ask after a decomposition of C that is faithful to the set of singlesystem no-signalling relations, analogous to the study of causally faithful extended circuit decompositions of unitary transformations. This is the main reason we focus on unitary transformations in this work. See the discussion of future work in Sec. 8 for an avenue of extending the present work for whenever that is possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">The permissible causal structures</head><p>In light of the results stated in the previous sections, one may wonder which causal structures, seen as purely combinatorial objects, are permissible at all. For any natural numbers k and n, does any choice of k non-empty subsets of a set of cardinality n, represent the causal structure of some type (n, k) unitary?</p><p>It is straightforward to see that the answer is 'yes' if the question is put so broadly, without any dimensional restrictions. For any choice of k subsets P a(B j ) of a set {A 1 , ..., A n }, the following is an example of a unitary U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">H A 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H An → H B 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H B k which</formula><p>instantiates that causal structure.

Consider for instance a unitary transformation of the form U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">H A 1 ⊗ H A 2 → H B 1 ⊗ H B 2</formula><p>and suppose that the causal structure of U is as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">49a,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref> In particular, it is immediate that for two systems S 1 and S 2 that are evolving according to some unitary U : H S 1 ⊗ H S 2 → H S 1 ⊗ H S 2 , these systems S 1 and S 2 either interact, in which case there is necessarily mutual causal influence, or else they do not interact and U factorises. It is a generic phenomenon that a causal structure imposes dimensional restrictions on the inputs and outputs of unitary transformations that instantiate that particular causal structure. While it is in general a non-trivial question what these constraints are, whenever a causally faithful extended circuit diagram is implied by a causal structure, the dimensional restrictions imposed by that causal structure can be read off just as done in the previous example.</p><formula xml:id="formula_104">A1 A2 B1 B2 P a(B 1 ) = {A 1 , A 2 } P a(B 2 ) = {A 2 } (a) W V B1 B2 A1 A2 (b)</formula><p>One can analyze the causal structures of classical functions in a similar manner. The analogous question concerns reversible functions f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_105">X 1 × ... × X n → Y 1 × ... × Y k from n variables to k variables,</formula><p>taking values in sets of finite cardinality d X i and d Y j , respectively. For arbitrary natural numbes n, k, do all choices of k subsets of {X 1 , ..., X n } appear as the causal structure of some reversible function? It is easy to see that the answer is 'yes' as long as the cardinalities d X i and d Y j are not fixed, but also that causal structure imposes constraints on the cardinalities so that if cardinalities are fixed, then a reversible function with a given causal structure may not exist. Interestingly, these constraints differ from those for unitary transformations. For example, with A 1 , A 2 , B 1 , B 2 all classical bits, then a classical CNOT gate, with control on A 2 , instantiates the causal structure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">49a</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">12</ref></p></div>

More generally, given any unitary circuit with ingoing wires I 1 , ..., I l and outgoing wires O 1 , ..., O m , if n wires are split to define quantum nodes N 1 , ..., N n , this yields a quantum n-comb and defines a unitary U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_109">H I 1 ⊗...⊗H I l ⊗H N out 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H N out n → H O 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H Om ⊗ H N in 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H N in n .</formula><p>If the quantum nodes are localized in space-time, then it will in general be the case that some of the N out 1 , ..., N out n (formally input systems of U ) are after some of the N in 1 , ..., N in n (formally output systems of U). Nonetheless, according to Def. 2 this unitary U has a causal structure {P a(O j )} m j=1 ∪ {P a(N in i )} n i=1 . Now suppose a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition of the unitary map U is known. Seeing as U arises from a broken unitary circuit, there exists a labeling of the nodes N 1 , ..., N n such that any N out i cannot influence any N in j for j ≤ i, with i, j ∈ {1, ..., n}. Hence, one can appropriately bend the wires in the extended circuit diagram of U , so as to 're-identify' pairs of Hilbert spaces as belonging to one and the same quantum node. This reveals a compositional structure of the higher-order map that makes its causal structure evident. For instance, consider the broken unitary circuit defined as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">51b</ref>. Let the corresponding unitary be denoted U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">I1 I2 O1 O2 (a) -→ I1 I2 N O1 O2 (b) swaps ←- I1 I2 N out N in O2 O1 (c) = I1 I2 N out N in O2 O1 (d)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_111">H I 1 ⊗ H I 2 ⊗ H N out → H O 1 ⊗ H O 2 ⊗ H N in .</formula><p>Note that U is the same unitary as the one discussed in Sec. 3 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>The main result of this work has been to show, for a large class of unitary transformations, that the causal structure of the unitary implies a causally faithful (extended) circuit decomposition, which gives an understanding of causal structure in compositional terms where this was previously not possible. The proof techniques presented in Sec. 6 could be used to derive causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for many more causal structures not explicitly treated in this paper. However, there are also cases where it does not seem as straightforward, such as the 6 causal structures of type (4, 4) unitaries shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">34</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">35</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">36</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">37</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">38</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">39</ref>.</p><p>We formulated the hypothesis that every unitary has a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition (see Sec. 6). We do not know of any counterexample, but leave proving or disproving the hypothesis as an open problem. Note that the results we have presented in fact support a stronger version of the hypothesis. The results in Sec. 6 are all of the form that a given causal structure, expressed in terms of the purely combinatorial data of a family of sets {P a(B j )} k j=1 , implies a general form of causally faithful extended circuit diagram, such that any unitary transformation with that causal structure can be represented with a diagram of that form. A stronger version of the hypothesis would thus be that a general causally faithful extended circuit diagram exists for every causal structure. In principle it is conceivable that the latter is false while the weaker version remains true in the sense that every particular unitary transformation has a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition, but where these decompositions differ amongst unitaries with the same causal structure.</p><p>Beyond establishing the validity or otherwise of the main hypothesis, there are at least two avenues for future work. First, the extended circuit diagrams, which were informally introduced in Sec. 5, can be developed as a formal language with well-defined syntax and semantics. For work in this direction, see Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The development of a formal and compositional language is a necessary step to understand better the relation of our work to other graphical calculi. This includes, for example, the work by Reutter and Vicary on 'shaded tangles' (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>), which provides an alternative graphical representation of the compositional structures expressible with extended circuit diagrams. The index sets parametrizing families of Hilbert spaces and linear maps, explicit as indices in the extended circuit diagrams here, are there represented graphically through shaded regions, leading to high-dimensional geometric objects to represent compositional structures such as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10a</ref>. Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> are not, however, concerned with a causal analysis. For other graphical calculi that may be relevant, see, e.g., Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr">65]</ref>.</p><p>Second, while this work focused on unitary transformations, future work will study the extent to which the 'signalling structure' of non-unitary quantum channels can be understood in compositional terms and whether the extended circuit diagrams can be usefully extended to non-unitary channels. As discussed in Sec. 7.1 not any generic quantum channel C :</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">L(H A 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H An ) → L(H B 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ H B k )</formula><p>is amenable to such an analysis because its overall signalling structure is not determined by the parental sets P a(B j ) alone. However, suppose its Choi-Jamiołkowski representation ρ C B 1 ...B k |A 1 ....An happens to factorize into pairwise commuting marginal operators in the manner of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>). In that case, not only is the signalling structure fixed by the parental sets P a(B j ), but also a similar approach as in this work may then be exploited for the channel C -by exploiting the structural consequences from the pairwise commutation relations of the marginal operators. There is an important class of channels, whose Choi-Jamiołkowski representation satisfies that factorisation property, namely all those which formally arise from the process operator of a quantum causal model as defined in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Thus, combining the idea of a future version of extended circuit diagrams for appropriate non-unitary channels with the idea of applying the formalism to higher-order maps, as sketched in Sec. 7.3, paves a way to extending the formalism to quantum causal models. This would allow one to understand the causal structure of the quantum causal model in terms of compositional structure of its associated higher-order map and advance our understanding of causal structure in quantum theory.</p></div>

While a fully formal treatment of extended circuit diagrams as a graphical language with syntax, i.e., rules of composition, is beyond the scope of this work, this section shows that any extended circuit diagram to which the semantic rules of Sec. 5 can be applied, indeed satisfies soundness for causal structure.</p><p>In order to do this, it is useful first to introduce three additional features and rules for the use of extended circuit diagrams.</p><formula xml:id="formula_177">S T Vi Wi i i i i B1 B2 B3 A1 A2 A3 (a) S Vi Wi i i i i B1 B3 A1 A2 A3 (b) S Vi Wi i i i i B1 B3 A1 A2 A3 (c)</formula><note type="other">Figure 54</note><p>First, while the extended circuit diagrams that appear elsewhere in this work have no indices on open ingoing or outgoing wires, we now allow indices to appear on open wires of a diagram. Importantly, the same semantic rules as in Sec. 5 still allow the interpretation of such extended circuit diagrams with indexed open wires as unitary maps. As an example consider the diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">54b</ref>, which represents the unitary (spaces labeled as in Thm. 3):</p><formula xml:id="formula_178">i V i ⊗ W i 1 A 1 ⊗ S ⊗ 1 A 3 : H A 1 ⊗ H A 2 ⊗ H A 3 → H B 1 ⊗ i H Y L i ⊗ H Y R i ⊗ H B 3 .</formula><p>The represented unitary maps' in-and output spaces may hence involve direct sums over several factors all sharing certain indices. Allowing such diagrams will prove useful momentarily, but it is important to note that the property of soundness for causal structure only pertains to extended circuit diagrams as they were introduced in Sec. 5, i.e. to those where the open wires do not carry indices -only then is there a fixed tensor factorization into subsystems of the overall input and output space, relative to which causal structure is defined at all. Second, while extended circuit diagrams so far were used to represent unitary linear maps at the level of the underlying Hilbert spaces, they may now also represent the corresponding unitary channels: if an extended circuit diagram represents the unitary map U : H A → H B , where H A and H B may have a complex compositional structure of tensor products and direct sums, now let the same diagram also represent the associated unitary channel U : L H A → L H B , defined by U( ) = U ( )U † . The context will always make clear which map is being referred to. For example, the diagrams in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">54a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">54b</ref> may also represent the corresponding unitary channels.</p><p>Third, given this reading of an extended circuit diagram as unitary channel, we now also allow 'trace symbols', in form of the upside-down grounding symbol, to be composed with any of the outgoing wires of the diagram, including wires that carry indices. A wire that connects to a trace symbol is referred to as a traced wire and a diagram with traced wires as a traced extended circuit diagram. For an example, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">54c</ref>. A traced extended circuit diagram represents a CPTP map according to the following rule.</p><p>Trace-rule: Let G be a traced extended circuit diagram. Consider the set of indices appearing next to the traced wires, where each index is counted only once even if it appears on several traced wires. Let this set be denoted by, say, {i, j i , k, ...} and let the families of Hilbert spaces associated with the traced wires be denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_179">H D , {H X i } i , {H Z ij i } i,j i , {H Y k } k , .</formula><p>.. . Letting the unitary channel that is represented by the corresponding diagram without the traces<ref type="foot" target="#foot_15">foot_15</ref> be denoted V( ) = V ( )V † : L(H A ) → L(H B ), then the channel C that is represented by G -the diagram with the traces -is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_180">C( ) = i,j i ,k,...

( ) π ij i k... with π ij i k... being the projector on the corresponding (i, j i , k, ...)th subspace of H B .</formula><p>For illustration of the rule consider the diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">54c</ref> that represents the channel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_181">i Tr Y L i Y R i B 3 π i a V a ⊗ W a 1 A 1 ⊗ S ⊗ 1 A 3 ( ) 1 A 1 ⊗ S † ⊗ 1 A 3 b V † b ⊗ W † b π i (28) = i Tr Y L i Y R i B 3 V i ⊗ W i π i 1 A 1 ⊗ S ⊗ 1 A 3 ( ) 1 A 1 ⊗ S † ⊗ 1 A 3 π i V † i ⊗ W † i , (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_182">)</formula><p>where the second line follows from a straightforward calculation. Importantly, a consequence of the trace-rule is that a coherent summation over an index in the unitary channel (see independent summation over a and b in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>)) is turned into an incoherent one whenever that index appears on a traced wire (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_181">29</ref>)). In order to avoid clutter, π i is always used as the projector on the respective ith subspace, i.e., the context will always make clear which space's subspaces it concerns. Examples of more complex traced extended circuit diagrams where some indices are summed over incoherently and others coherently, can be found in the example of Sec. A.10.1 below. The soundness of extended circuit diagrams for causal structure is now easy to establish, given the following:</p><p>Claim 1 Consider a traced extended circuit diagram G. Suppose that in G, all outputs of a particular node n are traced. Form a traced extended circuit diagram G by removing the node n from G along with its output wires, and placing traces on all wires that are input to node n in G. Then, G represents the same CPTP map as G.</p><p>The claim is immediate given the trace-rule above. Soundness for causal structure now follows via steps analogous to those of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> for the case of ordinary circuits. Suppose G has n open input and k open output wires and represents the unitary U : H A 1 ⊗. . .⊗H An → H B 1 ⊗. . .⊗H B k . Consider some output B j and let B j := {B 1 , . . . , B k }\{B j }. Furthermore, let P j ⊆ {A 1 , . . . , A n } be the subset of those inputs A i such that there is a path from A i to B j in G and let P j := {A 1 , . . . , A n } \ P j . Now, letting G represent the unitary channel U ( )U † , consider the diagram that arises from G by plugging traces into all wires in B j , representing Tr B j [ U ( )U † ]. Apart from the node that has B j as an output wire, all nodes that have open output wires in G will now have all their output wires traced. Hence, they can be replaced by tracing their input wires instead. Again, all nodes with some traced output wires, but no path to B j will necessarily have to have all their output wires traced and can be replaced by traces on their input wires. With sufficient iteration of this step of letting the 'traces fall through', any node that is not on a path from any of the input wires in P j to B j disappears, until eventually all inputs in P j are traced. It follows that any input system that has no path to output system B j in G, can also not influence B j through the unitary that is represented by G.</p><p>The next subsection illustrates the proof by working through a concrete example in detail. Considering for instance output system B 2 , observe that A 4 , A 5 and A 6 all have no path to B 2 . Let us verify that any unitary U of the form of that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">55</ref> necessarily satisfies the constraint that none of A 4 , A 5 or A 6 can influence B 2 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_183">A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 B 1 B 2 B 3 B 4 B 5 F G P i T i W iji Q iji U ik V ik S i ik ik ik ik k i k i k k i i i i i ij i ij i ij i ij i Y L k Y R k Z (1) i Z (2) i Z (3) i N L ij i N R ij i M L ij i M R ij i X (1) ik X (2) ik X (3) i</formula><p>In the following, the left column shows a sequence of traced extended circuit diagrams with their interpretation as a channel according to above trace-rule to their right, separated by the symbol ' ='.
