<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>according to Kenneth and Yukl includes: (a) their performance depends on his efforts and abilities compared to performance through groups, (b) has the ability to complete difficult tasks, and (c) there is often concrete feedback on how he should carry out their duties optimally, effectively, and efficiently. Likewise, with a teacher in working in the field of education, a teacher also needs motivation to work, whether that motivation comes from within themselves or outside. Motivation is the desire to be involved in certain activities, providing the driving force that creates the enthusiasm of one's work so that they want to work together, work effectively and are integrated with all their efforts to achieve satisfaction. Teacher motivation is classified into two aspects, namely extrinsic and intrinsic motivation so that motivation is the driving force that motivates people to take action to achieve the goals of a teacher <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Firdaus, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Karyadi, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Martini, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Normaini, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rudiansyah, 2022)</ref>. Work motivation is a basic human need and as an encouragement that is expected to meet the desired basic needs. Low work motivation will result in low performance, despite having good abilities and opportunities. Teachers who have high motivation will carry out their duties enthusiastically and energetically because there are certain motives/ goals behind these actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albuni, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huda, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Noriawati, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Novita, 2022)</ref>. Improving the learning quality is the responsibility of all parties involved in education, especially for teachers who are the spearhead of secondary school education. Teachers play a role in creating quality human resources that can compete in the era of rapid technological development. Teacher's vital role is a challenge for teachers to achieve learning quality. Improving the learning quality becomes increasingly important for schools to gain better control through their own efforts. The learning quality is the main problem that will ensure the development of schools in achieving status in the midst of increasingly fierce competition in the world of education and guaranteeing students to become superior outputs. Improving the learning quality or school quality is focused on the quality of graduates. It would be hard if education or schools produce quality graduates if it is not through a quality learning process as well. A quality learning process must be supported by qualified and professional personnel, such as administrators, teachers, counselors, and administration. This is also supported by educational facilities and infrastructure, facilities, media, and adequate learning resources, both in quality and quantity, sufficient costs, proper management and a supportive environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mulyani et al., 2012)</ref>. Improving the quality of learning means creating an educated generation that is able to compete in the global community and the demands of change itself. In other words, if the existing learning practices in schools or educational institutions are still trapped in problems that hinder the development of the potential, talents, interests, and opportunities of students to develop themselves, it is difficult to expect these education graduates to be able to face the guidance change and global competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Saputra, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Suriansyah &amp; Effendi (2019)</ref> research study entitled " Effect of Academic Supervision and School Culture on Teacher's Teaching Quality in Public Islamic Senior High School Banjarmasin" showed that the principal's academic supervision affects the teaching quality of teachers at MAN Banjarmasin. The statistical analysis proves that the t-table value is 1.982 while the ttest results showed the t-test value is 7.826 so that t-count &gt; t-table <ref type="bibr">(7.826 &gt; 1.982)</ref>. Similarly, research study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Poernamawijaya et al. (2018)</ref> entitled "Contribution on Supervision of Supervisor, Principals Motivation, Kindergarten Teacher Performance to Improving the Kindergarten Quality in West Banjarmasin, Indonesia" states there is a direct contribution of Supervisor Supervision to Principal's Motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RESEARCH METHOD</head><p>This research is a correlational descriptive research. It aims to describe and analyze direct and indirect correlations of teacher academic supervision toward learning quality through competence and work motivation of teachers in accredited Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala. The population of this study were all teachers of Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala as many as 178 people. To determine the number of the research samples, proportional random sampling technique was used and the obtained sample was 124 people. The data of this research study were collected through the assessment instrument for teacher academic supervision, competence, teacher work motivation, and learning quality. The instrument of this study used a Likert scale in the form of a check list with alternative answers scored 1, 2, 3, and 4 with this ordinal scale consisting of 4 alternative answers, namely for the answer "Strongly Agree" scored 4, "Agree" scored 3, " Disagree" is scored 2 and "Disagree" is scored 1. Before the questionnaire was distributed to the research sample, the research instrument was first tested for the validity and reliability of the instrument. The obtained results of the instrument are 19 valid statement items on teacher's academic supervision, 20 valid statement items on competence, 19 valid statement items on teacher work motivation, and 28 valid statement items on learning quality. The data was analyzed using a path analysis to see the direct and indirect correlation, by first conducting the normality test, multicollinearity test, and heteroscedasticity test. The research approach used was a quantitative associative.</p></div>

Meanwhile, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref> is a summary of the decisions on hypothesis testing H6 and H7 with the provision that if the indirect test is greater than 1.96 (standard absolute z value) then there is a mediating effect. Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>, it can be concluded that H6 is accepted, while H7 is rejected. Based on the results of the analysis in Tables <ref type="table">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>, this study found a correlation between variables which can be explained as follows.</p><p>A. Direct correlation between teacher's academic supervision (X) and teacher competence (Z1) in A-Accredited Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala The results of the path analysis showed that teacher academic supervision has a significant effect on teacher competence. This means that there is a direct effect of teacher academic supervision on the competence of Public Senior High Schools teachers in Barito Kuala. The magnitude of the direct effect (p4) is (0.282) (standardized coefficients beta). The effect of the teacher academic supervision variable on teacher competence is 0.079 or 7.9%. Glickman in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sudjana (2012)</ref> suggests that academic supervision is a series of activities to help teachers develop their ability to manage the learning process in order to achieve learning objectives. The results of this study are supported by research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rahabav ( 2016)</ref> who stated that one of the variables thought to affect student absorption is teacher competence, especially professional competence and pedagogic competence. The results of another study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Saleh et al. (2019)</ref> states that there is a positive and significant effect between the principal's academic supervision on the teacher's pedagogic competence. Theoretically, a professional teacher is expected to master his/her scientific field and be able to transfer it well to the students. To improve the professional abilities of teachers, principals play an important role. One of the dominant roles of the principal is as a supervisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Direct correlation between teacher academic supervision (X) and teacher's work motivation (Z2) in A-accredited Public</head><p>Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala Teacher academic supervision has a significant effect on teacher work motivation. Therefore, there is a direct effect of teacher academic supervision on the work motivation of Public Senior High Schools teachers in Barito Kuala. The magnitude of the direct effect (p4) is (0.307) (standardized coefficients beta). The effect of the teacher academic supervision variable on the teacher work motivation is 0.094 or 9.4%. According to Sergiovanni in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wahyuni et al., 2022)</ref>, work motivation is a person's desire and willingness to act, make decisions, and use all social and physical abilities in order to achieve certain goals. Hence, teacher work motivation is a condition that moves, encourages or stimulates someone to carry out an activity to achieve its goals. According to the research study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rahabav (2016)</ref>, academic supervision if carried out effectively will have a positive effect on the growth of teachers professionally. The effect of academic supervision can be seen from several indicators such as: inviting teachers to supervisors to supervise classes, increasing teaching motivation, initiating discussions between teachers, increasing teacher innovation and creativity to produce designs, working of art or intellectual property in the form of research and publications, and student achievement which shows an increasing trend. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Habibi et al. (2018)</ref> in their research showing that the effect of academic supervision on teacher work motivation is positive and significant. Another study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kusrini et al. (2018)</ref> reporting that there is an effect of supervisor academic supervision on teacher work motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. There is a direct correlation between teacher competence (Z1) and learning quality (Y) in A-accredited Public Senior</head><p>High Schools in Barito Kuala The results of the path analysis showed that teacher competence has a significant effect on the learning quality. Thus, there is a direct effect of teacher competence on the learning quality at Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala. The direct effect (p4) is (0.762) (standardized coefficients beta). The effect of the teacher competence variable on the quality of learning is 0.581 or 58.1%. According to Hamalik (2010), teachers who have mastered competence will be more successful in carrying out learning compared to teachers who do not have competence. In the end, success in implementing learning will improve student learning achievement which will further improve the learning quality. Research study conducted by Sulastri et al. (2020) stated that teacher competence is one of the factors that affect the achievement of learning and educational goals at Public Junior High School 8 Prabumulih. However, teacher competence does not stand alone. It is affected by educational background, teaching experience, and length of teaching. Teacher competence can be considered important as a selection tool in the acceptance of prospective teachers. It can also be used as a guide in the framework of fostering and developing teacher staff. In addition, it is important in relation to teaching and learning activities and student learning outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The direct effect of the teacher's work motivation (Z2) with the learning quality (Y) of A-accredited Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala</head><p>The work motivation of teachers has a significant effect on the quality of learning. This means that there is a direct effect of teacher work motivation on the quality of learning at Public Senior High Schools Barito Kuala. The direct effect (p4) is (0.376) (standardized coefficients beta). The magnitude of the effect of the teacher's work motivation variable on the quality of learning is 0.141 or 14.1%. According to McGregor in As'ad (2004), a person is encouraged to do activities because he hopes this will lead to a more satisfying state than the current state. Work motivation for teachers is important because every individual is required to work hard and full of enthusiasm to achieve maximum results. Supriadi's research (2017) showed that learning will run even better if it is supported by teacher creativity in improving the learning quality including a teacher must be able to make students more interested in each subject. With more creative teaching, students will certainly be more enthusiastic in participating in learning during class. Therefore, a teacher must continue to improve their innovation and creativity in an effort to improve the quality of learning for their students. Therefore, teachers in improving innovation and creativity need to be supported by the quality of learning that has good quality and high motivation, both from within and outside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The effect of the direct correlation of teacher's academic supervision (X) with the learning quality (Y) of Aaccredited</head><p>Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala Teacher academic supervision has a significant effect on the learning quality. Therefore, there is a direct effect of teacher academic supervision on the quality of learning at Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala. The direct effect (p4) is (0.284) (standardized coefficients beta). The magnitude of the effect of the teacher academic supervision variable on the quality of learning is 0.081 or 8.1%. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Karwati &amp; Priansa (2013)</ref>, principals as supervisors must be able to guide teachers efficiently who can instill trust, stimulate and guide professional research &amp; cooperative efforts that can demonstrate their ability to assist teachers in solving the problems they face and are able to conduct studies and professional development in order to improve the quality of teaching and learning. According to Masliah's research study (2019), the implementation of good supervision ideally has a positive effect on the quality of education in a school. When each stage of the supervision is carried out properly and there is good cooperation between education providers, the school will have good quality. In the research journal of Susanti et al. (2020), the academic supervision variable had a significant and positive effect on the quality of teacher teaching in State Junior High Schools on Rimau Island. This is evidenced by the results of hypothesis testing which states that the value of t-count &gt; t-table as an interpretation process has been carried out, while the value of t-count is 58,831 &gt; t-table is 2,0195.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. The indirect correlation of teacher academic supervision (X) to the quality of learning (Y) through teacher competence (Z1) in A-accredited Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala</head><p>The results of path analysis showed that the indirect effect of teacher academic supervision (X) on the learning quality (Y) through teacher competence (Z1) is 0.282 x 0.782 = 0.220. Based on the path analysis test, the results of the direct and indirect effect of teacher academic supervision (X) on the learning quality (Y) through teacher competence (Z1) showed that the indirect effect was smaller than the direct effect. Ability development is not only emphasized on increasing the knowledge and teaching skills of teachers, but there is also an increase in commitment, willingness or motivation of teachers, the quality of learning will increase. The essence of the academic supervision dimension is in the context of fostering teachers to improve the quality of the learning process. Manan's research (2014) states that the success or failure of a school and the high and low quality of the school are not only determined by the number of teachers and their skills, but are more determined by the way the principal carries out leadership in his school. Likewise, to carry out supervision &amp; improve the quality of education in schools, the factors that determine not only teachers, but also how to utilize the abilities of the teachers and how the principal can include all the potential that exists in his/ her group as much as possible. The role of the principal must contribute to the success, excellence, and quality of the school, namely: (1) having a school vision; (2) determining the philosophy, mission, goals and objectives of the school; (3) explaining its vision to all staff and students including parents and the community; (4) setting goals, strategies and teaching curricula; (5) supervising, monitoring, evaluating curriculum and teaching programs; (6) coordinating school teaching programs and extracurricular activities; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> monitoring student learning time; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> encouraging and supporting professional development for teachers; (9) assisting and supporting teachers in teaching and providing incentives and resources; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> controlling the quality of teaching in schools; and (11) creating a conducive school climate to improve the learning process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. The indirect correlation of teacher academic supervision (X) to the quality of learning (Y) through teacher work motivation (Z2) in A-accredited Public high school in Barito Kuala</head><p>The indirect effect of teacher academic supervision (X) on the quality of learning (Y) through teacher work motivation (Z 2 ) is 0.307 x 0.376 = 0.115. Based on the path analysis test, the results of the direct and indirect effect of teacher academic supervision (X) on the quality of learning (Y) through teacher work motivation (Z2) showed that the indirect effect was smaller than the direct effect. According to Sudjana <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Leniwati &amp; Arafat, 2017)</ref>, the purpose of supervision is to help teachers develop their abilities to achieve learning goals that must be achieved by students by increasing the knowledge and skills of teaching teachers, increasing commitment, and the willingness and motivation of teachers because by increasing the abilities and work motivation of teachers, the learning quality will increase. The results of Rahabav's research study (2016) stated that some of the tangible results they obtained</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Academic Supervision toward Learning Quality through Competence and Work Motivation of Teachers in A-Accredited Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala</head><p>from the academic supervision of teachers recognized by the principal were an increase in teacher work motivation in teaching; teachers feel better prepared to teach and they find it helpful to improve the quality of the learning process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on the results of the analysis and discussion in this study, the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are: There is a correlation between teacher academic supervision and the competence of A-accredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. There is a correlation between teacher academic supervision and work motivation of A-accredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. There is a correlation between teacher competence and the quality of learning for teachers of A-accredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. There is a correlation between teacher work motivation and the learning quality of Aaccredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. There is a correlation between teacher's academic supervision and the quality of learning of A-accredited of A-accredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. There is an indirect correlation between teacher academic supervision and the quality of learning through the competence of A-accredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. There is no indirect correlation between teacher academic supervision on the quality of learning through the work motivation of A-accredited Public High School teachers in Barito Kuala. A professional teacher is expected to master his/her scientific field and be able to transfer it well to the students. Therefore, teachers in improving innovation and creativity need to be supported by the quality of learning that has good quality and high motivation. In achieving this, the role of the principal must contribute to the success, excellence, and quality of the school. Based on the results of the study, it can be suggested that: (1) the principal should be able to direct teachers in making questions for evaluation, guide teachers in planning and implementing remedial programs, and give rewards to teachers even though the results of academic supervision are good, (2) teachers should can apply TPACK (Technological Pedagogic Content Knowledge) in learning and use students' worksheets to facilitate student understanding in learning as well as use teaching aids to facilitate student understanding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>toward Learning Quality through Competence and Work Motivation of Teachers in A-Accredited Public Senior High Schools in Barito Kuala</figDesc></figure>
