<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we tackle the problem of persistently covering a complex non-convex environment with a team of robots. We consider scenarios where the coverage quality of the environment deteriorates with time, requiring to constantly revisit every point. As a first step, our solution finds a partition of the environment where the amount of work for each robot, weighted by the importance of each point, is equal. This is achieved using a power diagram and finding an equitable partition through a provably correct distributed control law on the power weights. Compared to other existing partitioning methods, our solution considers a continuous environment formulation with non-convex obstacles. In the second step, each robot computes a graph that gathers sweep-like paths and covers its entire partition. At each planning time, the coverage error at the graph vertices is assigned as weights of the corresponding edges. Then, our solution is capable of efficiently finding the optimal open coverage path through the graph with respect to the coverage error per distance traversed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recent advances in mobile robotics and an increasing development of affordable autonomous mobile robots have motivated an extensive research in multi-robot systems. * The complexity of these systems resides in the design of communication, coordination and control strategies to perform complex tasks that a single robot is not able to do by itself. A particularly interesting task is that of persistent coverage, in which a team of robots aims to maintain a desired coverage level over time in a given environment. The particularity of persistent coverage, as opposed to other known coverage problems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cortes et al. (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Panagou et al. (2017)</ref>, is that the coverage level deteriorates with time. This implies that the robots need to revisit every point in the environment in order to keep the coverage at the desired levels. This problem is of special interest in many applications such as vacuuming, <ref type="bibr">Mackenzie and Balch (1993)</ref>, cleaning a place where dust is continuously settling, <ref type="bibr">Kakalis and Ventikos (2008)</ref>, lawn mowing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arkin et al. (2000)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sahin and Guvenc (2007)</ref> or environmental monitoring, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Smith et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Paley et al. (2008)</ref>. More recently, the apparition of useful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has encouraged the application of persistent coverage to surveillance and monitoring, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Renzaglia et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nigam (2014)</ref>.</p><p>The solutions to this problem can be separated into two different groups, according to the division of the environment that is adopted to carry out the coverage mission. In the first group of solutions, all the robots cover the entire environment together in a cooperative manner, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nigam et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Atinc ¸et al. (2014)</ref>, i.e., they are not restricted to particular areas. The second group is composed of partitionbased solutions. They address the problem with a divideand-conquer strategy in the sense that they partition the environment and assign each partition to a single robot that becomes responsible of developing the coverage on it, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barrientos et al. (2011)</ref>. The advantages of the second type are that, once the environment is partitioned, each robot can work independently, with no risk of collision and with no need for communication in the normal operation of the system. For these reasons, we propose a solution of this type and pay special attention to the partitioning and the singlerobot coverage inside each region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Environment Partitioning</head><p>The most well-known partition technique for coverage in multi-robot systems is the Voronoi tesellation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cortes et al. (2004)</ref>. Although different partition strategies for coverage had been previously proposed, <ref type="bibr">Jager and Nebel (2002)</ref>, the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XX(X)</head><p>Voronoi partition has been the most used, especially for static coverage, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pierson et al. (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moon and Frew (2017)</ref>. This type of partition has been successfully used in persistent coverage tasks for convex environments, <ref type="bibr">Palacios-Gasós et al. (2016a)</ref> or environments with few obstacles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Palacios-Gasós et al. (2017)</ref>. However, they present two important drawbacks. In general, these partitions do not take into account the shape of the environment nor they account for obstacles and non-convexity. The second and most important drawback is that, since they are purely geometric, the coverage share-out is not equitable. This overloads some robots, while others have less work assigned than they can carry out.</p><p>Equitable partitions in convex environments are usually calculated in a centralized fashion. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Araujo et al. (2013)</ref> a line in the optimal sweeping direction is moved along the environment to slice it each time the area on one of the sides is the same as any required partition. A polygon decomposition is applied in <ref type="bibr">Maza and Ollero (2007)</ref>, with the restriction of including the robot position inside its partition, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Peters et al. (2017)</ref> an algorithm handles sporadic communication between each robot and a central base to update the partition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pavone et al. (2011)</ref> compute equitable partitions in convex environments using power diagrams in a distributed way.</p><p>On the other hand, the assumption of convex environments is not reasonable when it comes to ground vehicles. In non-convex environments, solutions based on Lloyd's algorithm appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pimenta et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Breitenmoser et al. (2010b)</ref>. This algorithm is also combined with the geodesic distance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bhattacharya et al. (2014)</ref>, together with a graph-based path planning for exploration. Frontierbased exploration of a non-convex environment is treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haumann et al. (2011)</ref>. Power diagrams are considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Thanou et al. (2013)</ref> for heterogeneous teams. Complete coverage is guaranteed in <ref type="bibr">Kapoutsis et al. (2017)</ref>, with a specifically tailored, optimality preserving, technique. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sea et al. (2017)</ref>, the features of online obstacle and decay learning are added to a decentralized partitioning of the target area on the basis of the robot performance. The main difference of our approach with respect to these solutions is that the resulting partition is equitable in terms of the robots' workload.</p><p>Over discrete representations and graphs, Voronoi-based load-balancing partitions are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boardman et al. (2016)</ref> and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Durham et al. (2012)</ref>, where it is combined with a gossip algorithm. Surfaces in 3D are treated in <ref type="bibr">Breitenmoser et al. (2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Breitenmoser et al. ( , 2014))</ref>. Distributed vertex substitution is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yun and Rus (2014)</ref>, with twohop communication to guarantee convergence to the locally optimal configuration. Compared to the aforementioned works, our partitioning approach works for a continuous environment formulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Planning of Coverage Paths</head><p>There are many possibilities to define the motion of the robot inside their partitions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Galceran and Carreras (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nigam (2014)</ref>. Some solutions posed the problem as a feedback control problem, deciding at each time which is the best direction to move <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Franco et al. (2013)</ref>. These solutions are easy to compute individually but typically lead the robots to local minima. Our solution is also computationally light but considers a larger planning horizon.</p><p>A wide variety of planning approaches look for closed paths that each robot can follow periodically to cover its entire partition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Xu et al. (2014)</ref>. Closed paths in square grids are computed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arkin et al. (2000)</ref>. Adaptive control is used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Soltero et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Lan and Schwager (2013)</ref> consider Rapidly-exploring Random Cycles in Gaussian Random fields. Discretized decay rates by a factor of 2 are considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Smith and Rus (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alamdari et al. (2014)</ref> to compute different tours for several robots based on the importance of each location. All these methods are closely related to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Their main advantage is that they typically allow for some measurable degree of optimality with respect to the optimal NP-hard solution. Compared to these methods, our planning algorithm considers fast online re-planning of open trajectories without being limited by the importance and decay factors of the vertices, at the cost of sacrificing bounds on the optimality gap with respect to the general problem.</p><p>Finally, we can find other similar solutions that deal with the online computation of open paths at particular times considering a finite-horizon. A prioritized A* algorithm together with barrier functions is used in <ref type="bibr">Ma et al. (2018)</ref>. An integer program applied over a receding planning horizon is solved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmadzadeh et al. (2007)</ref> to find the paths that maximize spatio-temporal coverage. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Graham and Cortés (2012)</ref> they obtain an approximate solution for a dynamic program over a finite time horizon, whose optimization criterion is the minimum uncertainty of a field estimate. The local path planning algorithm TangentBug is used in <ref type="bibr">Breitenmoser et al. (2010b)</ref> to plan the trajectories to the Voronoi centroids in a non-convex environment. A line strip over a triangular mesh of equally important points is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Breitenmoser et al. (2014)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Palacios-Gasós et al. (2017)</ref> a Fast Marching Method is used to compute optimal paths in terms of coverage quality to badly-covered areas. The main difference of our solution with respect to these approaches is that we consider an optimization of the coverage cost per node visited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Contributions</head><p>In this paper we propose a solution to persistently cover a complex, non-convex environment with a team of robots. Our solution works in two steps: the first one allows the robots to find an equitable partition of the environment in a distributed way, while the second one deals with the problem of individual online planning inside the partition using a graph representation.</p><p>The partitioning method builds upon the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pavone et al. (2011)</ref>. The main contribution is the extension of the method to a more general continuous environment formulation, including complex, non-convex ones, by developing the algorithm in terms of geodesic distance. This formulation allows the partition to be consistent with the shape of the environment. Additionally, we present two extensions of the algorithm to improve the partitions. The first one is designed to reduce the amount of disconnected partitions, in the sense that every partition is represented by a single connected component in the Prepared using sagej.cls whole environment, avoiding the need to walk through other partitions to cover it. The second extension allows the algorithm to compute equitable partitions weighted by the different capabilities of each robot. In all cases, convergence is guaranteed.</p><p>The second part of our solution deals with the problem of individual path planning for persistent coverage inside each partition. The method first generates a graph, discretizing the partition in a grid based on the coverage capabilities of the robot that will cover it. Then, an online planner is run asynchronously by each robot, where at each planning time, the coverage error at the graph vertices is assigned as weights of the corresponding edges. The planner finds then the path that maximizes the coverage quality per node visited using a variation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cormen (2009)</ref>). This allows the planning to be efficiently computed online with the particular advantages of using open paths that combined, resemble a sweeping strategy.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the problem formulation. In Section 3 we present the equitable partitioning method. We enhance the method to reduce disconnections in the partitions and consider energy constraints in Section 4. In Section 5 the strategy to plan paths and individually cover each partition is presented. Finally, we present simulation results in Section 6, experimental results in Section 7 and conclusions in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem Formulation</head><p>Let Q ⊂ R 2 be a known bounded environment, possibly non-convex, and Q f ⊆ Q the set of points in Q that are not obstacles. The objective of persistent coverage in this environment is to maintain the actual coverage level, represented by a time-varying field, Z(q, k) ≥ 0, as close as possible to a desired coverage objective, denoted as Z * (q) &gt; 0, ∀ q ∈ Q f . The importance of maintaining the coverage of each point is represented by a constant weighting function Φ(q) ∈ (0, 1].</p><p>The coverage level deteriorates over time with a constant decay rate, d(q), with 0 &lt; d(q) &lt; 1, according to the following recurrence equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Z(q, k) = d(q)Z(q, k -1) + α(q, k),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where α(q, k) is the total coverage action that a team of robots applies at point q of the environment at time instant k in order to satisfy the coverage objective.</p><p>The team is composed of N robots, located at positions p i (k), i ∈ {1, . . . , N }. The robots are capable of increasing the coverage in an area Ω i p i (k) ⊆ Q f , that we call coverage area. This area is bounded by a circle of radius r cov i , although it is not necessarily circular, convex or equal for all the robots. We denote by α i (q, k) the coverage value applied by the robot at position q. This value only depends on the physical properties of the robot, and outside of Ω i p i (k) is equal to zero.</p><p>In addition, we consider that the robots have the capability to adjust their production at each point of Ω i p i (k) by a coverage gain, 0 ≤ ρ i (q, k) ≤ 1. This way, the total coverage action is determined by α(q, k) = i∈{1,...,N } ρ i (q, k) α i (q, k).</p><p>(2)</p><p>From now on, to simplify the notation we omit the spatial dependencies, q, p i (k), in all the functions where it can be inferred by the context, e.g., Z(q, k) ≡ Z(k), α(k) ≡ α(q, k), Ω i (p i (k)) ≡ Ω i (k), etc.</p><p>In the paper, we consider that the coverage gain is adjusted as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Palacios-Gasós et al. (2017)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ρ i (k) =      1, if ρ * i (k) ≥ 1, ρ * i (k), if 0 &lt; ρ * i (k) &lt; 1, 0, if ρ * i (k) ≤ 0,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ * i (k) = Ωi(k) Φ • Z * -d Z(k -1) α i (k) dq Ωi(k) •Φ α i (k) 2 dq .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Intuitively, ρ * i (k) represents the fraction of the coverage action, α i (k), required to reach the desired level, Z * . Therefore, what this action is doing is basically to adjust the coverage production to prevent coverage values above Z * . Now, we are interested in finding trajectories, Γ i (k), for all the robots that make Z(k) as close as possible to Z * for the whole environment and every k. Addressing this problem as a whole, e.g., as an optimization problem of the coverage error over some time horizon, is only possible for small teams of robots and very coarse discretized environments, as can be seen in <ref type="bibr">Palacios-Gasós et al. (2016b)</ref>. The reason for this is that we need to account for the actions of multiple robots in the same environment, as well as the influence in the future coverage values of previous actions of the computed trajectories. Therefore, in this paper we adopt a divide and conquer strategy to address the problem in two stages.</p><p>In a first stage, described in Sections 3 and 4, we focus on dividing the environment into N disjoint regions, one for each robot, such that the work needed to cover them, in terms of coverage action is equal. This way, we simplify the problem of finding N paths into N individual problems of finding a single path in a smaller environment. This partition can be computed once offline and be assumed constant afterwards.</p><p>In a second stage, detailed in Section 5, we propose an online planning algorithm that each robot executes locally within its partition to obtain the trajectories Γ i (k) that minimize the current coverage error. The most important simplification we make to keep the problem tractable is to disregard in the planning algorithm the influence of previous actions of the computed trajectory into the coverage value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Equitable Partitioning</head><p>The first step of our strategy to solve the persistent coverage problem is to divide the environment in as many equitable regions as robots. The goal is that each partition requires an amount of work proportional to the capabilities XX(X) of its assigned robot with respect to the rest of the team and to the importance of its points. To this end, we introduce the notions of power diagram and geodesic distance, define the importance-weighted workload of the agents in terms of the coverage problem and detail our distributed partitioning algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Power Diagrams and Geodesic Distance</head><p>Let us first define a set of points, G = {g 1 , . . . , g N }, with g i , g j ∈ Q f for all i and j and g i ̸ = g j if i ̸ = j, which will act as the generators of the partitions. Our algorithm to find the equitable partitions is based on power diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aurenhammer (1987)</ref>, that are a generalization of the Voronoi diagrams. Instead of assigning the points to each partition according to the Euclidean distance to the generator, the power diagrams use the squared distance minus a certain weight. If we let w = {w 1 , . . . , w N } be the set of power weights associated to the partitions, we can formally define the partitions obtained from the power diagram as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P i (w) = {q ∈ Q f | d(q, g i ) 2 -w i ≤ d(q, g j ) 2 -w j }.</formula><p>(5) In order to apply this partitioning to a non-convex environment, we make use of the geodesic distance, d g (q, g), the length of the shortest path between two points of the environment. Assuming that the environment is composed of polygonal obstacles, the shortest path between every two points is the concatenation of a set of straight lines connecting the two points and some vertices of the obstacles, {q, h 1 q,g , h 2 q,g , . . . , h lq,g q,g , g}, where l q,g is the number of obstacle vertices that define such path. Therefore, the geodesic distance can be decomposed in the summation of the Euclidean distances between each pair of consecutive points: d g (q, g) =∥q -h 1 q,g ∥ + ∥h 1 q,g -h 2 q,g ∥ + . . . + ∥h lq,g q,g -g∥.</p><p>(6)</p><p>Using this metric, the boundary between two partitions is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆ ij = {q ∈ Q f | d g (q, g i ) 2 -w i = d g (q, g j ) 2 -w j }.<label>(7</label></formula><p>) According to this definition, the neighbors of a generator are</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N i = {j ∈ {1, . . . , N } \ i | ∆ ij ̸ = ∅}. (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>We assume that each robot can communicate with robots of neighboring regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Importance-Weighted Workload</head><p>The partitions that are assigned to the robots have to be equitable in terms of the work that has to be carried out inside them. At the same time, they have to take into account the importance of the coverage of each point. Therefore, it is essential to define the workload in terms problem's variables. The definition of the work at each point of the environment that we consider is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">λ(q) = Φ (1 -d) Z * . (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>Strictly speaking, (1 -d) Z * is the actual workload of each each point. It represents the coverage that decays at each time if the point has reached the desired level, i.e., in the steady state. Nevertheless, we weight it with the importance to allow the robots to spend more time covering the most important points, at the expense of reducing the attention to less important points. This may lead to partitions in which (1 -d) Z * is not equitable but the importance of the work of each partition is. From now on, we refer to this importanceweighted workload simply as workload.</p><p>The workload inside each partition can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">λ Pi(w) = Pi(w) λ(q) dq,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Both the importance and the decay take values between 0 and 1. On the contrary, the desired coverage level is expressed in general in coverage units and, therefore, we normalize the entire workload by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q f Φ (1 -d) Z * dq to obtain it in percentages.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Distributed Algorithm for Equitable Partitioning</head><p>The power diagram can be seen as a relation between the weights and the regions that belong to their corresponding generators. Therefore, we minimize a cost function whose minima correspond to sets of weights that lead to an equitable partition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">H(w) = N i=1 1 λ Pi(w) .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>One can see that this function reaches its minimum when the workload of all the partitions is the same. It is also important to remark that such minimum can always be found, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pavone et al. (2011)</ref>. From now on, we omit the dependencies of H and P i with w for the sake of clarity.</p><p>To minimize this function distributively, each robot is in charge of a generator, that we locate at the robot's position for simplicity, and its associated weight, initially set to zero. The evolution of the weight is driven to achieve equity using information from the neighbors in the following control law.</p><p>Theorem 3.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XX(X)</head><p>Remark 3.2. The main differences of our proof with respect to the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pavone et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Partition Enhancements</head><p>The partitions obtained with the algorithm described in the previous section are proven to be equitable. However, for non-convex environments, especially for complex ones, they might be disconnected, in the sense that in order to reach some points of the partition, a robot needs to go through the partitions of other robots. This may affect significantly the persistent coverage of the environment. Moreover, they do not take into account the different capabilities that each robot might have. In this section we present two enhancements of our partitioning algorithm: one where we control the positions of the generators to reduce possible disconnections and other to account for energy and coverage power of the robots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Connectivity-Aware Partitioning</head><p>Let us begin by defining the connected components, P ℓ i (w), ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , L i }, L i ∈ Z + , that form a partition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">P i = Li ℓ=1 P ℓ i .

However, it cannot be moved straightaway in the direction g i g * i since there are two restrictions that must be taken into account. The first one is that the motion of the generator must not hinder the evolution of the weights towards the equitable partition. Therefore, such motion can only be executed if it contributes to the minimization of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">11</ref>) or, at least, it is not detrimental. The second restriction is that in a non-convex environment it has to follow the geodesic path from its current position to the center of mass to avoid sudden changes in the shape, size and workload of the partitions. If we call γ i the shortest path from g i to g * i , we want the generator to move in the direction γ i (g i ), that is the direction of the path at g i . In this context, the algorithm that we propose is presented in the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 4.1. The power diagram generated by G and w converges to an equitable power diagram under the distributed control law</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">ẇi = -k w ∂H ∂w i , (<label>33a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">) ġi = k g f sat g i g * i • -∂H ∂g i γ i (g i ),<label>(33b)</label></formula><p>with k w , k g , positive gains,</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">f sat (x) =      0, ∀ x ≤ 0, exp -1 (k sat x) 2 , ∀ x &gt; 0,<label>(34)</label></formula><p>a saturation function with k sat &gt; 0, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">∂H ∂g i,k = j∈Ni 1 λ 2 Pj - 1 λ 2 Pi ∆ij (h lq,g i q,gi -g i ) k ∥h lq,g i q,gi -g i ∥ λ(q) ∥n ′ ij (q)∥ dq,<label>(35)</label></formula><p>where n ′ ij (q) is the outward normal to the boundary between the partitions i and j at point q.</p><p>Proof. The convergence to an equitable power diagram is guaranteed under the first part of the control law, (33a), in Theorem 3.1. In this proof we only show that the second part of the control law, (33b), does not counteract this convergence.</p><p>The direction of motion of the generators that maximizes the improvement of the cost function is the gradient of the cost function with respect to g i , i.e., ∂H/∂g i . This gradient is obtained in the same way as with respect to w i in the proof of Theorem 3.1 with only two particularities. The derivatives of the geodesic distances with respect to g i,x are</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">∂d g (q, g i ) ∂g i,x = ∂∥q -h 1 q,gi ∥ ∂g i,x + • • • + ∂∥h lq,g i q,g -g i ∥ ∂g i,x = q -h 1 q,gi ∥q -h 1 q,gi ∥ • ∂q ∂g i,x - (h lq,g i q,g -g i ) x ∥h lq,g i q,g -g i ∥ , (36) ∂d g (q, g j ) ∂g i,x = ∂∥q -h 1 q,gj ∥ ∂g i,x = q -h 1 q,gj ∥q -h 1 q,gj ∥ • ∂q ∂g i,x ,<label>(37)</label></formula><p>and equivalent for g i,y . Note that in the first step of the first derivative all the intermediate terms represented with the dots are equal to zero since they do not depend on g i,x or q.

The saturation function in (33b) compares the direction of the gradient with the direction from the generator to the centroid of the biggest connected component. If both directions are approximately aligned, i.e., the movement of the generator to the centroid favors the convergence to the equitable partition, the generator is able to follow the geodesic path to the centroid according to γ i (g i ). Otherwise, if the movement to the centroid hinders the convergence, f sat = 0 and the generator does not move.</p><p>Remark 4.2. Even though Theorem 4.1 does not provide formal guarantees on connectedness, since the movement of the generator is towards the centroid of the component with the biggest workload, we can assert that this partition methodology favors connectivity of the regions.</p><p>Although the generators move towards their respective centroids, the convergence of the control law is to an equitable partition. Therefore, the generator may either reach the centroids or stop somewhere in the geodesic path to such point when an equitable partition is achieved.</p><p>It should also be noted that the motion of the generators in this control law is independent on the actual motion of the robots, which will be discussed in the Section 5. This also means that, if the computed partition is not satisfactory, e.g., is still disconnected, the algorithm can be run again with different initial conditions until a connected partition is obtained. Similarly, the robots can "trade" small regions of equivalent workload so that equity is preserved, but in such a way that the partitions are improved, e.g., connected or associated to physical rooms. We provide a more detailed empirical analysis in Section 6 where we analyze how often the resulting partitions are not connected, leaving more sophisticated partition mechanisms, like trading, for future work.</p></div>

The two circumferences represent the areas that the robot can cover when it is located at p 1 i = (0, 0) and p 2 i = (0, d i ), respectively. The two locations correspond to consecutive sweeps in the x direction, i.e. two vertices in V g i connected by an edge in E g i . Note that Ω i (p i ) does not have to be circular, but only bounded by the circumference, and that α i (p i ) can be any function. The optimal distance between these parallel sweeps, d i , is the one that optimizes the sum of the coverage provided from these two positions. In particular, the goal of ( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) is that the same coverage is provided to each point that can be covered by the robot from any of the positions. This coverage is represented by α, that is the sum of the coverage from the two positions divided by the total area. Therefore, α can also be seen as an average coverage level. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) computes the quadratic difference between the coverage provided to each point, i.e., the sum of α i from p 1 i and p 2 i , and this average to obtain a d i that keeps the coverage of all points as close as possible to α.

This also implies that at this stage robots do not need to share any coverage value with any other robot, since they act independently in their regions. It should also be noted that Proposition 5.1 is valid for any partition of the environment, as long as the graphs G i ensure that each robot can only apply coverage within its assigned partition. Likewise, the proposition can be applied to other cost functions that, similarly to f (k), consider additive cost in the points of the environment.

Instead of the shortest distance, we look for the highest accumulated error per vertex and, therefore, we initialize our metric to -∞ for all the nodes of the graph. Additionally, since the aim is to maximize this metric, the path to a vertex is updated and the vertex appended to the priority queue if the previously stored value of the metric is lower than the new one. It should be noted that these modifications do not alter the optimality of the method and maintain the worst-case complexity of O(|V i | |E i |).

The resulting work function λ(q) can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> for the Rooms environment, normalized by Q λ(q) dq and multiplied by 100.

These parameters were manually tuned in order to speed up the convergence of the partitions. In practice, there is no need to change these parameters for different environments. On the downside, the convergence time of the equitable partitions may vary and affect some environments more than others if they are not appropriately tuned. In any case, this time is negligible when compared with the duration of the task, that can be infinite.</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">k w =            k 1 w , if |∂H/∂w i | &gt; β 1 , k 2 w , if β 1 ≤ |∂H/∂w i | &lt; β 2 , k 3 w , if β 2 ≤ |∂H/∂w i | &lt; α 3 , k 4 w , if |∂H/∂w i | ≤ β 3 ,</formula><p>In our simulations the map is represented by a matrix of pixels (an image), so, even when the partition method is continuous, there is some degree of discretization. To compute the gradients, we keep track of the partition associated to each pixel, obtaining the boundaries by checking if all the neighbor pixels belong to the same one. Then, for the pixels in the boundary we compute the geodesic distance and (q -h 1 q,gj ) in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">26</ref>). From there, we can compute Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">29</ref>) and the gradient in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">13</ref>) by summing this value for all the points of the partition boundary.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Partitioning Example</head><p>In the first place we present an example of the partitioning algorithms in the different environments. In the top row of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> we show the resulting equitable partitions under (12), i.e., when only the weights are modified and the positions of the generators remain fixed. Although in some cases such as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4a</ref> the resulting partitions are connected, it can be seen that in others they are not, see e.g., yellow partition in Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>. These disconnections are avoided under (33) as can be seen in the bottom row of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In this case, moving the generators towards the centroid of the connected components with the highest workload at the same time as the weights are changing, allows the robots to find equitable and connected partitions.</p><p>Now we focus in the particular example of the Spiral environment to assess the evolution and convergence under both ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) and (33). In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> we represent the evolution of the workload, the weights and the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weight for each robot in a different color under <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. First of all, in the top Figure we can observe that all the workloads converge to the same percentage value (20%), that is, to the equity. Convergence is assumed when the maximum difference between the workload of the partitions is lower than a 5%. Secondly, it is noteworthy that the weights associated to the partitions at the bottom of the map (black and magenta) are negative, while the ones at the top (red and yellow) are positive. This makes sense when we consider that the workload is distributed as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Since the upper part is less important, robots in that area are assigned larger partitions, and therefore positive weights. Finally, the value of the gradient is represented in the bottom plot.</p><p>Under (33), in the beginning the weights and workloads also evolve slowly as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. The convergence speed of this law is similar to that in (12). The main difference appears in the bottom plot of the figure, where we show how often the motion of the generators is saturated, f sat in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_45">34</ref>). Values equal to zero mean that moving the generator goes against obtaining equity. The main consequence is that the evolution of the partitions is not as smooth as with ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) but all the resulting partitions are connected. In the following section we carry out a parametric analysis to be able to generalize the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Parametric Analysis of the Partitioning Algorithms</head><p>We analyze now the evolution of the performance of the partitioning algorithm when the parameters of the problem change. In particular, we performed a Monte Carlo analysis of 10 runs for different initial positions of the generators and different work functions in all the environments. In order to represent the results concisely, we refer to the different environments by their initials as follows: Open Rooms as OR, Rooms as R, Spiral as S and Maze as M. The 10 initial positions of the generators were selected randomly and the variation of the work function was done through the decay function. In (59) the decay is set to be a 2D Gaussian centered at |Q| x /2 and |Q| y /2, i.e., in the middle of the environment. Instead of this center, we chose a random point for each trial. We execute this analysis for ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_43">33</ref>) and refer to them as W and WG respectively, representing that only the power weights or the power weights and the generator positions are modified.  In the first place we show in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> two boxplots of the number of iterations required for the algorithm to converge to the equitable partition. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">7a</ref> shows the results for different initial positions of the generators and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>, for different decay functions. The most important feature of these results is that, for the same environment, WG converges in general faster than W. Among the different environments, the speed of convergence depends on the complexity of the environment and on the tuning of the gains.</p><p>In the second place we pay attention to the connectivity of the partitions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> gathers the number of partitions that resulted disconnected out of the 50 regions corresponding to each cell. As expected, this number is drastically reduced with the WG control law. In fact, for Open Rooms and Rooms, it converges to connected partitions in all cases. However, for Spiral and Maze the partitions result disconnected in some cases.</p><p>To evaluate the nature and the quality of the still nonconnected partitions in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> we represent in percentage the relative workload of the biggest connected component with respect to the workload of the entire partition. One can see that under WG, this value is on average above the 80%. This means that almost all the work of the partition is on the biggest component, whose centroid was followed by the generator. Therefore, a simple reassignment of the smaller disconnected regions could be done to reach total  connectivity with only a small deviation from the equitable partitioning. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Coverage Planning Results</head><p>In this part of the simulations we analyze the coverage planning solution and the performance of the entire approach with an example. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the partition of the Rooms environment and the path graphs of the robots. According to the work map showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the robot assigned to the blue partition has to cover a bigger area than the other four. These other four share the peak of the work map and each of them is additionally in charge of covering a big room on the righthand side or one and a half small rooms on the left-hand side. In order to evaluate the quality of the paths and the provided coverage we normalize the coverage error at a single point at time k,</p><formula xml:id="formula_83">ε(k) ≡ ε(q, k) = e(k) Z * 2 , (<label>62</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_84">)</formula><p>and calculate the mean normalized error over the environment as</p><formula xml:id="formula_85">ε(k) = Q f ε(k)dq |Q f | . (<label>63</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_86">)</formula><p>Prepared using sagej.cls  In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> we show the coverage error e(q, k) of the environment for eight different time instants. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">10a</ref> the robots are starting to cover the environment and, therefore, the coverage error is initially proportional to the importance of the points and their objective. The paths of the top row, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">10a-10d</ref>, represented in magenta, cover the partitions from bottom to top in a sweep-like manner. This demonstrates that the paths go through the points with the highest coverage error. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10e</ref>, almost all the robots have already covered their partitions for the first time. The blue robot needs a little more time since it has the biggest partition. The paths of the robots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">10e</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10f</ref>, fill the gaps that they have previously left uncovered. At this point, the coverage error is already small in the majority of the points. Eventually, in the steady state, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10g-10h</ref>, the robots keep moving to maintain the coverage as close as possible to the objective, paying special attention to the zones where more work is required.</p><p>The performance of our coverage strategy is assessed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">11a</ref>. We depict the mean coverage error and its standard deviation for the simulation. One can see that, at the beginning, when the environment is totally uncovered, the error is around 0.7 due to the importance function. After that, it decreases rapidly and converge to a small steadystate value. In fact, on average, the points have under 7% of error. The standard deviation increases at the beginning because the undercovered points keep deteriorating and some others become slightly overcovered when the robots go over them. However, it also decreases to a small steady-state value around 0.09. A similar tendency persists inside the partitions of the robots as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11b</ref>, where ε(k) is calculated only within P i . Nevertheless, it is interesting to see the differences between the biggest partition, the blue one, and the smaller ones, the magenta and green ones. The error at the beginning in the magenta and green ones is higher because the importance of the points inside them is higher, as opposed to the blue one. On the other hand, the reduction of the error in those partitions is faster because they are smaller and XX(X) the robots need less time to cover them completely. On the contrary, the blue robot needs more time to cover its region and, therefore, its error decreases slower.</p><p>Although the coverage error is the metric that defines the optimality of the coverage, it is difficult to visualize. A more intuitive representation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>. The mean coverage level of the environment increases rapidly towards the mean coverage objective. However, its steady-state value is smaller due to the different importance of the points. This happens because the robots pay more attention to the most important points at the expense of leaving the least important worse covered. For this reason, the mean value lays between the mean coverage objective and the mean coverage objective weighted by the importance. Finally, we show in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref> the number of times that the robots covered each point of the environment. The resemblance with the work map makes it clear that the robots visit more frequently the most important points and those with a lower decay, because the coverage deteriorates faster on them. The undercovered zones near the boundaries between partitions occur due to discretization in the simulation and due to the separation from the boundary to the boundary nodes of the graph. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Comparison with centroidal Voronoi partitions</head><p>To conclude the simulations, we compare the coverage results to those obtained using the Voronoi partition algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cortes et al. (2004)</ref> to generate the partitions of the environment. Both methods have been tested in the Rooms environment, with the work function λ represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. In the Voronoi partition we have used the workload as the density function to compute the centroid of the partition.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref> (a) we show the partitions obtained with the two algorithms for one example of initial conditions of the generators. In this particular example the yellow partition accounts for the 25.64% of the total workload, whereas the black partition only accounts for 15.83%, implying that first robot will need to do considerably more work than the second. In addition, two out of the five partitions are not connected (black and We have repeated this analysis for the 10 runs described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> for this environment to measure the number of disconnected partitions and the difference between the maximum and minimum workload. The Voronoi tessellation method has yielded 16 disconnected regions, as opposed to the zero regions obtained with our method. The mean difference of the 10 trials has been 10.3% with a standard deviation of 1.36.</p><p>In the following, we focus on the coverage quality when both sets of partitions are used together with the path planning algorithm described in Section 5, just for the partitions given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">14 (a)</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14 (b</ref>) we show the coverage graphs and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14 (c</ref>) we show the number of times that each node of the graphs was visited during the experiment. In the Voronoi partitions, some robots invade other robots' partitions in order to move between the disconnected components, e.g., the green partition. More importantly, with the equitable partition, points at the bottom of the map are visited more often, accounting for their decay and importance in a better way.</p><p>Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14 (d</ref>) we show the normalized error (solid lines), eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_85">63</ref>), for each partition and the standard deviation (dashed lines) computed over all the points in the integral. The transient behavior in this case is similar for both partitions, with a slightly better performance, i.e., less settling time, when using the equitable partitions for those regions with high importance (every region but the green one). In the steady state it can be seen that the equitable partition presents a smaller standard deviation, implying a more homogeneous coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Experimental Results</head><p>The final validation of our proposal was performed carrying out real-world experiments in a complex environment shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">16a</ref>. It is composed by a small room in the left side and a main room in the center that connects to a corridor through two different doors. The goal was to persistently cover the environment shown in the same figure in yellow, with N = 3 TurtleBot II robots. †</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Setup</head><p>The multi-robot system was set up relying on the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Quigley et al. (2009)</ref>. The robotics system was organized as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">15</ref>. From XX(X) (a) Environment map. The area to be covered is represented in yellow.  In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17</ref> we show some snapshots of experiment B at three different iterations, k = 0, k = 100 and k = 500. In particular, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">17a</ref> shows the initial position of the robots while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17b</ref> shows the three robots in the main room covering their respective partitions after start-up. Even when the robot associated to the red partition starts outside of its partition, the planner drives it towards it improving the coverage of the other partition while going there. This coverage is taken into account by the planner in the magenta partition. They start sweeping the environment from bottom to top, according to the importance of the points, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17c</ref>. After 500 iterations, the robots have covered almost the entire environment for the first time. This can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17f</ref>. At that point, the blue robot is inside the small room covering the surroundings of the table (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17d</ref>) and the other two are sweeping the corridor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17e</ref>). It is worth highlighting how the coverage of the central and lower part of the main room had already decayed at k = 500, since the were the first covered areas.</p><p>Eventually, we analyze the results from experiments A and B. It can be seen that in both cases they are very similar to the simulation results, which validates our approach for a real system in a complex environment.</p><p>In experiment A the coverage error in the entire environment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">18a</ref>) and in each partition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18b</ref>) decreased rapidly and was maintained at a low value. The mean coverage level was maintained very close to the desired level, with almost the same value as the mean of the objective weighted by the work required at each point (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18c</ref>). This demonstrated that, although the robots could not maintain the desired level all the time because of the nature of the problem, they were able to maintain the most important points closer to their desired value. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18d</ref> depicts the real paths that the robots followed to cover the entire environment the first time.</p><p>In experiment B we decreased the value of the decay to simulate a faster deterioration of the coverage, i.e., to entail the robots a bigger workload and, therefore, forcing them to visit the important points with more frequency. This is equivalent to reducing the team size and deploying less robots than required by the environment. For these reasons, the results show in this case a smaller reduction of the coverage error (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">19a-19b</ref>)), a lower value of the coverage level and a slightly bigger standard deviation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">19c</ref>). The paths followed by the robots demonstrate that they covered several times the lower parts of their partitions, i.e., the most important ones, before covering their upper parts completely. These experiments support the adaptability of our approach to environments with non-uniform workloads and, in particular experiment B, that the robots are able to prioritize the most important areas even if their capabilities are lower than the work required by the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have proposed a partitioning approach based on power diagrams along with a graph-based coverage planning strategy to solve the persistent coverage problem. We have introduced in the first place an algorithm to find the power weights that correspond an equitable partition of the environment. This strategy can be applied to any kind of non-convex environment thanks to the use of the geodesic distance in the partitioning. We have also presented two extensions for this strategy. The first extension drives the generator of each partition to the centroid of the connected component with the highest workload. The objective of this strategy is to reduce the disconnections of the partitions to the extent possible. The second extension takes into account the different coverage capabilities of each robot. In the second place, we have presented an online planning algorithm that allows each robot to locally find the best path in terms of the current coverage error. This algorithm is based on the construction of a path graph that covers the entire partition of the robot with sweep-like paths. We assign the coverage errors of the head nodes to the edge weights and, therefore, the problem reduces to finding the optimal path through a graph, that can be achieved efficiently with state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we include simulation and experimental results to support our contributions and show how our solution can be applied to a real world scenario.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the bottom up, two ROS nodes -Kobuki and Hokuyomanage the TurtleBot II platform equipped with an onboard Intel NUC core i7 computer and a Hokuyo URG-04LX LiDAR sensor. These nodes provide odometry and laser readings to the AMCL node and to the navigation stack. The AMCL node is in charge of localizing the robots on a pre-built map (obtained previously to the experiments) provided by the Map Server node. The navigation stack is, as usual, divided in two layers. At the bottom level, the ORM Minguez (2005) -chosen because its efficacy in dense environments-implements the basic obstacle avoidance capability. On top of the ORM, a dedicated global planner indicated as EPC-GP was used. It wraps the Equitable Partition algorithm described in this paper, which is presently implemented in Matlab (EPC-Matlab). The latter takes advantage of the Matlab robotics toolbox, which allows ROS communication between standalone ROS nodes and Matlab scripts. Specifically the EPC-Matlab publishes the paths computed by the algorithm in a dedicated topic which is read by the EPC-GP, that assumes them as global paths. Also, the EPC-Matlab reads AMCL-computed poses to update the coverage map. From the architectural point of view, the heavier computation was centralized in a single machine: only the Kobuki and Hokuyo nodes ran on the mobile platform computers while the other nodes (3×AMCL, 3×Navigation and 1×Map Server) and the algorithm itself (EPC-Matlab) resided in the base station connected with the robots through a WiFi router.</p><p>The coverage actions and values remained simulated in the experiment due to the complexity associated to measure these values in a real setup. We defined a circular coverage area Ω i of radius r cov i = 0.186m, while the radius of the robots is equal to r i = 0.177m. The speed of the robots were fixed at 0.35 m/s. Their production and the objective functions were the same as in the simulations and the importance of the coverage was Φ = 0.7 + 0.3 q y |Q| y .</p><p>(64)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Results</head><p>In this section we present two runs for different decays. The decay was set to a uniform value of 0.9995 in experiment A and 0.995 in experiment B. The resulting work for experiment A can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">16b</ref> and is proportional for experiment B. The lower part required more work while the corridor required less, due to its lower importance. With these settings, the resulting partitions and path graphs computed by the robots were the ones depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">16c</ref>. In both experiments they were the same since the only difference is a proportional decay. The three partitions were equitable and self-connected with the three robots sharing the main room and two of them sharing the corridor through different doors. The path graph of the each robot covers its entire partition and allows the robot to follow sweep-like paths.</p></div>			</div>
