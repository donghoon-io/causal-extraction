<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Conceptual modeling is almost certainly the most important aspect of a simulation project <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Robinson 2007)</ref>. Conceptual models serve as abstractions of user's perceptions of a system -being either real or proposed. Important purposes of conceptual models are: (1) to foster analyst's understanding of a domain (2) to help developers and users to communicate, (3) to serve as a basis for design, and (4) to serve as documentation of the original requirements of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Kung and Solvberg 1986)</ref>. Clearly, quality of conceptual modeling does influence project management (time scales, organization, iterations), project contents (problem definition, model development, experimenting, validation &amp; verification), and -last but not least -project success in terms of credibility and acceptance of solutions. This makes the creation of a conceptual model one of the crucial jobs of the analyst.</p><p>Conceptual model creation entails two activities: (1) the identification of the phenomena to be modeled and (2) the mapping of the phenomena into grammar's constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wand and Weber 2002)</ref>. In the context of simulation, grammar may refer to diagramming techniques, such as, for example, Petri Nets, activity cycle diagrams, flow charts, and -of course -(graphical) representations following the analyst's own definitions and logic. In this article we will mainly address the first phase of conceptual model creation. Our primary focus will be on guidance for the analyst in the development of the conceptual model.</p><p>In his survey on conceptual modeling for simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Robinson (2007)</ref> distinguishes between three basic approaches in guiding the analyst: principles of modeling, methods of simplification, and modeling frameworks. Principles of modeling advocate an evolutionary development of models -start small and simple, and adapt and extend the model incrementally. On the other hand, methods of simplification work the other way around by suggesting ways for model pruning. While both approaches offer relevant assistance for conceptual modeling they do not apriori address the creation of the conceptual model, i.e., the identification of elementary model components appealing to a domain and to project's stakeholders. Modeling frameworks distinguish themselves from the aforementioned approaches by specifying a procedure for detailing a model in terms of its elements, their attributes and their relationships. Examples include the general case of systems representation and domain related cases. The general case of systems representation anticipates conceptualization building on elementary system elements, i.e., components, including their variables and parameters, and mutual relationships, see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shannon (1975)</ref>. Domain related cases refer primarily to the military field, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Nance (1994)</ref>. Outside this domain, examples are scarce. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Guru and Savory (2004)</ref> address a framework for modeling physical security systems. Also our previous work on a modeling framework for manufacturing systems (Van der Zee and Van der Vorst 2005, Van der Zee 2006) may be included in this category.</p><p>With the exception of the aforementioned modeling frameworks for specific fields of interest, guidance for the analyst's in his creative job of conceptual modeling seems scarce. Not surprisingly, conceptual modeling is often typified as being more of an art than a science. This seems not only true for the simulation field <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Shannon 1975)</ref>, but also for the wider context of systems analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Weber 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Lieberman 2003</ref>). Analyst's "works of art" tend to be guided by their own implicit reference models, concepts underlying diagramming techniques, and the libraries offered by simulation tools. Obviously, next to the skills of the analyst and the tool developer, also the characteristics of the project at hand influence conceptual model quality in terms of an explicit and insightful representation of key decision variables. Here relevant project characteristics include, for example, the available resources, budget restrictions, time horizon, client's interest in modeling, and modeling efforts as they follow from problem complexity.</p><p>Clearly, the "implicit" practice of conceptual modeling has an impact on model quality in terms of its transparency and completeness with respect to key decision variables. Hence, model effectiveness may be impaired. However, also modeling efficiency may be harmed as this implicit practice does not directly contribute to, for example, education, i.e., analysts' or stakeholders' learning from each other experiences, model re-use, and the setup of robust simulation libraries. Moreover, the interest in innovative chain configurations in business, such as for example, supply chains, health care chains, and transportation networks, stress the importance of high quality conceptual modeling. This follows both from systems' complexity, and the presence of multiple autonomous stakeholders. System complexity of chain configurations sets higher demands on an insightful representation of model elements, both for the analyst and the stakeholders -in their strengthened role as domain experts. At the same time the presence of multiple autonomous stakeholders puts pressure on a joint understanding and creation of solutions. This implies the need for a shift from communicative models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balci 1986</ref>) to participative models (Van der Zee 2007).</p><p>In this article we attempt to evaluate the current practice of conceptual modeling for the manufacturing field to some extent. We do so by assessing the choice of model components for diagramming techniques, and simulation tools. We relate this choice of components to their underlying model decomposition principles. Typically, diagramming techniques, and simulation tool libraries are built starting from these principles, which should relate to a specific field of interest. Unhiding these principles is assumed to:</p><p>• Create awareness on the way conceptual modeling may be supported and steered by diagramming techniques and simulation tools. • Assist in understanding applicability and shortcomings of diagramming techniques and simulation tools with respect to conceptual modeling. • Provide an initial set of decomposition principles which may be communicated and applied for practical or educational use. • Establish a preliminary basis for creating, improving and extending conceptual frameworks under-lying simulation tools and diagramming techniques. As a first step in our evaluation we categorize engineering principles underlying conceptual modeling (Section 2). Next, in Section 3, we consider a few well-known diagramming techniques and illustrate their support for conceptual modeling by highlighting their underlying decomposition principles. In a similar way we consider two simulation packages (Section 4). Starting from the observations in Section 3 and 4, in Section 5, we review literature as it critisized tools and models for conceptual richness, and completeness. This results in the identification of an other set of decomposition principles, that is somewhat tailored to the manufacturing field. On the other hand, an explanation is offered for the conceptual model quality as it results from the dominating implicit approach. Section 6 introduces an alternative, structured, approach towards conceptual model engineering. Finally, main conclusions are summarized in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CONCEPTUAL MODEL CREATION -CATEGORIZING ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES</head><p>In this section we briefly categorize principles underlying conceptual model creation. Two cognitive approaches are suggested as being fundamental in the process of identifying the phenomena to be modeled (Burton-Jones and Meso 2006):</p><p>• Decomposition: breakdown of a system into semiindependent components corresponding to its many functional parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Simon 1996</ref>). • Classification: grouping of similar types of objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Parsons 2002)</ref>. Basically, decomposition starts from a top down approach towards modeling, while classification works the other way around. Essentially, classification boils down to an abstraction of similarities among individual things for supporting cognitive economy, inference, and communication, see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Smith and Medin (1981)</ref>.</p><p>Starting from these fundamental approaches other approaches may be adopted to refine model engineering. We mention the principles of modeling, and methods of simplification introduced in Section 1. They may be helpful, in choosing the right amount of detail, and to tailor model scope. Further Liebermann ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) mentions the possibility of obscuring or emphasizing model components. Obviously, the application of suchlike principles assumes a thorough notion of the stakeholders' objectives, both with respect to system analysis and visualization. In this article we restrict ourselves to the evaluation of the fundamental principles for simulation model engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BASIC PRINCIPLES -DIAGRAMMING TECHNIQUES</head><p>Diagramming techniques are often used as the initial (home made) grammar for representing and visualizing a system. Several techniques exist, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pooley (1991)</ref> for a first introduction. In this section we will consider just three of these techniques: Activity Cycle Diagrams, Petri Nets and Flow charts. Reasons for choosing just these techniques lie in the fact that they are well-known, and address the general systems case. With this choice of techniques we aim to contribute to simple and insightful reasoning. For all three techniques multiple implementations existeither formalized in literature or not. Hence, they should be considered as families of techniques, rather than being characterized as stand-alone. In this section we will discuss one specific implementation for each technique.</p><p>As a starting point for our discussion we consider a small case example -a simple job shop. The job shop is modeled by applying each of the three diagramming techniques, and illustrates model component use and meaning, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Next, we consider each technique in somewhat more detail, and unhide their underlying decomposition principles, by inference from their choice of components.</p><p>The job shop may be characterized by three entities: (1) products, arriving according to an irregular pattern, (2) a single machine, capable of processing all types of products, and (3) an operator, being responsible for machine setups. The machine may require maintenance. This need is to be established every time processing for a product has been completed. The machine has to be setup for each individual product. However, machine setups are not sequence dependent, i.e., do not depend on the type of product to be processed. The operator also has specific tasks at other departments.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> represents the job shop by an activity cycle diagram. Activity cycle diagrams make use of two symbols: the dead state, i.e., waiting for some condition to be fulfilled, and the active state, i.e., some activity other than waiting. Activities for each entity are described in terms of a cycle of these states. Relationships between entities follow from their cooperation in active states. For example, the execution of an operation requires the availability of both a product and a machine. Use of Activity cycle diagrams is advocated in case of a system with a strong queueing structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Pidd 1998</ref>).</p><p>An alternative way of modeling of the job shop is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. Here a Petri Nets formalism is used for modeling the job shop. Petri Nets consist of four types of components: (1) movable entities called "tokens", (2) transitions, concerning transformations of tokens, (3) places, for temporarily storing tokens, and (4) arcs, for connecting places and transitions. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, tokens depict products, the machine and the operator, while transitions model shop activities. Further, Petri Nets foresee in an explicit notion of dynamics, i.e., transitions are allowed to execute ("fire") if tokens are available at all its input places. For example, the distribution of tokens in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> allows for a start of the "operation". Note how this rule also implies the need for an additional transition for modeling machine setup. Many alternative choices are described in literature as far as the definition of Petri Nets' components and their dynamics are concerned, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Murata (1989)</ref> for an introduction. Here we consider timed Petri Nets, where times are associated with the duration of a transition.</p><p>Flow charts, or logic flow diagrams, model the logic of the system rather than the process flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Robinson 2004)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> models shop behavior in case of a product arrival, as a sequence of decisions and processes. Note that this is a partial model. Similar diagrams may be developed for the case a machine completes service, a machine has been repaired or setup, and the arrival of an operator.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we give an overview of model components for the three diagramming techniques. We use this overview to infer seven underlying decomposition principles,   Let us now discuss the decomposition principles in somewhat more detail. For Petri Nets, the concept of a system boundary (I) is made explicit. For example, the transition Product arrival acts as a source of products, while the transition Product leaves represents an external entity of type sink. Further, a distinction can be made between movable and non-movable entities (II). Where tokens in Petri Nets depict movable entities, transitions may present infrastructural entities. Remark, that infrastructure is related to the setup of the diagram, not a-priori to the physical or logic underlying the system. Both movable entities and non-movable entities may be further classified as being active, i.e., initiating activities, or passive, i.e., being acted upon (III). Here transitions may be considered active, while places and tokens are passive.</p><p>In both activity cycle diagrams and Petri Nets activities waiting and processing (IV) are distinguished. Recall, how this makes them fit for modeling queueing systems. Alternatively, for flow charts, it is distinguished between decision making and processing (V).</p><p>Relationships between entities follow from their joint participation in activities (VI). They are expressed by arcs. Finally, Petri Nets foresee in an explicit mechanism for representing dynamics, through the "firing" of transitions (VII).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> makes clear how each diagramming technique builds on a subset of decomposition principles. The inclusion of specific decomposition principles may make it more or less fit for specific applications. For example, the explicit notion of decisions may make a flow chart a suitable vehicle for modeling a decision algorithm, but less suitable for modeling process flow. On the other hand, at first sight, Petri Nets may offer advantages in case of a dynamics representation of the system. A more general observation on the use of these diagramming techniques concerns their contextual richness. As they build on a limited set of simple components their size may easily explode for real-life case settings. Consequently, diagrams often have to be enriched with supplemental texts or by modifications, following from the application of additional decomposition or classification principles. Next to model size, also model complexity may hinder practical use. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kamper (1991)</ref>, and Ryan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Heavey (2006)</ref> indicate that for real-istic systems Petri Nets make it difficult for non-experts to reason with the logic contained within the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">TAILORED PRINCIPLES -SIMULATION PACKAGES</head><p>Next to diagramming techniques also simulation tools may guide conceptual modeling. This may happen in an indirect way by relating the development and definition of initial diagrams to the foreseen tool for model coding, as well as in a direct way -in case simulation tools are used as a first basis for setting up preliminary (conceptual) models. In this section we assess underlying decomposition principles for simulation tools. We do so not with the idea of a full coverage of all tools, or even of a single tool. Clearly, the abundance of available simulation packages <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Swain 2005)</ref>, and their individual world view and level of detail hinders this. Rather, we seek to illustrate how simulation tools further detail system decomposition, using an additional set of principles, which is tailored to the field of interest. Therefore we studied just two of these packages: EM-Plant TM and Enterprise Dynamics TM . Both packages are object oriented and are widely applied in manufacturing practice. As findings for both packages are rather similar we condense our discussion here by only highlighting observations on EM-Plant TM .</p><p>To infer basic decomposition principles underlying decomposition principles for EM-Plant TM we studied the components of its so-called basic library, its introductory manual <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Tecnomatix 2003)</ref> and its help function. The basic library is the set of building blocks that is used as a start for all model development, including dedicated librariestailored to a specific field of interest. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows how different types (classes) of entities are foreseen. In turn, each of these classes my be further decomposed in subclasses. Entity descriptions are derived from the definitions supplied by the tool builders. Original definitions are somewhat condensed in order to meet space requirements, and clarity in typifying entities. Note how we do not distinguish between classes and their graphical representation. In principle, class definitions and graphical representations, may concern alternative grammars for conceptualization, for which a one to one mapping is not always guaranteed. As a first step in model decomposition EM-Plant TM distinguishes between three elementary modalities, i.e., types of flow, for manufacturing systems: material flow information flow, and resources, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. For the material flow, further decomposition is realized by applying ba sic principles I-III, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. This is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which relates choice of entities to decomposition principles (in italics). Next, applying the concept of classification, results in a number of subclasses per functional class. For resources a similar set of principles is used. Note how resources are restricted to workers, and their associated infrastructure, and control.</p><p>For the information flow, alternative decomposition principles are applied. Where material flow entities appeal to the physical elements of a manufacturing system, the choice of information flow entities seems to be largely motivated by a general systems focus. This follows from entities, that may be characterized as programming facilities, rather than building blocks tailored to the manufacturing field. Next to the direct access to the internal language, i.e., SimTalk TM , via Methods, there is the explicit notion of data storage in alternative formats. Further, direct manipulation of the event list is foreseen for activating entities, and code, for example, to model shift patterns. Finally, the library contains interfaces with external software. For material flow EM-Plant TM distinguishes between three basic types of activities: production, transport and storage. In principle, most of the fixed units, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, may undertake each of these activities -as made explicit in performance registration. However, initialization for each entity allows for a specific choice of activity. For example, a SingleProc is associated with production, while a Store is related to storage. This implies an initial entity classification. For resources similar types of activities can be distinguished. However, they are restricted to a specific type of resource, i.e., the worker.</p><p>Decision making activities may be directly related to each fixed material flow entity through entrance and exit controls. These controls allow for calling on a method, i.e., code based on the internal language. Also standard or userdefined priority rules for dispatching may be embedded in material flow entities, for example, to sort or route movable entities.</p><p>For information flow there is no clear notion of activities. This follows from the building blocks being programmers' facilities rather than manufacturing systems' elements, also see above.</p><p>Entity relationships may be specified for fixed material flow units. Relationships are founded on the exchange of movable units. Here types of movable units exchanged determine the relationship.</p><p>Basically, model dynamics is related to the input of movable material flow elements at fixed material flow entities. Typically, this starts an activity. Note how activities include the possibility of waiting for a next activity. Other means to start activities are time patterns, for example worker shifts. While time patterns have an explicit notion, being part of the library, also "implicit" access to the event list is possible through model code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF CONCEPTUAL MODEL CREATION</head><p>In previous sections we discussed a few examples of diagramming techniques and their underlying decomposition principles. In this section we relate these initial observations to criticism in literature on manufacturing simulation models' conceptual richness and completeness. We have two objectives in doing so: (1) explain criticism building on a more thorough notion of the creative principles underlying conceptual modeling (2) highlight additional principles that address the criticism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mize et al. (1992)</ref> point at the fact that traditional languages do not provide natural constructs for separately and distinctly modeling the three types of basic functions, i.e., physical, information and control/decision functions. In addition, the constructs provided for information and control are often hard coded and dispersed in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pratt et al., 1994)</ref>. Clearly, this hinders modification and re-use of code. A policy that adheres rather strictly to the "one component-one function" doctrine would suffer less from these drawbacks. In turn this provides a more natural modeling environment as the modeler is forced to think about model elements independently. It is interesting to see how EM-Plant TM distinguishes between modalities. However, the notion of the information flow -and especially -the decision flow is weak -leaving conceptual modeling to the model builder rather than offering guidance.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lefrancois and Montreuil (1994)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lefrancois et al. (1996)</ref> a distinction between intelligent and non-intelligent entities permits a more natural and richer presentation and implementation of systems modeled. In such a context, intelligent beings are modeled as agents. Agents are used to implement decision rules inherent to manufacturing system planning and control. Examples include routines for scheduling, dispatching and releasing jobs for a machine or department. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lefrancois and Montreuil (1994)</ref>, and Lefrancois et al.  <ref type="bibr">(1996)</ref> workstations and work orders, are assumed to be non-intelligent. Note how their work assumes a further detailing of the concept of passive and active entities with respect to decision making. Such detail is not met by the diagramming techniques and simulation tools studied here.</p><p>Van der Zee and Van der Vorst (2005) stress the separate and explicit notion of activities in simulation modeling. They advocate to denominate all activities -including information processing and decision-making -in the manufacturing system as "jobs" The job concept is meant to bring two important advantages. Firstly, the use of this common denominator for all activities will provide a clear and natural mechanism for event scheduling, where events are related to the start and the completion of jobs. Secondly, an explicit notion and allocation of company activities, increases visibility and traceability of decision variables. Note how the modeling of decision logistics and supportive information processing is left largely to the analyst. Only basic support is offered for common dispatching rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION -OFFERING STRUCTURE IN CONCEPTUAL MODEL CREATION</head><p>The evaluation of diagramming techniques and simulation tools with respect to their conceptual backing brings us: (1) an initial insight in principles for model decomposition and classification, and (2) the logic of their application in terms of model completeness, and richness. Clearly, the explicit notion of such principles has a direct value for educating simulation engineers in setting up conceptual models. Moreover, it points at the need for a structured approach towards conceptual model creation, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. 1. Domain analysis, resulting in definitions of principles for model decomposition and classification. 2. Framing, i.e., combining principles to develop a conceptual framework for defining model entities, activities, relationships, and their dynamics. 3. The conceptual framework should be the basis for defining a grammar, i.e., a technique supporting an explicit (graphic) model notion. 4. Model building, i.e., the application of the grammar for a specific case example. At the same time, the figure clarifies the current implicit practice in terms of a pragmatic bypass of the aforementioned steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>In this article we considered guidance for the analyst in his job of conceptual model creation. Starting from the observation that domain specific guidance in this respect is scarce, we evaluated a few basic diagramming techniques and simulation tools for their underlying principles for model decomposition and classification. Where literature critisizes manufacturing simulation models for conceptual richness and completeness, unhiding these principles helps in an in-depth explanation and adjustment of their shortcomings. Moreover, the explicit notion of principles for conceptual creation may be helpful in simulation engineering education. It is suggested that such an education should include a more structured approach towards conceptual model engineering. Such an approach distinguishes itself from many of the current implicit approaches, which may be characterized by a "pragmatic bypass" of key phases in conceptual model structuring, i.e., the isolation of relevant principles for conceptual model engineering, and their framing (combination) to make up a complete and rich conceptual framework underlying model grammar.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Diagrams for job shop example</figDesc></figure>
