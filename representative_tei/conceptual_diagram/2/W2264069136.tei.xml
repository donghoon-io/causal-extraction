<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Supply chain engineering requires a design that possesses the flexibility of a complex adaptive system, consisting of interlinking architecture, with external dimensions and system germane internal elements. The aim of this paper is to critically analyse the key supply chain concepts and approaches, to assess the fit between the research literature and the practical issues of supply chain architecture, design and engineering. The objective is to develop a methodology for strategy engineering, which could be used by practitioners when integrating supply chain architecture and design. Taxonomic scheme is applied to consider criteria for strategy architecture, hierarchical strategy integration design, strategy engineering, and integration of supply chain as a conceptual system. The results from this paper derived with the findings that the relationship between supply chain architecture, design and engineering is weak, and challenges remain in the process of adapting and aligning operations. This paper derived with a novel approach for addressing these obstacles, through a conceptual framework diagram and a new methodology, based on the taxonomic scheme. The novelty that derives from this paper is an engineering design methodology for integrating supply chain architecture and design, with criteria that enable decomposing and building a green-field (new and non-existent) supply chain as a system. The taxonomic scheme revealed a number of tools and mechanism, which enabled the development of a new methodology for engineering integrated architecture and design. The review derived with improvements to current and existing theories for analysing interdependencies within and between their individual contexts. This issue is addressed with a hierarchical method for network design, applied for building and combining the integration criteria. The resulting methodology is field tested through a case study with the slate mining industry in North Wales.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Research Objectives</head><p>The research problems investigated are related to engineering the integration of supply chain architecture and design. The research objectives are: 1. To derive with a set of principles for a green-field supply chain architecture with multiple supply chain participants.</p><p>2. To derive with set of principles for green-field supply chain integration design.</p><p>3. To systematically integrate the supply chain engineering principles, based on the architecture and design criteria, for individual activities towards pre-defined green-field integration areas.</p><p>To relate the criteria to the methodology, the taxonomic scheme is presented in a hierarchical concept map and concept diagram methods are applied. The objectives of the paper are oriented around external and salient dimensions, which directly affect the supply chain architecture, and design, and the supply chain engineering consist of external and internal elements, forces and factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Structure of the paper</head><p>This paper is structured in the following order: firstly the research aim and objectives are defined, along with the rationale for the study; secondly, the literature review outlines the most prominent models and methods in this field; thirdly: the reasoning behind key tenants of the methodology are discussed in detail, with specific observations from existing literature on this topic; fourthly, the methodology that derived from this study is presented, followed by the principles key, containing the key tenets and abbreviations. The fourth step also relates the key tenets to existing literature and elaborates on the benefits from the methodology to practitioners and academics; and finally, the emerging principles are analysed to clarify how the key tenets are applied to the new methodology for engineering green-field supply chain architecture and design. To clarify how the methodology can be interpreted and applied, the methodology is field-tested through case study on the Slate Mining Industry in North Wales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>The literature review reveals the most prominent literature and outlines the tools and mechanisms that enabled this paper to derive with the principles for engineering green-field supply chain integration. The objective of the literature review is to analyse the key tenets that enable the architecture for inter-relating the design of supply chain operations.</p><p>Recent literature addressed the aspect of reformulating existing supply chains when problems emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Nikulin, et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Melnyk et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Perez-Franco 2010)</ref>. However, those studies ignored the vast list of measurements in existing literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Van der Vaart and van Donk, 2008)</ref> and the diverse external dimensions and the elements, factors and forces that are present in different environments <ref type="bibr">(Radanliev, 2015a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nikulin, et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Melnyk et al., (2013)</ref>, and Perez-Franco (2010) addressed the aspect of re-engineering, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Van der Vaart and van Donk, (2008)</ref> defined the re-engineering strategic patterns. Nevertheless, the topic of formulating a supply chain strategy as a green-field concept, remains elusive and most of the closely related frameworks <ref type="bibr">(Radanliev, 2015b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Schnetzler et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Hafeez, et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, and Pettigrew, 1977)</ref> have never advanced into full working methodologies, defining the engineering in a step by step supply chain engineering design.</p><p>There is much confusion in existing supply chain literature on terminologies defining re-engineering and engineering <ref type="bibr">(Radanliev, 2015c)</ref>. Terms such as supply chain engineering, design or architecture are commonly used in supply chain re-engineering studies, effectively referring to re-designing. The research in this paper distances from the aspect of re-engineering and is focused on the engineering of non-existent supply chains in a green-field context. Therefore, the term green-field is a clarification concept referring to non-existent supply chains, in other words, the field is green, and there is nothing there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</head><p>The research methodology applied in this paper was taxonomy of approaches from literature review. The selected papers have been related to supply chain strategy, distancing from supply chain management. Recent literature clearly separated between the topics of supply chain management and supply chain strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Perez-Franco et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Schnetzler et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Martínez-Olvera and Shunk, 2006)</ref>. Supply chain management has been defined as the process of transforming materials into a finished product, presenting a long term objective where validation should expand over a long period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Saad et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Mentzer et al., 2001)</ref>. The supply chain strategy was considered as an investigation into how the supply chain should operate efficiently to compete, by evaluating costs, benefits and trade-offs in the supply chain operational components <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Perez-Franco et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Schnetzler et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Martínez-Olvera and Shunk, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In exception of a few cases, the papers have been selected with a research time horizon over the last 10 years <ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>, covering literature published on the topic of supply chain strategy engineering. A limited number of most prominent papers from earlier literature have also been reviewed, because of their specific contribution to the topic of green-field supply chain strategy engineering.</p><p>By distancing from the area of supply chain management, the number of relevant papers was reduced dramatically. This focused the review of literature specific to the engineering aspect of a supply chain strategy, and building a methodology for green-field supply chain strategy engineering.</p><p>Over seventy papers have been reviewed, covering empirical techniques (case/field study, survey, archival research, action research, conceptual models) or modelling techniques (optimisation, simulation, algorithms, systems). What united all the papers reviewed is their singular focus on supply chain strategy, was identified as a topic far less covered in existing literature than supply chain management.</p><p>Multiple methods have been used to search for appropriate literature, to provide transparency, and to reduce risk of missing out on important literature. The databases used include the Web of Science and the Business Source Complete. In addition, Google Scholar was used to ensure the literature selected provides a wide coverage of the topic. The initial results produced more results than a single study can handle. The process of selecting the most pertinent literature involved applying selection criteria. The selection criteria are based on deriving with keywords and scanning first the titles for those word. Secondly, the selected literature was further reduced by scanning the abstract to ensure direct relevance to the topic.</p><p>The complexity of the subject, the multiple environments, dimensions, elements and concepts, required a research that does not set any limits to categorising the conceptual, analytical or empirical nature of the existing approaches. Many of the approaches identi-fied in literature are focused on resolving singular supply chain problems, and are not relating to other aspects of supply chain engineering. This presented the rational for applying a taxonomic scheme to investigate, interrelate and group the attitudes, practices and patterns, present in existing literature on the topics of supply chain: engineering, integration, architecture and design. The taxonomic scheme enabled categorising concepts into different clusters.</p><p>The categorisation enabled the process of recognising, differentiating and understanding different attitudes, practices and patterns for engineering supply chain strategy, and interrelating them in accordance to positive relationships between different concepts.</p><p>But in general, many of the studies have hardly built on previous work. The taxonomic scheme enabled combing and pairing factors and elements from different papers, because they were based on the same aspect of research, and discussed the same constructs and items in terms of supply chain strategy engineering. As a result of the taxonomic scheme, the analysis derived with the most prominent attitudes, patterns, and practices for supply chain engineering, and the interactions, or interrelationships between these factors.</p><p>The synthesised knowledge is then applied for building a methodology integrating the approaches in existing literature on supply chain strategy engineering.</p><p>The papers have been analysed around a taxonomy of characteristics, to map and evaluate green-field supply chain strategy engineering. The different approaches have been categorised in hierarchical methodology.</p><p>The case study method was applied to field-test the resulting methodology on formulating a green-field supply chain strategy for the Slate Mining Industry in North Wales.</p></div>

These are critically appraised above, with specific observations against each approach, to identify limitations and areas applicable to designing a methodology for green-field supply chain strategy engineering. The taxonomy of literature resulted in identifying, categorising and cataloguing the main themes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) necessary for generating a new methodology.</p><p>The methodology is transcribed into a concept diagram (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), before the findings from the taxonomy of literature are summarised into building blocks, and drawn into diagram of problems related to practical aspects of supply chain engineering (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The concept diagram and the building blocks are related to the identified gaps in existing literature.</p><p>The process of categorising, cataloguing and relating the key tenets from existing literature enabled the development of a new methodology (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The approach is compliant with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eisenhardt (1989)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Yin (2009)</ref> guidance on theory building. The methodology contains different aspects, which interrelate to define and interpret the process of engineering a green-field supply chain integration strategy. Different aspects of the taxonomy are interrelated to define the methodology. Interrelated aspects are interpreted in the following building blocks.</p><p>In the supply chain engineering methodology, the architecture of a green-field project integration strategy is interpreted as: articulation of the external dimensions, elements, forces and factors out of the control of the business and supply chain strategy. The critical analysis of the factors and problems derived with emerging categories of external dimensions, elements, forces and factors.</p><p>The methodology interrelates the architecture, through evaluating salient dimensions in relation to the external elements, forces and factors. In the process of interrelating these aspects, different problems emerge from the salient dimensions in relation to the external elements, forces and factors. The taxonomy of approaches determined the importance of dimensions, elements, forces and factors in relation to key tenets for green-field strategy integration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The priority of the supply chain engineering methodology is placed on designing a method for systematic prioritising of activities towards green-field inte-gration areas. The design aspect is defined through applying the key tenets (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), to designing hierarchical concept map (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), for identifying and organising individual operational activities towards integrated supply chain strategy engineering.</p><p>The second aspect of the methodology is the designing of evaluation criteria for the integrated supply chain strategy. The priority of this aspect of the design was, to investigate how conflict of interests can be identified and eliminated. This was addressed though designing a diagram interrelating the con-cepts that emerged from the taxonomy of approaches (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The objective of the diagram was to enable supply chain participants to visualise individual business objectives and gaps in interrelating the supply chain strategy. The diagram should be interpreted in individual context of the supply chain scenario in accordance to the concepts defined in the taxonomy (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The design of conceptual diagram related to the specific supply chain scenarios, enables visualising individual activities and gaps in integration of supply chain operations, specific to individual supply chain activities. </p></div>

The conceptual framework</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining the conceptual framework diagram and the methodology</head><p>The conceptual framework diagram (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) represents the supply chain architecture and integration design, and is based on supply chain activities identified in existing literature and presented in a taxonomic scheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The architecture and design relates the activities to the predetermined supply chain integration areas from the taxonomic scheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). These are evaluated with combining the evaluation criteria from existing literature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and interrelated to the conceptual framework (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> represents the architecture and design, and the gaps that are identified in literature. Those gaps represent problems that could create negative effects on green-field supply chain engineering. Thus, they need to be addressed in a systematic process when engineering the green-field supply chain strategy. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> represents that systematic process for supply chain engineering, and should be interpreted as the process for interrelating the attitudes, practices and patterns present in existing literature. The full list of attitudes, patters, and practices is outlined in the taxonomic scheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>An important conclusion based on the taxonomic scheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) is that there is little consensus on how to engineer green-field supply chain strategy integration, or on how to measure the effects of supply chain architecture on integration and performance. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we take this concern as a starting point to create a conceptual framework diagram from existing research studies on the topic of supply chain architecture and design. In the Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the findings derived from the taxonomic scheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are applied as a discussion focused on the interrelationships between the various supply chain strategic factors, on the relationship between supply chain architecture and design, and on the attitudes, practices and patterns that have an impact on supply chain engineering.</p><p>Examining the relationship between supply chain architecture and design, without concrete set of evaluation criteria of the interrelationships between the different supply chain engineering factors, seems inconclusive. Given the complex interactions between attitudes, patterns and practices, outlined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, it seems necessary to take into account these interactions when investigating the process of engineering supply chain architecture and design.</p><p>For example, one would anticipate an interaction between architecture (e.g. external elements, factors and forces) and practices (e.g. corporate strategy). Similarly, we would expect there to be a relationship between corporate strategy and the integrated business strategy. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GAP11</head><p>In line with the finding from the taxonomic scheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), it seems logical, especially from a conceptual point of view, to focus on systematically engineering the holistic supply chain, by focusing on the interrelationship between supply chain architecture and integration design in individual context. Many authors instead focus on individual problems in individual context. It is not sufficient to have a solution to one problem and to ignore other supply chain problems. The objective of methodology (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) is to systematically address multiple problems in the same time. The methodology (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) measures the interrelationships within a single relationship and then to relate the supply chain engineering of the architecture and design. The advantage of relating individual interrelationships is that it is relatively easy to acquire reliable, evaluation criteria for single interrelationship. By doing that, it becomes clearer about what is exactly being engineered (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and interrelated to the multiple relationships (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>To ensure validity of these findings, the methodology is field tested with a case study of the Mining Industry. Before field testing the methodology, a set of six principles are defined. The set of principles enable academics and practitioners to interrelate different aspects of the methodology and to help them in interpreting Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field testing the new methodology with a case study</head><p>The case study was performed on the Slate Mining Industry in North Wales (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), to formulate a green-field supply chain strategy, integrating the complete supply chain. The case study included a Slate Mining Quarry, Civil Engineering Company, Logistics Company, Rail Terminal Company, Wholesalers (Virtual Quarries) and Retailers (Gardening and Building Materials Shops). The final result of the engineering is expressed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, detailing how different aspect are interrelated in practice and interpreting the practical contributions from the methodology.</p><p>The supply chain engineering in the case study was performed by applying the methodology and assembling the Pugh controlled convergence (PuCC) conceptual design <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pugh, 1990)</ref>, in combination with the mechanisms for capturing, evaluating and reformulating a supply chain strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Perez-Franco et al. 2010</ref>). These methods are applied in combination with: the supply chain design decomposition pyramidal arrangements <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Schnetzler et al., 2007</ref>) and the engineering system dynamics for supply chain design <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hafeez et al., 1996)</ref>.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p>The attention of many researchers outlined in this paper, has often focused on a single area of supply chain strategy. They have generally neglected research on the whole performance of the supply chain strategy engineering, which includes the architecture and design aspects. Considering these gaps, this paper established a methodology, which used the concept of strategic decision making levels and supply chain integration processes, as the approach to the study of the holistic supply chain strategy engineering. In the theory generation stages, the methodology was designed towards green-field strategy engineering for integrating multiple participants. The concept of green-field integration sets this apart from existing methods, which are designed to re-formulate existing strategies of individual companies.</p><p>The implications of this study are focused on the strategic operational activities, and on avoiding prescriptive and descriptive approaches, and addressed the operationalisation aspects of supply chain engineering. While validating the methodology with a case study, the methodology guided the development of integrated strategy, and addressed multiple supply chain complexities, which represented testing the theory in a real life phenomenon with multiple variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>The paper revealed a new methodology for engineering, architecting, and designing integrated green-field supply chain. The methodology derived with the conclusion that green-field supply chain architecture, design and engineering represents a dynamic process, and should be analysed in individual contexts. The critical summary of literature reviewed resulted in identifying the main themes in a summary map (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), necessary for generating a new methodology (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The main themes are categorised in key tenants (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The key tenants are catalogued for addressing several problems present in engineering the architecture and design of green-field supply chains. These are critically appraised, with specific observations, to identify and catalogue the key tenants that function as principles for building the methodology.</p><p>The hierarchical method for network design was applied for building and combining the architecture, design and engineering criteria. This approach was supported with principles from DSCHT, and combined with the techniques from ATC. The new principles contribute to knowledge with: (1) architecting the supply chain elements from multiple supply chain participants;</p><p>(2) designing the participants' main aims and objectives, and (3) engineering the process of getting from the present to the required stage. The supply chain principles are also aimed at anticipating operational capabilities through internal competencies and by considering inter-organisational integration in combination with operations re-engineering.</p><p>The concept verification applied architecture and integration criteria as a method for strategy engineering. The new methodology enables building upon the supply chain engineering criteria that until present, has not been built upon and combined with the process engineering design criteria: visibility, acceptance, participation, communication, adaptability, integration, effectiveness, flexibility, and responsiveness. Combining the criteria represents a holistic approach for supply chain architecture and result in deriving new understandings of green-field supply chain engineering that can be applied by supply chain practitioners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Limitations and future research</head><p>The methodology contributes to and enriches the existing literature and provides background for further academic research in this subject. However, this methodology was verified with a single case study on the mining industry, and while it is anticipated that the proposed methodology is suitable for other sectors, the findings would need to be delimited through further testing and research.</p><p>Further research is required into the topic of addressing strategy absence. In scenarios of high strategy absence the engineering and evaluation criteria of this methodology would be difficult to implement. In that respect, the main challenge for future research is in extracting supply chain strategy tacit knowledge and converting it into explicit. There is a strong preference in practice towards desired over feasible objectives. This issue becomes one of a degree in an integration, because of avoidance of criticism, conflict, disagreement, and controversy. Future research studies should be aware that these challenges.</p></div>
