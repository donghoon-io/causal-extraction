<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the field of bioinformatics and precision medicine, the processing of gene expression data stands as a cornerstone for developing advanced disease early diagnosis systems. The intricate relationship between gene expression patterns and disease phenotypes offers a fertile ground for exploring novel diagnostic approaches. This exploration is particularly critical given the rising prevalence of complex diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, which pose significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. The actuality of improving gene expression data processing methodologies is underscored by the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficacy of disease diagnosis, ultimately leading to more personalized and effective treatment strategies.</p><p>Currently, numerous scientific studies are focused on developing various disease diagnosis systems based on gene expression data. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> the authors tackle the pressing issues posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on the lack of early diagnosis methods and comprehensive treatment solutions. By collecting key genes associated with COVID-19 and applying centrality and controllability analysis within Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and disease-related signalling pathways, the study identifies crucial hub and driver genes that play a significant role in the disease's formation and progression. The study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> delves into the crucial link between epigenetics and the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients by constructing a predictive model that assesses the treatment potential of epigenetic factors in CRC, utilizing gene expression data and identifying prognosis-related epigenetic genes through comprehensive analyses. The study successfully establishes a risk score model based on eight epigenetic-related genes, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting CRC patient outcomes in both training and validation sets, and further integrates it with clinical characteristics to enhance prognostic predictions and suggest targeted therapeutic approaches. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , the authors focus on identifying key genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing microarray datasets to pinpoint differentially expressed genes (DEGs), employing bioinformatics tools for Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment, and constructing a protein-protein interaction network to isolate hub genes, whose predictive value was further validated through principal component analysis and histological examination of an AD mouse model. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , the authors delve into personalized therapy strategies for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) patients by analyzing gene expression profiles and inflammation-related phenotypes to identify characteristic genes and lncRNAs linked to LIHC prognosis, subsequently developing a machine learning-based prognostic model, the Inf-PR model, which demonstrates superior predictive accuracy over traditional prognostic factors and existing models through ten-fold cross-validation. The model not only differentiates drug sensitivity and immune targets across prognostic risk groups, revealing distinct responses to FDA-approved drugs like lovastatin, sorafenib, doxorubicin, and lenvatinib, but also suggests that high-risk patients may benefit more from combining treatment with immunotherapy, offering a novel, individualized precision approach to augment current LIHC treatments. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , the authors investigate diabetic kidney disease (DKD), the deadliest complication of diabetes, by focusing on diverse programmed cell death (PCD) pathways as key indicators of renal function decline and potential drug research targets, utilizing microarray and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data to identify and analyze the activity of 13 PCD-related genes across different renal cell types. Through extensive analysis, including gene set variation and weighted gene co-expression network analysis, four core PCD pathways (entotic cell death, apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis) were identified and linked to significant roles in DKD progression, culminating in the development of a cell death-related signature (CDS) risk score that effectively predicts DKD diagnosis, immune cell infiltration levels, and glomerular filtration rates, underscoring the potential of these pathways as therapeutic targets.</p><p>Despite certain achievements in using gene expression data for disease diagnosis and treatment, significant challenges remain in early diagnosis, treatment personalization, model validation, and therapeutic target identification. Addressing these challenges requires integrated approaches that combine genetic data with clinical insights, advanced computational models, and thorough validation studies. The unsolved parts of the general problem include:</p><p>• There is a continuous need for the development of methods that can diagnose diseases at an earlier stage, as highlighted by the study on COVID-19. Early diagnosis is crucial for diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, where early intervention can significantly alter the prognosis.</p><p>• Identifying gene expression patterns that can guide comprehensive treatment strategies, including personalized therapy approaches, remains a challenge. Studies on colorectal cancer and liver hepatocellular carcinoma have made strides in linking gene expression with treatment options, but a gap exists in translating these findings into universally effective therapies.</p><p>• Effectively integrating genetic data with traditional clinical characteristics to enhance prognostic predictions and therapeutic decisions is still a developing area. While some studies have begun to integrate these aspects, a more cohesive approach is needed across different diseases.</p><p>• While predictive models based on gene expression data have shown promise, increasing their accuracy, validating them across diverse populations, and ensuring they are applicable in clinical settings remain areas for further exploration.</p><p>• The effective use of varied data types, such as single-nucleus RNA sequencing data and microarray data, in disease diagnosis and the development of treatment strategies is an ongoing challenge. The ability to integrate and analyze these diverse data types to provide coherent insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses needs further development.</p><p>The rationale behind the integrated use of gene ontology analysis, cluster and bicluster analysis, and deep learning techniques in addressing this challenge is multifaceted. Firstly, gene ontology analysis provides a structured framework for interpreting gene expression data, enabling the identification of biological processes and pathways that are most relevant to the disease under investigation. This relevance is crucial for narrowing down the vast array of genomic data to actionable insights. Secondly, cluster and bicluster analysis techniques facilitate the segmentation of gene expression data into meaningful groups or biclusters, where genes within a group exhibit similar expression patterns across a subset of conditions or samples. This segmentation is instrumental in uncovering the complex relationships between genes and disease phenotypes, which are often not linear and involve interactions among multiple genes. Finally, deep learning techniques offer the computational power and sophistication required to model these complex relationships, providing the ability to predict disease presence or progression with high accuracy based on gene expression profiles.</p><p>One of the primary challenges in the field of gene expression data processing is the high dimensionality of the initial experimental data, which complicates the identification of meaningful patterns and relationships. Additionally, the heterogeneity of disease mechanisms often results in subtle and complex gene expression changes, making it difficult to distinguish between disease states. Moreover, many current systems lack the integration of comprehensive biological knowledge, such as gene ontology, into the analysis process, which can limit the interpretability and biological relevance of the findings. The actuality of research in this subject area is further magnified by the ongoing need to overcome these limitations and harness the full potential of gene expression data for disease diagnosis. An integrated approach that combines gene ontology analysis, sophisticated clustering techniques, and deep learning models holds the promise of transcending these barriers, paving the way for the development of next-generation diagnostic systems. Such systems would not only offer improved diagnostic accuracy but also contribute to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms at the molecular level, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and personalized medicine approaches.</p><p>The main contributions of the research are the following:</p><p>• We introduce a novel hybrid model that integrates gene ontology analysis, cluster-bicluster analysis, and deep learning methods, which can allow us to enhance the precision and objectivity of diagnosing complex diseases based on gene expression data.</p><p>• A conceptual description and a detailed flowchart of a step-by-step procedure for processing gene expression data have been developed and presented.</p><p>• A hybrid model of optimal hyperparameter values determination based on the integrated use of the Bayes optimization algorithm, cluster-bicluster analysis and convolutional neural network has been proposed.</p><p>• The practical implementation of the proposed technique has been performed using real-world gene expression data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and cancer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the block diagram of the model for gene expression data processing. Its implementation involves the following stages:</p><p>1. Formation and preprocessing of gene expression data. 2. Data filtering and formation of subsets of significant and co-expressed genes.</p><p>2.1. Application of gene ontology analysis for removing insignificant genes considering the type of biological organism and the number of genes determining the object's state. The threshold value can vary for different data within the range from 95% (p-value = 0.05) to 99% (p-value = 0.01), depending on the set goal and obtained results.</p><p>2.2. Clustering of gene expression profiles using the Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the clustering algorithm hyperparameters. Within the framework of our research, we applied the Self Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA) with a correlation metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , which is focused on clustering high-dimensional data, including gene expression profiles.</p><p>2.3. Bicluster analysis of gene expression data allocated into clusters using the ensemble biclustering algorithm 8 , the optimal hyperparameters of which are also determined using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the ensemble biclustering algorithm for gene expression data processing was justified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Formation of biclusters of coherent gene expression data for each subset of data formed at the previous step of this procedure. The second stage of data filtration involves applying gene ontology analysis to the data in formed biclusters to identify the most significant ontologies, taking into account the nature of grouping of both the genes and samples in the allocated biclusters. The next step involves identifying vectors of identifiers for significant genes for each ontology. The final step entails creating unique gene identifiers for each biclustering, followed by the formation of subsets of significant and mutually correlated gene expression data for each cluster.</p><p>3. Classification of objects, the attributes of which are the formed subsets of significant and mutually expressed genes. 4. Analysis of the obtained results.</p><p>4.1. Analysis of intermediate decisions for forming a final decision on the state of the object by evaluating the consistency of classification results of samples across different subsets of gene expression data. In this case, the state of the object is considered to be unambiguously identified if the classification results across different data sets are consistent. Otherwise, the state of the object is considered undetermined, requiring further clinical studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality criteria for assessing the results of clustering, biclustering and classification</head><p>As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, a key aspect of the effective application of the proposed model is the optimization of the model's hyperparameters used at the respective stage of the aforementioned procedure. Within the framework of our research, this procedure is carried out using the Bayesian optimization algorithm, the efficient use of which requires the application of a targeted objective function, the maximum value of which corresponds to the optimal combination of hyperparameters. The simulation results have shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> that, in the case of applying gene expression data, the most suitable metric for assessing the proximity of gene expression profiles is based on the evaluation of mutual information (MI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">MI(X,Y ) = ∑ x∈X ∑ y∈Y p(x, y)log( p(x, y) p(x)p(y) )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where: X, Y are vectors between which the MI assessment is performed; p(x, y) is the joint probability distribution of X and Y ; p(x) and p(y) are the marginal probability distributions.</p><p>Mutual information is a measure of the shared information between two vectors of random variables, but it is not inherently a distance metric. The transformation of MI value into a distance can be performed in various ways. Within the framework of our research, a metric based on Shannon entropy was applied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d(X,Y ) = H(X) + H(Y ) -2MI(X,Y )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where H(X) and H(Y ) are the Shannon entropy values of vectors X and Y respectively. In this case, if two identical data distributions are considered, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H(X) = H(Y ) = MI(X,Y ) and d(X,Y ) = 0.</formula><p>As the difference between the data distributions increases, the value of mutual information decreases, leading to an increase in the distance between these vectors. Clustering quality criteria should consider both the nature of the distribution of gene expression profiles within clusters relative to the median (since the average value of all expression values is an abstraction and does not correspond to the real distribution of expression values in the profile) and the nature of the distribution of clusters (medians of the respective clusters) in the feature space. Within the framework of our research, the first component of the internal criterion was calculated as the root mean square value of the distances from the gene expression profiles to the median of the cluster where these profiles are located:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">QCW = 1 m K ∑ k=1 m k ∑ i=1 d(e i , M k ) 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where: d(e i , M k ) is the distance calculated based on mutual information estimation; e i is the vector of expression values of the i-th gene; M k is the median of the k-th cluster; m is the total number of gene expression profiles; m k is the number of gene expression profiles in cluster k; K is the number of clusters.</p><p>A smaller value of the criterion component (3) corresponds to a higher density of gene expression profiles in the allocated clusters. The second component of the internal criterion was calculated as the root mean square value of the distances between all pairs of medians in the clusters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">QCB = 2 k(K -1) K-1 ∑ i=1 K ∑ j=1+1 d(M i , M j ) 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>It should be noted that better clustering corresponds to a smaller distance between gene expression profiles within individual clusters and a greater distance between separate clusters (maximum value of criterion ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>)). Considering the above, the formula for calculating the internal criterion can be presented as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">QC cl = QCW K • QCB (5)</formula><p>where the number of clusters K acts as a sort of "normalizing" coefficient, meaning that formula (5) determines the average density of the distribution of gene expression profiles and the medians of the respective clusters relative to a single cluster. A smaller value of the criterion (5) corresponds to better clustering according to this criterion. The calculation of the internal criterion value for assessing the coherence of a bicluster involves estimating the average distance both among rows and among columns of the bicluster. The step-by-step procedure for calculating this criterion includes the following steps:</p><p>1. Calculation of the average distance between all pairs of rows in the bicluster:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">QC row = 2 nrow × (nrow -1) nrow-1 ∑ i=1 nrow ∑ j=i+1 d(X i , X j )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>2. Calculation of the average distance between all pairs of columns in the bicluster:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">QC col = 2 ncol × (ncol -1) ncol-1 ∑ i=1 ncol ∑ j=i+1 d(Y i ,Y j )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>3. Calculation of the average value of criteria ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) and (7):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">QC bicl = QC row + QC col 2<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The minimum value of the criterion (8) corresponds to the maximum level of coherence of the bicluster. Since the Bayesian optimization algorithm operates on the principle of maximization, negative values of criteria ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>) were used when determining the optimal hyperparameter values of the respective algorithm in the creation of the target objective function.</p><p>In the optimization of the object classification algorithm based on selected gene expression data, classification accuracy was used as the objective function, calculated on a subset of data for model validation. Initially, the data were divided into two subsets in a 0.7/0.3 ratio. The first subset was used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the classifier and for training the model. The second subset was used for testing the model and assessing its adequacy by calculating the relevant quality criteria of classification. The training of the model, both during the application of the Bayesian optimization algorithm and when training the model with optimal hyperparameter values, was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation. The control of overfitting was performed by analyzing the convergence of average values of classification accuracy and loss functions, calculated on the data for training and validation of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application of gene ontology analysis for forming subsets of significant genes</head><p>At this stage of the research, an analysis of gene ontology was applied to the formed gene expression data using the ANOVA test (analysis of variance between and within groups), functions of the TopGO package, and the comprehensive application of Fisher's and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for the final formation of a list of significant gene identifiers. The implementation of this procedure involves the following steps:</p><p>1. Data preparation and formation of a list of gene identifiers.</p><p>2. Installation and download of necessary packages. Within the current research, the "TopGO" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and "org.Hs.eg.db" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> packages from the "bioconductor" module <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> of the R programming environment were used.</p><p>3. Performing the ANOVA test to identify genes that show significant changes in expression levels between different groups (classes).</p><p>4. Application of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method to correct the p-values obtained in the previous step, which helps to minimize the type I error when forming the list of significant gene identifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Use of the TopGO package functions (Tool for the Ontological Analysis and Visualization of Differential Gene Expression</head><p>Data) for gene ontology analysis, employing the BP ontology -biological processes, and the list of gene identifiers from the "org.Hs.eg.db" package, corresponding to the human genome (Homo Sapiens). The probability threshold (p-value) for distinguishing significant from non-significant genes was set empirically, taking into account the type of data being studied.</p><p>6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental gene expression data used in the modelling process</head><p>During the simulation process, gene expression data of patients examined for Alzheimer's disease and various types of cancer were used. The data was obtained through the application of different technologies that allow us the assess the effectiveness of the proposed model for various types of data. The gene expression data of patients examined for Alzheimer's disease were obtained through DNA microarray experiments, while the gene expression data examined for various types of cancer were obtained using the RNA sequencing method. All types of data included gene expression data of patients for whom the respective disease was identified based on the results of clinical studies, as well as patients for whom the disease was not detected.</p><p>The first type of experimental data contained the results of gene expression analysis in the human brain, performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and age-related neurological disorders. The GSE5281 data are publicly available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and contain 161 samples taken from three Alzheimer's disease brain centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Gene expression profiling was performed on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array, with each array containing 54,674 transcripts. The formation of the gene expression array was achieved by implementing background correction with the 'rma' method, normalization using the 'quantiles' normalization method, PM correction with the 'mas' method, and summarization using the 'avgdiff' method. Data annotation analysis revealed that Alzheimer's disease was not detected in 74 patients. In this case, the data can be divided into two classes: 74 objects corresponding to the first class of patients in whom the disease was not detected and 87 objects corresponding to the class of patients in whom Alzheimer's disease was identified. After the removal of genes whose identifiers did not match the gene ontology identifiers, the total number of genes was reduced to 44,662. Thus, the initial state of the gene expression data of patients studied for Alzheimer's disease was as follows: (161 × 44, 662).</p><p>The second type of data consists of gene expression data obtained through RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) method. These data are publicly available on the website of the TCGA project (The Cancer Genome Atlas) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . During the simulation process, samples corresponding to 13 types of cancer diseases were investigated. A separate group was composed of samples for which no cancer disease was detected. The data classification is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> Initially, the data contained 60,660 genes. After removing genes not expressed for any of the samples, genes with zero variance in expression profiles (the expression values for all samples are identical), and genes whose identifiers do not match the identifiers of the studied organism's genes according to gene ontology, 25,566 genes remained. At this stage, the gene expression data were defined by the number of genes of the relevant type that determine the state of the organism being studied. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> illustrates the distribution of maximum gene counts in the respective profiles for all studied samples (6,344). Min 1st Qu (25%) Median Mean 3rd Qu (75%) Max 1 861 9525 49389 30920 12581910</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2. The character of the distribution of gene counts absolute maximum values in respective profiles for all studied samples</head><p>As the analysis of the distribution of maximum gene count values in respective profiles shows, the absolute values are inconvenient for further data processing. The data normalization was carried out in several stages. In the first step, the absolute gene expression values were transformed into a more convenient range, CPM -Count Per Million, according to the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">CPM i j = count i j ∑ m j=1 count i j • 10 6<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where: i is the identifier of the sample being studied; j is the number of gene identifiers corresponding to the i-th sample; count i j is the count of j-type genes in the i-th sample; the multiplier 10 6 acts as a normalizing factor to some extent.</p><p>To reduce the impact of very high gene count values on further analysis, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the CPM values in the subsequent step. The results of the distribution of the normalized data are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> At the next step, genes that were low-expressed across all samples (maximum expression value of the respective profile &lt; 0) were removed. At the final step, negative gene expression values were replaced with zeros, corresponding to genes not expressed in individual samples. The number of genes at this stage was reduced to 23,655. Thus, initially, the gene expression data of patients studied for various types of cancer appeared as: (6344 × 23955). Initially, the data contained 44,662 genes. After analyzing gene identifiers for correspondence with the identifiers of all genes in the "org.Hs.eg.db" database, the number of relevant genes was reduced to 21,367. The adjusted p-value threshold was set at 0.01. In this case, with a 99% probability, 4,841 ontologies were identified as significant. The table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the 10 most significant ontologies considering the adjusted p-values, terms corresponding to each ontology, and the number of genes. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the distribution character of the identified ontologies at different p-values obtained by applying the Fisher's test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is depicted. Ontologies corresponding to a gene count greater than 10 are marked in red, while those with a gene count less than 10 are marked in blue. As can be seen from the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the significance of ontologies when applying different tests can contradict each other. Thus, ontologies significant according to Fisher's test may be insignificant according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and vice versa. Therefore, in forming the list of significant gene identifiers, the results of both tests were used. An ontology was considered significant if it was significant according to both the Fisher's test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. At this stage, 14,601 significant genes were identified, and the gene expression data of patients studied for Alzheimer's disease reached a dimension of (161 × 14, 601).</p></div>

The results of applying gene ontology analysis for  The analysis of the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> confirms the assumption regarding the higher quality of data obtained using the RNA sequencing method. Specifically, the number of annotated and significant genes in the identified ontologies is substantially larger compared to previous data, with the p-values, both in the Fisher's test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, being significantly lower. This indicates a high probability that the identified ontologies are significant. When applying the ANOVA test with correction of the obtained p-values, 21,582 significant ontologies were identified. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> depicts a bubble chart of the distribution of identified ontologies at different p-values obtained using Fisher's and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. In this case, the threshold defining the color of the corresponding ontologies was doubled compared to previous studies and was set at 20 genes. Analysis of the obtained chart allows the conclusion that there is a small number of ontologies corresponding to a large number of genes, with several ontologies having maximum significance both in the Fisher's test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. There is also a certain number of significant ontologies in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, whose significance in the Fisher's test is lesser. It is also important to highlight an ontology that is insignificant in both tests and also contains a large number of genes. As a result of applying gene ontology analysis, 17,069 significant genes were identified for further research, resulting in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implementation of the Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA) for forming clusters of co-expressed gene expression profiles</head><p>The SOTA clustering algorithm is currently one of the modern self-organizing algorithms focused on processing highdimensional data. It is a clustering method that utilizes the principles of self-organization of neural networks, based on the ideas of Kohonen maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and the method of growing cell structures proposed by Fritzke <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Unlike Kohonen maps, which transform high-dimensional input data into a two-dimensional array of small dimensions, SOTA forms a binary topological tree that reflects the data structure according to the principles of Fritzke's cell growth. This process entails that the number of network nodes increases in regions with high object density, while in less dense zones, the number of nodes remains unchanged, allowing for the consideration of uneven distribution of objects. The character of the object grouping using the SOTA is determined by parameters for the correction of cell weights wcell, pcell, and scell, as well as by the threshold value of the relative change in the coefficient of variation E, which defines the stopping point of the algorithm. Within the scope of current research, the task of determining the optimal hyperparameters of the algorithm is solved using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Taking into account the recommendations of the algorithm's authors and the results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , the following relationship between the weights of the corresponding cell vectors was adopted:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">pcell = scell • 5; wcell = pcell • 2<label>(10)</label></formula><p>When applying the correlation metric as a proximity function, the threshold value of the coefficient of variation was set to zero. In this case, the algorithm stopped upon the repetition of two consecutive configurations. Preliminary results of the modeling confirmed the appropriateness of this approach. Thus, within the current research, only the value of the hyperparameter scell was optimized. Figures <ref type="figure">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrate the results of applying the Bayesian optimization algorithm to determine the optimal value of the hyperparameter scell using gene expression data of patients studied for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and various types of cancer, respectively. The value of the parameter scell was varied during the modeling within the range from 0.0001 to 0.01. As a simulation result, the following values of the hyperparameter scell were determined:</p><p>• for the gene expression data of patients studied for Alzheimer's disease: 0.0295;</p><p>• for the gene expression data of patients studied for various types of cancer: 0.00229. The result of applying the SOTA clustering algorithm with optimal hyperparameter values to the studied gene expression data is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10/20</head><p>The analysis of the obtained results allows concluding that the application of the SOTA algorithm in all cases led to the gene expression profiles being divided into two clusters.

At this stage of the simulation, a convolutional neural network was employed, with the optimal hyperparameter values for each data type determined based on Bayesian optimization using 10-fold cross-validation. According to the research findings presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , two-layer CNN with a sigmoid function for convolutional layers, a selu function for the dense layer, and a so f tmax function for the output layer were utilized. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the classification of samples in all instances was carried out using the full set of significant genes (after applying the first step of filtering by gene ontology analysis) and subsets of gene expression data obtained at the previous stage of the current simulation procedure's implementation. In The absence of model overfitting was controlled by monitoring the convergence of classification accuracy values and loss function calculated on the data for training and validating the model during its training process.

The analysis Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref> provides an evaluative analysis of the classification outcomes for various gene expression data types utilized at this modelling phase. This analysis suggests that the application of gene expression data subsets, developed using the proposed methodology, tends to enhance classification outcomes in nearly all instances. Notably, when these subsets are employed, the classification performance is commendably high. Specifically, from a total of 49 samples, inaccuracies were noted in 5 samples in the first data subset and 4 samples in the second one, resulting in classification accuracies of 89.8% and 91.8%, respectively.</p><p>Tables 10 -12 and Figures 12 -14 display the classification results of samples based on gene expression data from patients studied for various types of cancer. Similar to the data investigated for Alzheimer's disease, the modelling results were evaluated using both the full dataset and subsets formed by applying the proposed methodology. The analysis of the results indicates high classification performance in all cases. This can be attributed to the higher quality of data produced by the RNA sequencing method. However, it should be noted that parallelizing the data processing stream through cluster-bicluster analysis and gene ontology analysis contributes to more objective decision-making regarding the condition of the subject under study. This fact also highlights the advantages of using the proposed methodology for processing gene expression data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The application of gene ontology analysis to gene expression data has demonstrated its potential in refining data for more precise disease classification. The method's ability to significantly reduce gene numbers, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, highlights the efficiency of gene ontology in pinpointing the most pertinent biological processes associated with Alzheimer's and other diseases. This streamlined dataset not only enhances interpretability but also focuses on genes involved in key biological functions, essential for disease diagnosis.</p><p>The SOTA clustering algorithm's implementation for cluster formation introduces a method to bifurcate the data processing flow. This approach enhances the objectivity in decision-making regarding the state of the subject under investigation in the methodology's final stage. By utilizing a binary topological tree, SOTA achieves a nuanced segregation of gene expression profiles, aiding in the identification of co-expressed gene groups. This nuanced segregation is vital for exploring the heterogeneity of diseases such as Alzheimer's and various cancers, facilitating the delineation of disease subtypes and the potential discovery of new therapeutic targets.</p><p>Furthermore, the integration of biclustering and gene ontology analysis in creating subsets of significant and co-expressed gene expression data not only refines the dataset for analysis but also ensures the preservation of the data's biological relevance. The correct implementation of clustering and biclustering algorithms hinges on precisely setting the values of algorithm hyperparameters, accomplished through Bayesian optimization with suitable target objective functions tailored to the data type. The application of convolutional neural networks for the final identification of sample states underscores the capability of deep learning in unravelling complex patterns within high-dimensional data. Optimizing CNN hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization fine-tunes the model to the dataset's specifics, achieving high classification accuracies. Nonetheless, the reduced effectiveness observed when utilizing the full gene expression data set, as opposed to the refined subsets generated by the proposed methodology (illustrated in Figures 9 to 11), accentuates the significance of data preprocessing and feature selection in enhancing model performance.</p><p>The combined results affirm the efficacy of the proposed methodology in improving the classification accuracy of complex diseases based on gene expression data. This study, by skillfully merging gene ontology analysis, cluster-bicluster analysis, and deep learning, offers a comprehensive approach to processing gene expression data to enhance the diagnostic systems for complex diseases. This methodology not only bolsters diagnostic accuracy but also paves the way for personalized medicine, enabling the customization of treatments based on the identified specific genetic profiles.</p><p>In conclusion, this study confirms the utility of the proposed methodology in processing gene expression data for disease classification. The high classification accuracies, especially when analyzing data subsets crafted through the methodology, highlight its potential for clinical applications. Future endeavours will aim to extend this methodology's application to additional complex diseases, refine the model's predictive capabilities, and investigate its utility in pinpointing potential therapeutic targets.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
