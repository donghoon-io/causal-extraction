<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As an Electrical Engineering (EE) major, the opportunities to learn about computer organization and architecture are limited, unless their emphasis area is Computer Engineering (CpE). The Introduction to CpE course, which is required for EE and CpE majors, introduces the basics of computer hardware, and precedes courses that focus on computer organization and architecture development and design. These subsequent courses are electives for EE majors, and could be the only exposure they have to this material. One of these courses, Digital Systems Design, focuses on the 8051 family of microcontrollers to teach embedded system design of microcontroller based applications. The 8051 platform is different from the Gnome 1-2 and Gumnut 3 microprocessor platforms, the earlier has been previously taught at Missouri S&amp;T. As the 8051's internal organization can be difficult to grasp, at an introductory level, the internal conceptual workings of this family of microcontrollers are explained over a semester using the instruction set. This normally involves implementing projects using programming to create applications, but leaves students with limited knowledge of the internal architecture of a microcontroller. Other courses teach microprocessor design using Hardware Descriptive Languages (HDL), such as VHDL and Verilog <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> .</p><p>In order to provide exposure to a simple internal architecture, the Weekend Instructional Microprocessor (WIMP51), a simpler version of the 8051 with a smaller instruction set, was formerly designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . The original WIMP51 was created using VHDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , a hardware descriptive language, which is not normally introduced to students in the Introduction to CpE course. Instead students are required to create digital circuits using Block Diagram Files (BDF), as a graphic Page 26.1742.2 representation of a digital circuit, in Altera's Quartus II design software. After simulation, these circuits can be downloaded and tested on Altera's DE II FPGA board. With this knowledge, it seems fitting that a subsequent course in CpE, which concentrates on microcontroller based embedded system design, would use the BDF platform in order to teach basics of microprocessor design, which allows students to easily learn the concepts in a familiar environment.</p><p>A group of junior and senior level EE students were given the task of using the basic organizational diagram and instruction set as the reference, and the knowledge learnt in the Introduction to CpE course, to recreate the WIMP51 processor, using the BDF platform, via an experiential learning project. Note that the group did not have any prior knowledge on microprocessor design techniques. They also had not yet taken the Digital Systems Design course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design Methodology</head><p>The WIMP51 design was based on the available block diagram and instruction set <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , shown below in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>. Some additional state machine information, including the three main states, in an instruction cycle, was also available <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . In order to complete the design, in the allotted time, minor changes in the internal organization (missing 'PSEN' as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and the instruction set (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) had to be made. Each Upper-level block was broken down, into sub-systems, to determine the required internal structure to correctly process information using the machine code mentioned in the instruction set (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The instructions were grouped according to their similarities in machine code. Using this resemblance information, the required control logic was designed for each of the major blocks seen in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>  Throughout the construction process, the placement of different top-level entity blocks, in the BDF, was kept similar to their location as seen in the block diagram (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This process aided circuit troubleshooting as required. The WIMP51 was created using a bottom up approach.</p><p>Page 26.1742.4</p><p>First, common basic datapath components were designed with basic digital logic gates. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows an example of basic element of self-loop (a 2:1 MUX), which allows either a new input to enter or the output of the memory element to be routed back into the memory element. Several other basic elements were created, which included multiplexers, decoders, priority encoders, and 8-bit binary adder unit. These elements were turned into their own individual block symbols and used to create larger blocks of the microprocessor. Some of these larger elements include the Zero Flag (ZF), Register File (RF), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and Program Counter (PC)-ALU.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows how the self-loop block was used to create the ZF, an element that detects if the content of the Accumulator (ACC) is zero. Self-loop is not only used in the ZF block. It is also used in each register, including the Instruction Register (IR), Auxiliary Register (AUX), the ACC, the PC, and the registers that make up the RF. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows the ZF in its place in the top-level WIMP51 structure connected to the ACC. These elements were created so students could replicate them easily, gain an understanding of their functions, and reuse them in their own designs if needed.  In order to maximize access and simplify the design process, the required control signals were generated externally to each upper-level entity. This ensured that similar components, such as the registers used for the AUX and the eight registers in the RF, were consistent in design.</p><p>Page 26.1742.5</p><p>Students could easily access control signal blocks without having to look at the controlled block. This facility also allowed for easy troubleshooting of the system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design Features</head><p>Through the design and construction process, several facilities were provided that would maximize student understanding of the internal working of the processor. Since there are a number of registers in the WIMP51 architecture, it would be prudent to observe their contents during an instruction cycle. One limitation discovered, during implementation, was the limited number (only eight) of Seven-Segment-Displays (SSD) available on the Altera board. With two displays required to show eight bits of data in HEX form, only four register values could be viewed at a time unless multiple data-sources are multiplexed. After careful consideration, a standard output viewing package was setup, which included access to important registers, control and status signals. The project implementation also included the construction of two programs; the first for entering the machine code into the on-board RAM module, and the second for running the stored program using the WIMP51.</p><p>The program for entering the machine code allows the user to enter an 8-bit binary instruction or address on the Altera FPGA RAM using switches, and view the HEX equivalent using two SSD each. Once both the instruction and address have been entered correctly, a push button is used to save the instruction to a RAM location before entering another. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the components, on the Altera FPGA board, which were used for user input and system output, Page 26.1742.6</p><p>while Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides a description of the components used. A demonstration video can be found on the project webpage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>: Locations of features used to enter an 8-bit instruction and memory address to the Altera FPGA on-board RAM. This organization allows the user to associate the 8-bit binary instruction with its HEX equivalent. The program used for running the stored machine code was more complex than the one used for entering it. Access to standard register and control signals values was provided as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> and described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. Following is a description of the features included in WIMP51 program and displayed on the Altera FPGA board:</p><p>• Access to six register values was setup as part of the standard viewing package. Since only four sets of seven segment displays are available on the board, some of the register data had to be multiplexed, which are controlled by switches (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). To achieve deeper understanding and learning, it was considered prudent to provide some facility which could be used to access additional internal register and/or control signal values. Unassigned output pins and seven segment decoders were setup for such additional registers and control signals as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. Even though reassigning pins will decrease accessibility to standard registers, a user or a designer can observe and verify the internal working of a module for planned system improvement or expansion. learning, access to the activation and deactivation of different control signals during each state of an instruction cycle was provided, as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. The standard viewing package included access to different write enables, flags, and internal ALU decode signals. Note that some of the LEDs, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, are not assigned to any signal. Capacity exists so that a user can view additional control signals as desired. As users become more familiar with the WIMP51, they will no longer need as much time during certain instructions. An option to use a push button (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>), to speed up the clock, was provided as part of the standard user control package. • After viewing the program, the user may wish to go back and review the program again.</p><p>In order to run the program again, a reset facility was incorporated as mentioned in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. Page 26.1742.9</p><p>It is anticipated that the provided standard viewing package, along with a running test program and access to the internal circuit diagram will allow the user to understand the working of the WIMP51. Additional details can be found on the project webpage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>: Access to additional register data and control signals, which is provided in terms of unassigned output pins and seven-segment decoders, in addition to the standard provided access.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Platform for Class Project Implementation</head><p>The WIMP51 was primarily recreated to serve as a teaching tool and project platform in the regularly taught Digital Systems Design course, which is typically divided into three phases. The WIMP51 instruction and the corresponding major class project form the first phase of the course. Students are taught the WIMP51 and its internal design. They learn how to use its instruction set to write program, and, synchronously, are given access to the WIMP51 and its associated programming circuit. They hardware test the WIMP51, using test programs. Concurrently, the first major design project is assigned, in which they are required to improve the WIMP51 by adding, 8051 instructions, to current instruction set <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . This project was implemented in the spring semester of 2014 at the Missouri S&amp;T and Missouri State University (MSU) Cooperative Engineering program. All enrolled students were EE majors. The Page 26.1742.10 successful completion of the project required the fruitful demonstration of their version of the WIMP51 using test programs that included their additions to the current instruction set.</p><p>Though students found the project relatively difficult to implement, as compared to the other course projects, the project experience allowed them to gain knowledge into basic processor design, construction and testing. Additional information, on the implemented course projects, along with demonstration videos, can be found on the course webpage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>The reimplementation of the WIMP51 learning and project development platform proved to be a successful learning experience for undergraduate EE students who did not have any prior knowledge on processor design techniques. Even though WIMP51 is rudimentary in design, the implementation allowed undergraduate EE students working on the project to gain experience in computer organization and architecture design principles via an experiential learning project. Such exercises are an essential confidence and skill building platforms, which expose students to project-based learning is areas, which are closely related to their field of study, and should be encouraged at all levels of undergraduate study. In addition, the developed learning tool proved to be a successful stage to implement a major class project, which can easily be implemented in a familiar design environment for a the academic level of the course. Future work will concentrate on the design optimization of the recreated WIMP51. An important goal was to get the logic to work. Since the clock is significantly slowed down, effort was not made to enhance the design. Also, owing to time restrictions, a simulation testbench was not created. Adding simulation profiles may augment current teaching methodology of the WIMP51. Furthermore, this project can branch out into additional similar projects, which involve creating different versions of the WIMP51 that incorporate hardware peripherals typically found in the 8051 family of microcontrollers. It is anticipated that such projects would be lengthy and time consuming, and, therefore, will become part of experiential learning projects implemented outside the traditional lecture course environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Block diagram of the WIMP51.
