<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Today, many Filipinos are engaged in handicraft businesses. Handicraft-making has become a means of livelihood for them, especially now that many handicraft owners are exporting their products to Japan, United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other countries around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Revised Manuscript Received on March 17, 2020.</p><p>Handicraft industry is important because it enhances creativity and provides employment to those who are in need. Handicrafts are a form of industry and products that are, for the greater part made by hand. They are usually produced with low initial capital investment from materials available mostly within the producing country.</p><p>According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization/ Information Technology Community (UNESCO /ITC) International Symposium on "Crafts and the International Market: Trade and Customs Codification", Manila, Philippines, October 1997: Handicrafts can be defined as products which are produced either completely by hand or with the help of tools. Mechanical tools may be used as long as the direct manual contribution of the artisan remains the most substantial component of the finished product. Handicrafts are made from raw materials and can be produced in unlimited numbers. Such products can be utilitarian, aesthetic, artistic, creative, culturally attached, decorative, functional, traditional, religiously and socially symbolic and significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Thus handicraft requires a lot of skill and hard work that goes into every piece of handicraft. Each handicraft is a masterpiece in its own right. Throughout the Philippines, the commercial middle class is gradually expanding on the level of provincial capital, municipal town, and village. The entrepreneurs who form this class take part in the continuing commercialization of the rural and urban economies, and profit from it. A little-known category in this rising entrepreneurial class consists of traders and manufacturing entrepreneurs in the country's expanding crafts.' Important manufacturing industries based on household or workshop production, and geared to the domestic or export market, are concentrated in several Philippine provinces.</p><p>The rapid rise of export crafts was due to an increase in Western demand for tropical gift ware, the spread of international subcontracting, and the export oriented industrialization policy initiated by the Marcos administration in the 1970s. An important precondition for this expansion was that small production units in villages and towns were still viable for the manufacture of a range of consumer goods. It is this feature that accounted for the ramified networks of provincial traders and subcontracting entrepreneurs that link small producers to wider markets. Production usually takes place in rural areas or small towns because of a local supply of raw materials and/or of cheap, underemployed labor. Production units remain small because there is little financial incentive, or opportunity, for entrepreneurs to mechanize. With this arising competition within the handicraft industry, production strategies and product quality should be within the parameter of its demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, the case company is a small scale wood handicraft company named VENRON Home craft. It is one of the leading suppliers of wood carved products such as plates, bowls, cutting boards, salad servers etc. In U.S., Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Hawaii through their contractors which are Durus, Starwood, Sunwood and Jarah Homeraft. It was founded by Mr. Jaime T. Quiros in 1982. He was the father of the current owner and operation manager Mr. Ronald T. Quiros. The company started on specializing wood carving for their product last July 31, 2014.Products are made base to the purchase order of the contractor company and raw materials were ordered in a just in time basis. Customers of the contractor mostly order products like chopping boards, round plates, square plates, salad servers and bowls all made out of acacia woods. The company has 34 workers inside its production that is located at Purok 1, Brgy. Calantas, Floridablanca Pampanga. The workers were divided on each process were 5 workers are for cutting, 3 for carving, 2 for drying, 5 for sanding,5 for quality control and 12 are for finishing and packing and 2 additional workers are for Material Handling. Workers have a minimum of 8 labor hours and could take an overtime work that is up to 12 hours. Machines are used in some processes of the company, such as Bandsaw Machine, Torno and Lathe Machine, Planing Machine and Sanding Machine.</p><p>Production is a scientific process which involves transformation of raw material (input) into desired product or service (output) by adding economic value <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Facility planning is concerned with the design, layout, and accommodation of people, machines and activities of a system or enterprise within a physical spatial environment. Facility planning is very important in a manufacturing process due to their effect in achieving an efficient product flow. It is estimated that between 20%-50% of the total costs in manufacturing is related to material handling. Plant layout planning aims to have a more effective work flow at the facility, allowing workers and equipment being more productive <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> One of the main purposes of this is to find the most effective facility arrangement and minimize material handling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. An emerging consensus that existing layout configurations do not meet the needs of manufacturing companies to which there is a need for a new generation of standardized work that is more flexible and modular. This action could be conducted under existing resources such as employees, machines and other facilities. Work Standardization has become a fundamental basis of today's industrial plants which can influence parts of work efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> A fishbone diagram below shows a representation of the collected data based from the observations, surveys and interviews being conducted in the company that will discuss the problem that was being identified in the company.  In determining the factors that could affect the productivity a checklist survey was being conducted to the workers of the company. As shown above, the results that are above 50 percent has a high effect in the company's productivity.</p><p>An initial assessment of the workplace area, process and production flow was being conducted to identify the factors that are affecting any of the company's system. The problem that is being encountered is delay in the production process due to several factors that is involved in it. These factors are being showed in the body of the fishbone diagram. After the diagram is being assessed areas of improvement are being chosen. Environment, man and method were the chosen field to conduct a primary study to solve the problem. During the observation the environment of the production system lacks of cleanliness and orderliness during the work in process flow.</p><p>It has a poor facility layout design that blocks the continuous flow of the production. And workers were prone to accidents based on observed hazards.</p><p>The general objective of this study is to assess the existing facility layout of the company to improve productivity in the production process by achieving the following specific objective:</p><p>• To introduce Systematic Layout Plan for the company • To improve company's productivity and process flow through travel time and distance reduction</p><p>• To recommend a Basic Workplace Safety Manual to increase safety measures and knowledge of the workers in the company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY A. Data Collection and Instrument</head><p>An Input-Process-Output (IPO) model was made to define the requirement in conducting the study, processing of the requirements, and the final output.</p></div>

To acquire data Observation, Interview and Analysis of the work area was being conducted. Implementation will be followed after the data gathering. Process implementation will be then followed by the result of the study.</p><p>The study is for the improvement of VENRON Home craft in their production process through current layout assessment and improved workplace area for improved production process management. The study is mainly for the company that workers, production and management will benefit to its result and implementation. The company aims to increase the productivity of the company by with an application of a new systematic layout plan. The purpose of the study for the student is to be able to apply and practice the industrial engineering tools and concepts being acquired in the school.</p><p>Scope of the study will be centered and limited in the production area of the company for the proposed systematic layout plan. Basic workplace safety manual will also be prepared for the company's awareness for safety. The study aims to increase productivity within the company's production area.</p><p>Observation and interviews were the initial methods being used to gather data. Observation to company layout design and process flow chart is being done to have an initial data to assess the company's situation to determine where to conduct a study. Interview to the company owner and operation manager was conducted to have an insight to some of the problem the company is encountering.</p><p>A descriptive research design was used to acquire this relevant and important information. A Systematic Layout Planning was used to assess current facility layout of the company and introduce new alternative layouts that will optimize the company's production layout</p><p>The subject of this study is the management and workers of the company that will benefit to the study. They will be the basis in implementing the study that will test and evaluate the further result The primary data were being gathered through interviews with the owner and workers within the company. The secondary data were from Journals, Articles and Books that are related and will be related to the study</p><p>The following are the procedures needed to gather important information to support the proposed stud:</p><p>Observation is the initial data collection process that will acquire basic primary data being gathered.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Process Flow Chart of the Company's production</head><p>The case company has 3 departments; the processing department, finishing department and packaging department. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the company's current exiting layout. Based on the observation the production area is the most needed area that is to be assessed. The production department is located at the back of the company layout and it includes most of the production process of the product and the wood raw materials.</p><p>The General Process Flow Chart of the Company's production was shown on Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> to give a clear flow on how the product flows in the whole operation. The Material Flow of the product and the frequency of the flow was being shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Spaghetti diagram approach</head><p>Spaghetti diagram shows the movement of materials using a continuous flow line tracing the path of an item through processes shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The thickness of lines shows the frequency of travel flow in the process. The legend shows the observation in the following colors per process to process  A From-To Chart was used to identify the distance and time in each department as shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 5</ref> respectively. Conducting a From-To Chart the total distance and time travelled of the current existing layout was being determined. Following the production flow of RM-CT-T-CT-P-CV-MD-S-QC-MC1-MLS-MC2-LS-PC-DH-PG the total travel distance is 142.15m and the total travel time is 6.92min</p><p>Space Requirement is being computed to determine the space to be considered and the availability of it by understanding the flow between machines and the interaction between the facilities we can determine the space necessary for the work area.</p><p>To calculate the extra space in the work area the workstation, auxiliary equipment, operator space, incoming material and work-in-process space and it will be added to other separate quantities to determine the total space needed for each workstation.</p><p>Typically, 150% of space allowance is needed for the extra space (Sunderesh Heragu, 1997)</p><p>The summary of Total Space required for each production area was being shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>. The calculated total area requirement for the production department is 390.97 sqm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Space Comparison of Current and Required</head><p>A comparison to the current and requireed area for each process was being shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref>. This proves that some of the work area were overspaced or underspaced. Standard Time to each process was being compute as shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref>. The particular small round wooden plate product would take 112.04 mins per piece to be fully produced. A computed production capacity for each process was shown at Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref>. Capacity was used to determine the limit of the production for the specific area. The Production which is the lowest capacity will be declared as the overall production capacity.</p><p>To define the adjacency and closeness of the process and machines a relationship diagram was being made as seen below on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>. The specific letter codes and numbers were being used to assign the relationship. To represent and conduct a block diagram, areas were being rounded off and divided into 2 to produce a lower number in building the blocks. See appendix _ to show the computation. The summary of the required block was being shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">12</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Proposed Layout 1 for the Company</head><p>Following the required areas for each process, the researcher proposed four alternative layouts for the company. Layouts were being based on the activity relationship diagram and the space requirements needed for each process to develop a systematic layout plan. The proposed layouts were being shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>, 10 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>.  A spaghetti diagram was shown on Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> to show the material and process flow of the product in the first new proposed layout. Conducting a From-To Chart as to the Proposed Layout 1 shown at Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">13</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">14 gives</ref>     A spaghetti diagram was shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> to show the material and process flow of the product in the first new proposed layout. Conducting a From-To Chart to the Proposed Layout 3 as shown at Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">17</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 18</ref> For calculating the Percentage Reduction per Layout the following total distance and total time values shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">22</ref> was being used for the computation. Showing the results, Proposed Layout 4 which has a result of 12.61% reduction of distance and 22.05% reduction on time has the most reduced percentage of travel and distance time compared to the other layout alternatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Cost Benefit Analysis</head><p>Cost Benefit Analysis was being to compare and show the transparency of difference of the production between the alternative layouts. For computing the production cost the company could save the additional output per day was being computed. Additional outputs per day were being multiplied to the price of the product per unit. Cost Saved per day will be computed then. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>Assessment of the current facility layout will improve the production process of the company that will reduce the travel time and distance. Four alternative layouts were being proposed for the company. Difference of each layout to their total travel distance and time was being computed to compare the layouts. Percentage reduction from current layout to the following proposed layout was also being computed. Resulting to, among the following proposed layouts the most reduced percentage of time and distance travelled is from the proposed layout 4. With a result of 12.16% distance reduction and 22.05%-time reduction. Cost Benefit Analysis was also being used for the comparison.</p><p>The fourth proposed layout still has the most saved cost per day of 336.25 pesos with additional output of 2.49 units. With these results it shows that it will be effective for the company to redesign and re layout the company. Doing this could help on the company's productivity and could bring an additional income for the company. Other proposed layouts could also be used but among the four alternatives. The fourth layout is he most beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>The researcher advises to implement the Fourth Proposed Layout of the Company for their renovation. For this provides the highest decrease in time and distance traveled of their workers and also has the highest additional cost. The researcher would also like to introduce a Basic Safety Manual for the workers and the machines within the company premises. Based on observation, hazards are everywhere and could have a great impact in the company if not being solved as early as possible. An assessment to the company's facility was being conducted determining if it complies with the OSHA standards on illumination, ventilation and workplace temperature.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Fishbone Diagram</figDesc><graphic coords="2,318.68,50.40,218.82,169.02" type="bitmap" /></figure>
