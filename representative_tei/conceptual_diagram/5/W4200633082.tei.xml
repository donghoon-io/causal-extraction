<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction. The theme of dynamical phase transitions enabled by the interplay of interactions, drive, and dissipation permeates different branches of quantum many body physics, such as quantum optics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, cold atoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and non-equilibrium solid state physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The interest in them ranges from practical applications in dynamical control to the fundamentals of statistical mechanics. The exploration and understanding of non-equilibrium phases would benefit from a unifying language, which, however, remains elusive due to the diversity of microscopic ingredients, relevant scales, and engineering capabilities across the various platforms.</p><p>In this Letter, we take a first step in filling this gap by studying a barebones model that offers complementary interpretations pertinent both to spintronics and drivendissipative quantum optics, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. We analyse a spin ensemble where coherent dynamical responses ascribable to lasing can be induced by weak coupling to a subsystem incoherently pumped into a population inverted regime. The model can be realized in an optical cavity, where two species of atoms, S and T , are coupled to each other as well as to a common lossy cavity mode [cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>]. The ensemble S collectively couples to the cavity photon via a Dicke term, while the ensemble T does via a spin-boson interconversion term. Dynamical instabilities can be induced in the subsystem S by incoherently spin pumping the subsystem T , even in a limit of weak coupling between them. The interplay of the spin pumping and the Dicke coupling opens a parameter space where lasing and superradiant phases intertwine and lead to novel dynamical regimes exhibiting features of both.</p><p>Our motivation to separate the coherent (S) and incoherent (T ) spin subsystems stems from a solid-state viewpoint, to allow quantum correlations to settle in without much disruption from direct pumping processes. Considering magnet-metal heterostructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as a primary example, the magnet layer has a stiff order parameter accompanied by coherent excitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, while itinerant electrons carrying incoherent spins in the metal layer are more amenable to external control <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. One of the consequences of the magnet being a strongly interacting system is the propensity of a long-wavelength magnon to undergo (Bose-Einstein) condensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is mimicked by the bosonic mode in our model. In a magnet, such condensation can manifest as a static phase transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, or a dynamical one with the magnetic order parameter precessing spontaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, bearing analogy to the superradiant and lasing transitions, respectively. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(c), a magnon condensation can be triggered by electrically pumping the heterostructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. A spin accumulation is induced via the spin Hall effect in the metal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and exerts a spin torque <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> on the magnetic dynamics by interfacial magnon-electron scatterings. Such a torque can overcome the intrinsic magnon decay and maintain a quasi-equilibrium condensate of magnons. In addition, the magnon condensate and the thermally occupied short-wavelength magnons undergo coupled dynamics, previously described by a two-fluid theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Our model, though much simplified from this practical scenario, allows for a full treatment of the interplay of spin pumping, coupling between the interacting magnetic system and pumped reservoir, and dissipative effects. We argue that the emergence of a dynamical phase, intertwining lasing and superradiance as a result of a pumping scheme inspired from spintronics (phase L2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), and yet realizable in a quantum many body optics platform, can provide a conceptual bridge between the two communities. Model. We consider a Dicke sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, which consists of an ensemble S of N spins-1/2 collectively coupled to a bosonic mode a of frequency ω c , weakly interacting with an ensemble T of an additional set of N spins. The level splitting of spins in subsystem S (T ) is ω z (ω z ). The full Hamiltonian reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H = ω c a † a + ω z S z + ω z T z + λ √ N a + a † S + + S -+ η √ N aT + + a † T -+ η N S + T -+ S -T + ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a and a † are bosonic annihilation/creation operators, mimicking the magnon condensate or the cavity photon, while the collective spin operators are</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S -= N i=1 σ - i and T -= N i=1 τ - i .</formula><p>Here σ α i and τ α i with α = x, y, z are spin-1/2 operators. We have introduced the Dicke coupling λ, a small boson-spin interconversion term η, and a small spin exchange coupling η .</p><p>The ensemble T is driven incoherently into a grandcanonical state with temperature T and spin accumulation µ, by spin pump with rate γ ↑ and loss γ ↓ , which is described by the following Lindblad master equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> for the joint density matrix of the total system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dρ dt = -i [H, ρ]+κD[a]+γ ↑ N i=1 D[τ + i ]+γ ↓ N i=1 D[τ - i ],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>neglecting spin dephasing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The dissipators</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D[x] ≡ xρx † -1/2 x †</formula><p>x, ρ are defined as usual, and the spin pump and loss rates γ ↑ = γ t /(1 + e β(ω z -µ) ) and γ ↓ = γ t /(1 + e -β(ω z -µ) ) are parametrized by β = T -1 &gt; 0 and µ, with γ t = γ ↑ + γ ↓ ≥ 0. Evolution according to Eq. (2) drives the system into a mixed state with a relative population of up and down spins controlled by the ratio γ ↑ /γ t . When µ &gt; ω z , the incoherent subsystem T experiences population inversion which can be transferred to the rest of the system via η and η and trigger a lasing instability. For γ t η, η , it quickly relaxes towards a steady state with T z ≈ (γ ↑γ ↓ )/2γ t , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T ± ≈ 0.</formula><p>In the dissipative dynamics of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), we have also considered photon loss with rate κ in order to model the photon line-width of the cavity. The relaxation of the collective bosonic mode in a magnet, on the other hand, depends self-consistently on its dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. We therefore consider, as alternative, a viscous damping of the magnon condensate, whenever the spintronic relevance is concerned. In terms of magnetic dynamics, the phenomenological Gilbert damping <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> slows down the coherent precession of the order parameter and brings it towards the global equilibrium state <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. Interestingly, our results remain qualitatively unaltered under dissipation through photon loss or Gilbert damping <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Before moving to a thorough discussion of our results, we remark that the model in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> should not be regarded as a faithful modelization of an actual spintronics system. For instance, the Dicke coupling does not naturally occur in magnets. Rather, our model contains the key ingredients for interplay of coherent interactions, spin pumping and magnon damping in a spintronics platform, to reveal the mechanisms for the formation of novel dynamical phases which could then be explored in the future within realistic devices. Superradiance and lasing. In presenting results below we use normalized variables a ∝ a/ √ N , S ∝ S/N, T ∝ T /N , as customary in the treatment of systems with collective light-matter interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. We start by revisiting some established dynamical regimes of the hamiltonian in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. For η = η = 0, we recover a standard Dicke model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. With λ &lt; λ c = (ω z (ω 2 c + κ 2 /4))/4ω c the system is in the normal state (NS) with a vanishing S x component and no macroscopic occupation of the photonic mode. By increasing λ &gt; λ c the system enters a super-radiant (SR) phase where it spontaneously breaks Z 2 symmetry, exhibiting S x = 0 and photon condensation, n = a † a = 0. This picture remains valid when small η and η are switched on while the spin pumping is kept weak, namely γ ↑ &lt; γ t /2 (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>).</p><p>Another limit η = λ = 0 corresponds to the incoherently pumped Tavis-Cummings model <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The choice trivializes the dynamics of the ensemble S.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">For γ ↑ /γ t ≥ 1/2 + κγ t /(8η 2 ) + κγ t (ω c -ω z ) 2 /(2η 2 (κ + γ t ) 2</formula><p>), the T spins experience population inversion, with a and T x,y undergoing oscillations. At long times, both T z and the photon number approach the steady values set by the pumping rates γ ↑/↓ <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Dynamical phase diagram. By turning on λ together with sizeable spin pumping in a weakly coupling limit (η, η → 0 + ), we generate the diagram of dynamical responses (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) in mean-field treatment, which is exact for N → ∞ <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. In the Supplemental Materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> we present the associated equations of motion and also analyze the breakdown of mean field from finite N corrections.</p><p>For strong pumping (γ ↑ &gt; γ t /2), the spins in the ensemble S display long-lived oscillatory dynamics (see Bloch spheres in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The region L1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> resembles the regular lasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> discussed above, while L2 features 'supperradiant' oscillations. The transition from L1 to L2 occurs around values of the Dicke coupling ∼ λ c , with a non-vanishing time average of S x in L2. In this phase we observe persistent oscillatory dynamics reminiscent of lasing around one of the symmetry-broken states of the Dicke model. Such 'superradiant' oscillations would not arise by directly pumping a Dicke model through the Lindblad channels in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>); they are a result of the pumping scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> conceptually borrowed from spintronics. In this regard, the dynamical phase L2 is a conceptual 'bridge' between the quantum optics and spintronics communities which we are aiming to lay out in this work. Notice that despite the pumped subsystem experiences population inversion, the spin ensemble S remains in a state with negative S z in both phases L1 and L2.</p><p>We now discuss the role of symmetries in the oscillatory dynamics displayed in L1 and L2, and in the transitions between these two different regimes. For λ = 0 the photon number n does not oscillate. A nonzero λ breaks the U(1) symmetry and the oscillations in n can be attributed to ellipticity (i.e., different amplitudes of oscillations of S spin components along x and y directions due to the presence of Dicke-like interaction term) in the spontaneous procession in absence of S z conservation. In fact, the dynamics are instead governed by a Z 2 symmetry, reflected in the observation that the oscillatory frequency of n and S z is twice that of S x . The transition from L1 to L2 is characterized by an increase in the time-average value of S x , which can be explained by the spontaneous breaking of the Z 2 symmetry upon increasing the Dicke coupling λ [cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c)]</ref>. The transition from the SR region to the L2 region appears as a crossover in finite-time numerical data, as the damping of the oscillations of S x critically slows down upon approaching the transition point from the SR side, hence the time-averaged amplitude of the oscillations in a long but finite time windows smoothly grows, blurring the expected singular behavior at the phase boundary [cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b)</ref>] associated to the dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking of the U(1) symmetry. Finally, in the transition from NS to L2, the absolute value of the time average of S x , as well as its amplitude, build up [cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d)]</ref>.</p><p>This dynamical phase diagram with competing station-  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, with the sole exception of ω z that is now chosen in resonance with the upper polariton frequency (ω z ΩU ). Insets show a stretched time axis. The system is prepared in the SR state and evolved with system's parameters γ ↑ and λ inside the region L1. The right panel shows different stages of the photon number evolution. The initial stage of dynamics is governed by the decaying lower polariton mode, while at stage C the upper polaritonic mode undergoes the dynamical instability triggered by the resonance with the incoherent subsystem; accordingly, the photon number starts to grow until it saturates around times t 500. At long times, n oscillates at the upper polaritonic frequency (panel D). This illustrative of the spin ensemble T acting as a frequency-dependent gain medium. ary (NS, SR) and oscillatory (L1, L2, IR) phases is of particular interest to spintronics, since it emerges from the interplay of incoherent spin pumping and ellipticity. U(1) symmetry is previously taken to be an important condition in studies of spin-wave lasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, though it is often broken in magnets with anisotropies. By explicitly taking this into consideration, our study suggests richer phenomena accompanying non-equilibrium phase transitions in spintronic devices. Although our model description distillates only the essential mechanisms of an actual spintronics setup, we now briefly discuss some possible implications of our results. The magnon 'lasing' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> in a uniaxial magnet can converge to a steady condensate density featured by a circular precession <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Turning on interactions explicitly breaking the U(1) symmetry is expected to induce an ellipticity in the spontaneous precession <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, accompanied by an oscillation of the condensate density due to the absence of spin conservation. This is similar to the dynamics observed in the L1 phase with λ = 0. In the regime where both Z 2 interactions and the pumping effects are sizable, two equivalent Z 2breaking limit cycles are possible (L2 phase). During the electrical pumping, angular momentum transfers reciprocally between the magnet and metal <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: as the itinerant electrons exert a spin torque to establish the magnon lasing, the coherent magnetic precession simultaneously pumps a spin current back into the metal <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, triggering transverse spin dynamics. Therefore, suppressing the transverse spin dynamics in the metal can be detrimental to magnon lasing, as consistent with the consequence of a fast-relaxing incoherent subsystem discussed above (large γ t limit, see SM for more details).</p><p>Polaritonic lasing.</p><p>Observables in the L1 and L2 phases show signatures of upper (U) and lower (L) po-laritonic modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which are symmetric (U) and antisymmetric (L) linear superpositions of spin and photon fields, describing light-matter hybridization via the Dicke coupling λ. In order to appreciate this point, we rewrite the interaction term in (1) as H int = (ηa + η S -)T + + h.c., which is suggestive that pumping the T ensemble can excite a superposition of light and matter in the S system. Thus, upper or lower polaritons can be excited in the system, depending whether the two couplings have same or opposite sign, jointly with the resonance condition, ω z Ω U/L (for related expressions, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>). The effective decay rates of the two polariton modes depend on the frequency of the incoherent subsystem ω z and in particular, for η = η , it can be analytically estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">κ eff U = κ/2 -2η 2 (γ ↑ -γ ↓ )/ (ω z -Ω U ) 2 + γ 2 t /4</formula><p>. By tuning ω z close to Ω U , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Ω U/L = ω 2 c + ω 2 z ± (ω 2 c -ω 2 z ) 2 + 16λ 2 ω z ω c /2,</formula><p>it is possible to obtain a negative effective decay rate (κ eff U &lt; 0) for γ ↑ &gt; γ ↓ . The time evolution of S z , T z , and n in this scenario are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The negative decay rate gives rise to dynamical instabilities in the L1 and L2 regimes, which we can exploit to employ the spin ensemble T as a frequency-dependent gain medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> (see SM for more details).</p><p>We now discuss the multi-stage dynamics [as marked by A to D in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>] associated with this mechanism. We initialise the system in the SR steady state of the Dicke model with photon losses (λ = 0.6 and κ = 0.06) and let it evolve with parameters characteristic of the L1 phase (λ = 0.2, γ ↑ = 0.9). For the chosen parameters, the effective decay rate κ eff L (κ eff U ) is positive (negative), i.e., the upper polariton becomes unstable. Immediately after the quench (A), the photon field has sizeable overlap with the upper and lower polariton modes. Since in the initial SR steady state the boson is enslaved to matter, a = -2λ/(ω ciκ/2) S -, the amplitude of the lower mode is higher than the amplitude of the upper one. However, as the lower mode starts to decay and the upper one is enhanced, their amplitudes become comparable (B) and we observe beating at their two frequencies. At the stage (C) the photon number increases while the lower mode is largely suppressed. As a result, for long times (D) the oscillatory dynamics of the system is solely governed by Ω U .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Gilbert damping</head><p>For the magnon condensate mode, dissipation in the form of Gilbert damping slows down the spontaneous precession of the magnetic order parameter like a viscous drag <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. It is particularly suitable in the weak-damping scenario to describe the relaxation of the precessional motion back to the equilibrium state (in the absence of external pumping) along a spiral trajectory without losing coherence. The semiclassical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref>] of a spin s reads ds/dt = s×h eff -α G s×ds/dt, where h eff is an effective Zeeman field fixing the equilibrium spin orientation, and α G is the Gilbert damping. A small-angle spin precession can be mapped to the motion of a harmonic oscillator with creation and annhilation operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> a † and a, where s z = sa † a ≈ s with S being the spin length. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the lowest order thus becomes (1 + isα G )d a /dt = -iω c a , where ω c = |h eff |. Such a form of the viscous drag can also be derived by coupling the bosonic mode a to an Ohmic bath and eliminating the bath degrees of freedom following a standard Caldeira-Leggett derivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>For our model (1), the Gilbert damping modifies the mean field equation of motion for the expectation value of the bosonic mode into</p><p>Here ∆ is a Lamb shift and B(t) is the noise term that results from the bath <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.

The system in this case is endowed with a U(1) symmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, corresponding to conservation of total number of excitations (spins+boson); non-trivial solutions of the mean-field equations of motion A1 that break dynamically the symmetry can be expressed in the form (see for instance Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>)</p><p>According to the second of the formulas in Eq. (D4), when the incoherent ensemble is in the population inverted state, the photon mode becomes effectively pumped due to the weak interaction with T . If this pumping overcomes the photon decay κ, the photon number starts to grow and dynamical instabilities are triggered. The equation that effectively governs the dynamics of the coherent subsystem can be derived in the same way and reads</p><p>Here the effective contribution from the dissipator has the form</p><p>Therefore, for regions with γ ↑ &gt; γ ↓ , spins in the system are effectively pumped by a rate proportional to the magnetization along ẑ, provided S z is negative (as it occurs in the NS or in the SR phase).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix E: Polaritons in the dynamics of L1</head><p>Frequencies of the polaritons can be evaluated by expanding the Dicke model in a leading order Holstein-Primakoff approximation and by diagonalizing the resulting hamiltonian <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> </p><p>For the parameters of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> the upper polaritonic frequency is Ω U = 1.63 and the lower one is Ω L = 0.63. Since the photon amplitude operator a can be written as the sum of upper and lower polaritons, both modes contribute to the dynamics of n. However, their effective decay rates are different, giving rise to different short-and long-time behavior of the the dynamics of n. Inside the SR phase the difference between the amplitudes of upper and lower modes can be estimated using the Holstein-Primakoff analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> as</p><p>which is much more smaller than 1 close to the λ c . If we prepare an initial state inside SR phase and let it evolve with parameters that correspond to any oscillatory phase (L1, L2, IR), the short-time dynamics is mostly governed by the lower polariton, as its amplitude dominates. We now provide estimates for the effective damping of the photon mode in various system's parameters regimes, which is given by n ∝ exp(-κ eff t), ignoring oscillations. Depending on the level splitting of the T spins, ω z , κ eff can be varied. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows the effective damping κ eff of the photonic modes as function of ω z . The effective damping coefficients κ eff U/L of lower and upper mode are extracted from dynamics of n at short and long timescales, respectively. As one can see from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, both damping coefficients have a minimum close to the resonance upper polariton frequency. Also, for all frequencies ω z , the damping of the lower mode is faster than the upper polariton, which is the reason why we observe oscillations at long times with frequency Ω U only. The upper mode is more long-lived and can even be enhanced via pumping, when ω z is close enough to the upper polaritonic frequency Ω U , resulting in lasing. For η = η , the effective damping of the upper polariton mode can be analtyically estimated as</p><p>t /4 (solid red line in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). If the system is pumped resonantly with the upper polariton frequency ω z Ω U , the critical value of γ ↑ at which the lasing region occurs can be estimated as</p><p>following a calculation similar to the one leading to Eq. (D4). In this case, lasing is obtained at a pumping frequency smaller than the conventional threshold for lasing ω z ≤ Ω U + 4η 2 (γ ↑γ ↓ )/κγ 2 t /4. The lower polaritonic mode can be resonantly pumped when η = -η . In this case, the effective damping for both modes have a minimum at the lower polariton frequency Ω L .</p></div>
