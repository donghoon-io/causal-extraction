<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The main objective of this paper is to analyze the epistemological character of isomorphism in the generation of innovation. Its specific objectives were: (1) to raise the theoretical-conceptual basis of isomorphism in the innovation process considering Design Thinking; (2) characterize the concepts inherent in the relationship of the innovation process to organizational isomorphism; and (3) analyze the impact of isomorphism from the perspective of institutional theory.</p><p>The demand for innovation can be considered as a way of supporting market competitiveness, encouraging research that enriches cognitive efforts in organizational practices. In fact, technological dynamics hastens the change of structures, compelling the new to emerge in processes, products or services, among other things; adaptation is not enough to meet the demands of consumers regarding the products they can buy. In addition, obsolescence and the search for continuous improvement justify the pursuit of innovation.</p><p>This fact means not only that organizations must create something new or significantly improved; they must also adapt, invent and create, impacting on the market with new releases. This is the assumption behind the present paper, which follows the topics and subtopics of a theoretical review, the methodology of preparation, the results, the conclusion and the relevant bibliographical references.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL REVIEW</head><p>Underlying this research is the Institutional Theory, which, according to Souza et al <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref>, considers organizational phenomena in order to find a parameter for innovation; for these authors, these parametric phenomena are examples of isomorphism, which is a search for innovation, characterized by thehyper competitiveness generated by the conflict between innovation and imitation. Following the same authors, isomorphism allows organizationsto consolidate and become stronger, since the demand for the new begins by a search for adaptive modifications that can be improved in order to achieve the aim of innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Concept of Isomorphism:</head><p>In the view of Souza et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>), isomorphism is the organizational phenomenon by which one seeks to imitate another's structures, or to become similar to another. Isomorphism is classified into two types: competitive and institutional. The first focuses on market competition, and the second on its own organizational structure.</p><p>Institutional isomorphism can be coercive, mimetic and normative and organizational innovation may be related to mimetic isomorphism. According to FilippettiNeto (2015), coercive isomorphism originatesfrom pressure exerted by stakeholders; mimetic isomorphism is that in which organizations mirror themselves in market leaders; and normative isomorphism comes from the solution of similar problems faced by the firm from the professionalization of its managers. In the process of innovation, Rossoni and Pedro Filho (2011) state that, if applied irresponsibly, mimetic isomorphism can lead to disastrous effects and is difficult or impossible to remedy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Reflections on epistemology</head><p>Epistemology has its basis in the philosophy of science, according to Serva (2013). This author believes that epistemology can be said to center on a rigorous analysis of rationalism, resulting in deep reflection, achieving the scientific standards of a study.Reflection of this kind requires nature and the stages and limits of human knowledge in order to observe the relationship between the subject and the inert object. This creates a causal relationship between the subject that researches and the object researched (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>below).</head><p>The relationship legitimates the cognitive judgment and the various structural paradigms that are common to the diverse branches of knowledge developed along its process.   -Scenario Interpretation.</p><p>-Logic (Including the Boolean).</p><p>-Truth (upon proof).</p><p>Subject: Whoever researches According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Capuano (2015)</ref>, innovation has an epistemological character whereby an understanding of the phenomenon requires multidisciplinary approaches, being a reference in the analysis of innovation,formerly by imitation and since the Renaissance by invention. These phenomena are due to the analysis of approaches which have their origin in human thought.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a. Innovation Process</head><p>Based on the Oslo Manual in OECD ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref>), innovation has to characterize the implementation of anything new to the organization, gaining competitive advantage through five possible innovation typologies:</p><p>(1)the introduction of new products;(2) a new production method; (3) the opening of new markets;(4) the development of new sources/providers of raw materials and other inputs; and (5) the creation of new market structures in an industry. The manual notes that innovation must ultimately improve performance; for this reason, companies seek to acquire advantage over their competitors when engaged in negotiations involving pricing, cost minimization and profit amplification.</p><p>Research by <ref type="bibr">Souza et al. (2013)</ref> indicates that the implementation and management of innovation stem from the sequence of process, search, and the discovery, development, updating, and commercialization of new processes or procedures, products or business. These writers state that, although some companies do not have a complete organizational structure, they can achieve efficient productivity with the release of new products. Sufficient cooperation and awareness to keep level with the competition are important factors in the innovation process, once it becomes possible to measure the results of the change arising from the creation of new processes or products, by the development of new technologies.</p><p>For <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bonini (2011)</ref>, the development of process is directly connected to the organizations that seek to increase their efficiency and generation of innovation. At this point the epistemological character that is called Design Thinking. It is the search for innovations created by people using methods from the social context whose base is the necessity of the individual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Design Thinking</head><p>Design Thinking is addressed in Silva et al. ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) as an art able to put together science and technology in proposing new solutions. It involves management methods that are capable of generating innovation. This connection between the innovation process and the new model of idea generation is the conceptual basis of studiesof the complexity inherent in the friction between innovative ideas and technology. Human creativity optimizes the processing of these new ideas in practice, which can be achieved through Design Thinking.</p><p>To Liedtka (2015), Design Thinking is still insufficiently explored by researchers. It is a process focused on innovation and emphasizing observation, collaboration, rapid learning, prototyping and simultaneous analysis.</p><p>Bonnini (2011) states that Design Thinking is a business strategy, focusing on organizational processes and supported by creative thinking. Therefore, innovation focuses directly on the individual in collaboration with others. By interacting with them one person can resolve propositions to do with problems in the optimization or improvement of ideas.</p><p>According to De Santanna (2014), the use of Design Thinking results in new business processes and is not a linear method. Thus distinguished, Design Thinking is characterized as something unstructured at first sight, but beyond doubt exploratory, if properly used in the formulation of alternative ways of solving problems. This is how Silva et al. ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) address the practice, pointing out the three phasesimmersion, ideation and prototyping in the practice of the argumentative design of ideas. The impact of using Design Thinking results in something innovative, able to resolve intangible questions, such as the business or strategic processes in the forming of relationships between the observation of the problem andits ideation and creative analysis, or between prototyping and the implementation of the required innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c. Concept of Institutional Theory</head><p>Pereira's study (2012) indicates that the emergence of Institutional Theory results from the way in which organizations incorporate prevailing practices and standards in their environment.</p><p>According to him, is clear that organizations are now shaped by management models, standardized behaviours, and adherence to new trends, causing them to learn about implied standards and the internal diversity of organizations. In significant political contexts, the contributory factors in this sense result not from specific human actions, but from culture itself.</p><p>Therefore, institutionalization is the transformation of beliefs and actions into rules for social conduct, which after becoming established by acceptance, bring about behavioral standardization. This reaches the social relations between the members of an institution, in a controlled manner, keeping the environment stable. Thus, the authors cite states where the resulting factor of institutionalism arises from the meeting of mimetic pressures, evidenced by the desire for organizational assimilation, which is considered successful, or legitimized, by members of the structure when they acknowledge the results.  <ref type="bibr">Creswell (2014)</ref> states that content analysis aims to produce inferences on the arguments which it addresses resulting from theadmission of propositions, due to its connection with other propositions already accepted, making the preparation of data consistentwith their analysis. Thus, articles and other publications relating to the topic were explored, as well as other material published in the last five years from approximately 40 articles listed in the Scielo, Capes and Google Scholar database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>The selected titles are linked to Design Thinking, innovation and isomorphism. Through content analysis the texts more relevant to what was proposed were evaluated, being structured in theoretical and conceptual references; the study results and conclusion and finally the evaluation of references then followed. The results are based on the interpretation of the specialist literature and on the author's own previous experience of selecting articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANALYSIS OF THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF ISOMORPHISM ON THE GENERATION OF INNOVATION Design</head><p>Thinking can be considered a significant method in the creation process, thus being an issue related to innovation. It is up to academia to generate knowledge on theoretical concepts that is validated by scientific standards. In this task isomorphism was considered as aninfluential way to generate innovation. Although isomorphism is identified in the market as a form of imitation, it has been applied by managers of organizations as a competitive resource; hence, it motivates the search for solutions in the competition to sell goods and services in a market. This study was developed by analyzing the positive and negative points that isomorphism presents in the innovation process, theorizing that the authors mentionedabove relate as creative factorsin market competitiveness.</p><p>A. Survey of theoretical-conceptual basis of isomorphism in innovation processes informed by Design Thinking The concept of innovation means changing something existing or new and instead creating or making possible something unprecedented. A search for competitive advantage in organizations, or search for a new of existence or maintenance in the competitive market may be assumed. Managers tend to appeal to isomorphism as a reaction that will ensure the competitiveness of their organization. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> below brings together the theoretical and conceptual basis and the descriptionsby the authors contributing to this study It is understood as the attitude of an organization that makes use of a similarity; a way of remaining competitive through imitating something successful, such as a procedure, a product or the service of another organization.</p><p>Source: prepared by the author on the basis of Internet research.</p><p>The Design Thinking process refers to the way of thinking of the designer; it is rarely studied in administration. It can be considered as the formulation of questions that lead to the apprehension or comprehension of phenomena in response to observational information,in order to generate consistent modelling with the desired innovation.</p><p>The strategic decision to use Design Thinking confirms the intention to make changes that lead organizations to highlight.The analysis from the perspective of utility indicates the possibility of developing and integrating new technologies However, the so-called Design Thinking search solutions are aimed at human behaviour, via the development of cognitive, emotional and sensorial models; it is a process of implementing new ideas, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> and its description in Table <ref type="table">3 below</ref>  </p></div>

Characterization of the concepts inherent</head><p>in the relationship between the innovation process and organizational isomorphism This section will address the particularities of the innovation process leading to isomorphism in an organization. According to the authors studied, isomorphism has three types,differentiated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mimetic</head><p>It is presented as a model in which organizations start to imitate each other, free of charge, usually resulting from an uncertainty in which they do not solve their own problems individually, but seek ideas forsuccess by copying similar processesfrom other organizations. Their model is the successful organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normativ e</head><p>It is presented as a model by which an organization is strengthened by a knowledge base relatively focused on the professionalization of its managers. Similar prevailing forms of decision-making, due to the degree of professionalization, solve similar problems Source: prepared by the author on the basis ofInternet research.</p><p>It can be concluded from the table above that the concern for innovation is clearlydue to the organization's need to create something new to fill the space or update the status of something obsolete. <ref type="bibr">Souza et al. (2013)</ref> describe innovation as an escape mechanism of isomorphism in the structures and a result of the search for similarity between innovative companies. The condition conceptualized in this topic allows us assert that the decision to equalize or innovate is crucial for the required changes. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> below sets out the elements that clarify the operation of the typology and the cognitive model of this relationship   </p></div>

Analysis of the impact of isomorphism from the perspective of Institutional Theory</p><p>This section assesses the impact of isomorphism from the perspective of institutional theory, which, among the organizational phenomena, is a crucial point to be respected by managers even when the government imposes standards aiming more and more to homogenize companies by isomorphic mechanisms. Thus, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> consolidates the most significant impacts observed by the writers listed above,in the relationship between isomorphism and institutional theory.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Institutional theory</head><p>It is understood as a management model with standardized behaviors and adherence to new trends, being a transformative process of beliefs and actions, resulting in behavioral patterning executed by mimetic pressures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homogeneity</head><p>It is understood as the standardization of procedures, becoming a copy of a standard and hence an imitation procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Environment</head><p>It is understood as the whole context of an organization, managed by a manager, with previously consolidated rules and procedures applied. It relates to anything that might influence the organization internally or externally, as well as the culture of the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coercion</head><p>It is understood as proposed legal means to homogenize procedures through coercion. Coercion is imposed for reasons arising from regulatory acceptance (government or civil authorities) or the internal rules of organizations.</p><p>Source: prepared by the author on the basis of Internet research.</p><p>Often, these isomorphic processes arise by means of coercive or persuasive elements imposed by the competent authorities, leading to the standardization of procedures; although it may allow the operational managersto have greater control, this procedure tends to reduce innovatory features a little.</p><p>Thus, the presentation of isomorphism before institutional theory brings dualityto managers, being seen tendentiouslyas a negative review by standardization, even though, corroborating Souza's idea (2013), this standardization may awaken the motive for innovation which mustbe set to oppose isomorphism in the generation of new services or organizational procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Taking the content analysis related to the proposed theme, the versatility of isomorphism may be observedboth in its proposal of standardization and in relation to innovationas demanding a change in focus.</p><p>The present study identifies a connection between isomorphism and innovation; with reference to the theoretical contribution, exposing selectively the conceptual proposals of several authors, and focusing on creative modelling for new solutions through Design Thinking. It is inferred that isomorphism is a way by which managers in organizations seek to copy the structures or actions of others so as to obtain greater visibility and competitiveness in a specific organizational field. However, innovation is a prominent feature by which firms can differentiate themselves for market competitiveness. It is an excellent way of changing organizational processes. These contributions further the continuity of this study with a view to finding the point of convergence between isomorphism and creative thinking, which can be achieved through the new tool of Design Thinking. This is a topic where much remains to study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>mental model showing the relationship of subject x object in the perception of isomorphism Source: prepared by the author based on BRAGA and PEDRO FILHO (2013).</figDesc></figure>
