<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Guidelines, directives, and policy statements are usually presented in "linear" text form-word after word, page after page. However necessary, this practice impedes full understanding, obscures feedback dynamics, hides mutual dependencies and cascading effects and the like-even when augmented with tables and diagrams. The net result is often a checklist response as an end in itself. All this creates barriers to intended realization of guidelines and undermines potential effectiveness. We present a solution strategy using text as "data", transforming text into a structured model, and generate network views of the text(s), that we then can use for vulnerability mapping, risk assessments, and control point analysis. For proof of concept, we draw on NIST conceptual model and analysis of guidelines for smart grid cybersecurity, more than 600 pages of text.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>As general practice, guidelines, directives, and policy documents are presented in text form, page-by-page and wordby-word-supported with figures, diagrams and tables as needed. Rooted in the legal tradition, this practice reinforces a linear logic, on in which where sequence appears to dominate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem</head><p>Cybersecurity policies are developing faster than their implementation. Barriers to implementation reduce the value of policies to protect systems (and users) from known vulnerabilities.</p><p>The cybersecurity policy ecosystem is complex: Enterprises are burdened by the need to identify and situate required directives. Policies are usually articulated in text form, as are descriptions of system-state. Text creates ambiguity for precise representation of a system as well as for accurate identification of vulnerabilities and impacts. Such a situation creates a dilemma for implementing what is to be done, why, when, where. By definition, text undermines any attention to feedback, delays, interconnections, cascading effects, indirect impacts and the like-all embedded deep into the idiom or structure of the textual form. The text-form may be necessary, but it is not sufficient. In fact, it may impede understanding, obscure the full nature of directives, and generate less than optimal results-all of which create impediments to the pursuit of effective outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Purpose</head><p>This paper presents a solution strategy that consists of deploying analytical tools to formal text for the purpose of capturing as much of the features and intents of policies and guidelines as possible.</p><p>Focusing on the salience of cybersecurity in both private and public sectors, we draw on major reports presented by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> in its efforts to improve cybersecurity. These reports provide analyses of system-state, risk assessments, probability metrics, as well as detailed annotations to help guide the user community.</p><p>In sum, this material is rich in content, based on considerable collective knowledge, and subjected to a careful scrutiny and evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Proof of Concept</head><p>This paper presents a proof of concept for our approach to analytics for cybersecurity policy of cyber-physical systems as well as operational methods to:</p><p>• Transend constraints of policy-as-text or system-as-text;</p><p>• Transform text into metrics;</p><p>• Use metrics to construct model of system-state (for the test case) based on system metrics;</p><p>• Create effective linkages among required policy directives for cybersecurity;</p><p>• Connect model of system-state to directives for implementation; and</p><p>• Target specific directive to specific system problempoint.</p><p>Specifically, the proof of concept focuses on the smart grid of electric power systems. Among the daunting challenges is that directives-for implementation of cybersecurity policy-are distributed across a policy ecosystem of multiple documents. The policy ecosystem must be created before any of the above noted operational steps are undertaken. In practice this generally means that we have to identify and consider all properties of the cyber-physical system, of the policy directives, and of their connections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Products</head><p>The expected result is a modular but integrated approach to policy recommendations that (i) efficiently conveys policy prescriptions within an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, (ii) provide different visual structures for "seeing" cyber policy strategies, and (iii) situate attendant trade-offs or limitation in framing strategies for cyber policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RESEARCH DESIGN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Design Overview</head><p>The research design, presented below, is in five steps and at a relatively high level of aggregation. To briefly note the steps in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1:</ref> 1) Identify Policy Ecosystem: The first step is to identify the policy ecosystem for cybersecurity, and to delineate the focus of analysis. Once the policy ecosystem is completed and partitioned for inquiry, then we turn to operational features of the research design. Here, we apply the structured method (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) to assist understanding of guidelines for smart grid cybersecurity as provided in NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>2) Create Linked Data: We view the smart grid logical reference model provided in NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> more as a synthesis of empirical evidence and examine its properties accordingly. By drawing on these documents we transform the basic text into a formal model of the entire system for the proof of concept (that is, the NIST "smart grid logical reference model").</p><p>3) Construct Design Structure Matrix (DSM) The linked data are converted into a DSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for matrix-based analysis. The full DSM allows us to "dig in deeper" or to focus in some segment thereof, as we show later on. Linked data are also used in the form of interactive tool(s) for on-demand, user-defined views of system properties. Such tools allow us to examine parts and pieces of the DSM for: (i) exploratory analyses of the smart grid system and (ii) drill down analyses of the same data set.</p><p>4) Construct Network Graphics: the Design Structure Matrix is then transformed into smart grid network graphics of the system as a whole and the connections among components. The network graphics capability is supported by data visualization and analysis tools.</p><p>5) Risk identification &amp; Assessment: All the above steps support the practice of cybersecurity risk management as well as the use of NIST Cybersecurity Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for enterprise purposes and customized to system operations.</p><p>Jointly, these tools assist users to address questions related to the what, when, where, who, why, how and how much for system cybersecurity, as well as questions related risks/vulnerabilities. For example, what are the cybersecurity requirements are applicable to a specific interface between two actors and with what impact levels? Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. High-level view of structured method for policy analysis of cybersecurity for a cyber-physical system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. POLICY ECOSYSTEM</head><p>There is little need for introduction of NIST, the premier standard setting entity in the nation and often for the international community as a whole.</p><p>In this study, we go beyond appreciating the contributions of NIST to viewing reports as a source of new knowledge, a basis for identifying risk, evaluating alternative courses of action, and facilitating prioritization in the deployment of corrective measures. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the results of the policy ecosystem relevant to the proof of concept and the scope of this investigation. The yellow shade identifies the policy documents that bear directly on this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Proof of Concept: Smart Grid for Electric Power Systems</head><p>Our focus of this study is smart grid-a ubiquitous feature of power systems-and its cybersecurity. We use the NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> on guidelines for smart grid cybersecurity-totaling Identify policy documents of cybersecurity imperatives, as well as, those specific to smart grid in electric power systems. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. NISTIR 7628: Guidelines for smart grid cybersecurity</head><p>While NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> contains almost all of the relevant information required to (i) map the smart grid security requirements for purposes of technical operations, business strategy and technology policy, and (ii) address the key challenges identified by GAO 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, however as a voluntary guideline it has the following limitations:</p><p>• NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is a comprehensive and very detailed record of the elements of smart grid that assist in the standard and agenda setting. But information is all text and distributed across a very large document.</p><p>• It may be a daunting challenge to fully understand the very detailed and often unfamiliar information in a report presented in three disparate volumes and focusing on technology, privacy, and IT security.</p><p>• The document itself refers to other documents that provide detailed information on a conceptual smart grid, its actors and activities, interfaces between actors, and their attributes -all in text form.</p><p>• The report does not allow extraction of information at different levels of abstraction due to the disconnected nature of the content adding further burden to anyone seeking to synthesize the content.</p><p>• So, too, the current form does not connect and address to the business objectives and organizational policies. It cannot be mapped to the technology policy and business strategy requirements due to highly technical nature of the content without relying on external literature for an end-to-end system view of cyber security.</p><p>While the report provides a detailed account of the elements of the smart grid and possible scenarios of failures, it does not provide any mapping to actors and interfaces involved in smart grid functions. Thus, limiting the ability to:</p><p>• Locate control points; and</p><p>• Measure current and future desired state of the technical landscape, business objectives and technology policy.</p><p>IV. LINKED DATA Using the NIST logical reference model provided in NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> as an entry point, following critical data are extracted to define the elements of the linked database. The consist of six distinct system properties, as follows:</p><p>1) Actor "...is a device, computer system, software program, or the individual or organization that participates in the smart grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>". NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> identified 49 such actors that are clustered into seven domains based on their role and responsibilities at the macro level.</p><p>2) Domains encompass smart grid conceptual roles and services. These include types of services, interactions, and stakeholders that make decisions and exchange information necessary for performing identified goals.</p><p>3) Logical Interfaces connect any two actors. NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> identified over 125 such interfaces between 49 actors. These interfaces are further aggregated tinto 22 Logical Interface Categories based on their technical requirements.</p><p>4) Impact Levels: Three levels of impact (low, moderate, high) are defined as the expected adverse effect of a security breach on system operations, system assets, or individuals for each security objective (confidentiality 2 , integrity 3 , and availability 4 ) as defined in US statute 44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>5) Security Requirements are applicable to any logical interface, based on impact level for each security objective. They are an amalgam located in different sources sources, notably: NIST SP 800-53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the DHS Catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and NERC CIP (Critical Infrastructure Plans) standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These requirements are organized into families primarily based on NIST SP 800-53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and are allocated to one of three categories (a-c) below: a) Governance, Risk, and Compliance Requirements that are addressed at organizational level. They are centered around policy, procedure, and compliance-based activities.</p><p>b) Common Technical Requirements that are applicable to all the logical interface categories. 2 Confidentiality is defined as "…preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>." 3 Integrity is defined as "…guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>." 4 Availability is defined as "…Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>." 6) System Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses which could adversely impact the operation of the electric grid that are categorized into people, policy, and procedure; platform software/firmware vulnerabilities; platform vulnerabilities; and network factors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission Specific Goals</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> provides a high-level view of the data collected from the NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This figure shows not only the value of the document, but the challenges for the reader to extract the relevant data and understand how sets of data are related to each other.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Operational view of linked data extracted from NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Inset: Individual count of observations within each data element.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DESIGN STUCTURE MATRIX (DSM)</head><p>DSM is an important venue for quantitative analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. It is a matrix-based information exchange tool for representing interactions between the elements or activities of a decomposed system.</p><p>The actors and logical interfaces in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> from NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are converted into a DSM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). By linking added information on impact levels and security requirements, DSM view helps to identify which actor or cluster of actors is more important than others. Such a view may help us to identify and understand where most of the effort is needed.  VI. NETWORK VIEWS Information provided in matrix form (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) and in linked data (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) is useful in its basic form, however its value can be further enhanced if it can be visualized and analyzed holistically at the systems level.</p><p>With the foundations in place the next step is to transform the DSM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) into network graphics supported by visualization/analysis tool(s).</p><p>The combination of graph theory and its underlying tools help transform the DSM into very informative and valuable Cumulatively these tools aid user in answering questions related to what, when, where, who, why, how, and how much of smart grid functions and their cybersecurity and questions related to mitigation of cybersecurity risks/vulnerabilities: We as: which Cybersecurity Requirements are applicable to an interface between two actors at what impact levels?</p><p>Using the DSM in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, we create a visual representation of the smart grid network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The results allow visual interpretation of the structure by turning structural proximities into visual proximities, thus facilitating analysis. Note: Nodes represent actors and an edge between any two nodes represents the logical interface between them, node color indicates domain of actor. This view is based on a force directed layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where nodes repulse each other like charged particles, while edges attract their nodes, like springs. The forcedirected layout drawing has the specificity of placing each node in a situation depending on the other nodes. This process depends only on connections between nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. RISK IDENTIFICATION &amp; ASSESSMENT</head><p>So far, we focused on retrieving the knowledge embedded in the text and, as needed.</p><p>The next set of steps focus on matters of risk (Step 5 of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), i.e., to examine the structure of the network and focus on those elements (actors/activities and interface between any two such actors/activities) for risk assessments that are central to the user's interests, and, to meet the statutory requirements for cybersecurity, for example, implementing NIST Cyber Security Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparative Analysis of Nodes</head><p>The core network view can be used to create additional views by resizing nodes by node/actor centrality measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> as follows:</p><p>1) Eigenvector centrality: Importance of a node in the network based on the coupling with other high-ranking neighboring nodes.</p><p>2) Betweenness Centrality: Focus on how important a node is in terms of connecting other nodes.</p><p>3) Closeness Centrality: Focus on how easily other nodes can reach a node.</p><p>4) Closeness Centrality: Degree Centrality: Measures how a node is connected to others.</p><p>For this paper, we use eigenvector centrality, where node centrality is determined by the centrality of its neighbors. It is not node centrality itself that matters, it is the centrality of the nodes linked to it. The circularity of the argument is evident but can understood using matrix algebra [28].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparative Analysis Based on Impact Level</head><p>The information provided in the NISTIR 7628 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> report is then compiled for the impact of any risk/vulnerability on the interfaces between any two actors/activities of the smart grid for three key security objectives-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authority.</p><p>Edge color is used here to represent the impact level on the smart grid based on three security objectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparative Analysis Based on Security Requirements</head><p>Next, the edge width is resized based on the count of security requirements to secure the logical interface. recommended for each of the three security objectives and impact levels. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> presents the 3x3 view of impact level (low, moderate, high) and count of security requirements for all three security objectives throughout the network. All the visuals in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> are based on exactly the same data or information, but they differ considerably in explanatory value.</p><p>Of course, the network views are possible only because of the NIST conceptual view that helps direct the analysis to the relevant supporting tables so essential for building the DSM. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Consolidating 3x3 Views</head><p>While the information in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> is of direct relevance to the user or enterprise, it is not particularly useful for operational purposes. The figure is too detailed to facilitate effective action. Further it serves as a disincentive to action. Of course, the user can "drill down" or "zoom in" to examine further.</p><p>We now aggregate the information in 3x3 to a single image by selecting the worst impact level for a logical interface (represented by the edge color) and aggregating the count of security requirements (represented by edge width) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Tools for N-x Contingency Analysis</head><p>This paper addresses N-1 vulnerabilities, i.e., analysis of vulnerabilities is limited to node or edge. However, analysis of second and higher degrees of impact on the network and who else may be impacted should the actors or logical interface fail or are compromised will help in reviewing the other components that need to secure to limit the loss.</p><p>The network structure and matrix representation enable analysis of multiple vulnerabilities or multiple "N-x" levels of vulnerabilities to be analyzed It has the capability for exploring how vulnerability in one node or edge impacts resources beyond its means or privileges. It identifies the second degree of impact  that the network may have and who else may be impacted should the actors or logical interface fails/compromised. This will help in reviewing the other components of the system that need to be secured to limit loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. ENTERPRISE APPLICATION</head><p>If an enterprise uses our method of linked database and seeks to customize the results for its own system properties, then it must incorporate its own enterprise-specific knowledge into the essential structure of cybersecurity directives. This means that an enterprise must:</p><p>A. Map its own system to NIST "as-is" system Given that our work is based on a sector independent framework and guideline documents, any enterprise that uses the method will need to map its own system components and policies to the relevant reference documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Identify system specific vulnerabilities</head><p>Based on enterprise mapping, an enterprise will also need to develop an assessment of the threat landscape, as well as the vulnerabilities identified, and known by, the system owners.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the methods we developed, and the tools provided, would greatly facilitate the tasks of the enterprise as it seeks to comply with security guidelines.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
