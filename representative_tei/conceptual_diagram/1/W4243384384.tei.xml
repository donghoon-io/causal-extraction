<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCLAIMER</head><p>This document has been prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and describes standards research coordination activities in support of its mandate under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA).</p><p>Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe a concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor is it intended to imply that these entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive Summary</head><p>Background A 21 st century clean energy economy demands a 21 st century electric grid. Much of the traditional electricity infrastructure has changed little from the design and form of the electric grid as envisioned by Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse at the end of the 19 th century.</p><p>Congress and the Administration have outlined a vision for the Smart Grid and have laid the policy foundation upon which it is being built. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) made it the policy of the United States to modernize the nation's electricity transmission and distribution system to create a smart electric grid. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) accelerated the development of Smart Grid technologies, investing $4.5 billion for electricity delivery and energy reliability activities to modernize the electric grid and implement demonstration and deployment programs (as authorized under Title XIII of EISA). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> President Obama, in his State of the Union Address, reiterated his vision for a clean energy economy, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and he underscored the Administration's commitment in the "Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future." <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In June 2011, the White House released a report by the Cabinetlevel National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) entitled "A Policy Framework for the 21st Century Grid: Enabling Our Secure Energy Future." <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The critical role of standards for the Smart Grid is spelled out in EISA and in the June 2011 NSTC report, which advocates the development and adoption of standards to ensure that today's investments in the Smart Grid remain valuable in the future; to catalyze innovations; to support consumer choice; to create economies of scale to reduce costs; to highlight best practices; and to open global markets for Smart Grid devices and systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role and Response of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</head><p>EISA assigns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability <ref type="bibr">6</ref> of Smart Grid devices and systems…." <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In response to the urgent need to establish interoperability standards and protocols for the Smart Grid, NIST developed a three-phase plan: I) To accelerate the identification and consensus on Smart Grid standards; II) To establish a robust Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) that sustains the development of the many additional standards that will be needed; and III) To create a conformity testing and certification infrastructure.</p><p>Beginning in 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, NIST convened workshops and meetings that brought together experts and a diverse group of stakeholders to begin the implementation of the three-phase plan. By the end of 2009, significant progress and consensus had been achieved in developing a roadmap and identifying an initial set of standards (Phase I of the NIST plan). The publication in January 2010 of the NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 1.0 (Release 1.0)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> represented an important milestone and documented the progress made up to that time.</p><p>Release 1.0 of the NIST Framework described a high-level conceptual reference model for the Smart Grid, identified 75 existing standards that are applicable (or likely to be applicable) to the ongoing development of the Smart Grid, specified 15 high-priority gaps and harmonization issues for which new or revised standards and requirements are needed, documented action plans with aggressive timelines by which designated standards development organizations (SDOs) and standards-setting organizations (SSOs) will address these gaps, and described the strategy to establish requirements and standards to help ensure Smart Grid cybersecurity.</p><p>The SGIP was established to further the development of consensus-based Smart Grid interoperability standards. NIST staff hold key technical positions in the SGIP, including Chair of the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG), Vice Chair of the Testing and Certification Committee (TCC), Chair or Co-chair of the Building-to-Grid (B2G), Industrial-to-Grid (I2G), Home-to-Grid (H2G), Transmission and Distribution (TnD), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Business and Policy (BnP), Distributed Renewables, Generation, and Storage (DRGS) Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs), and each of the 19 PAPs. NIST leadership on these committees and working groups provides strong support for the acceleration of the standards necessary for the safe, secure, and reliable Smart Grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content of Framework 2.0</head><p>This document, Release 2.0 of the NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, details progress made in Phases II and III of NIST's three-phase plan since the establishment of the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) in November 2009.</p><p>Major deliverables have been produced in the areas of Smart Grid architecture, cybersecurity, and testing and certification. The lists of standards, Tables 4-1 and 4-2, have been updated and expanded. The first group of Smart Grid standards to emerge from the SGIP Priority Action Plans (PAPs), filling gaps identified in Release 1.0, were added to the list of identified Smart Grid standards. The listed standards have undergone an extensive vetting process and are expected to stand the "test of time" as useful building blocks for firms producing devices and software for the Smart Grid, as well as for utilities, regulators, academia, and other Smart Grid stakeholders. Sidebars 1 and 2 below ("What's Included in Release 2.0" and "What's New in Release 2.0") provide additional summary information about the contents of this document.</p><p>The reference model, standards, gaps, and action plans described in this document provide a solid foundation for a secure, interoperable Smart Grid. However, the Smart Grid will continually evolve as new requirements and technologies emerge. The processes established by the SGIP, engaging the diverse community of Smart Grid stakeholders, provide a robust ongoing mechanism to develop requirements to guide the standardization efforts now spanning more than 20 standards-setting organizations.</p><p>The results of NIST's ongoing work on standards for the Smart Grid reflected in this framework document provide input to industry utilities, vendors, academia, regulators, integrators and developers, and other Smart Grid stakeholders. Among the stakeholder groups who may find this Release 2.0 document most useful are the following:</p><p>• Utilities and suppliers concerned with how best to understand and implement the Smart Grid (especially Chapters 3, 4, and 6);</p><p>• Testing laboratories and certification organizations (especially Chapter 7);</p><p>• Academia (especially Section 5.5 and Chapter 8); and</p><p>• Regulators (especially Chapters 1, 4, and 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Next Steps</head><p>Execution of the Priority Action Plans presently under way will continue until their objectives to fill identified gaps in the standards portfolio have been accomplished. As new gaps and requirements are identified, the SGIP will continue to initiate Priority Action Plans to address them. Many of the Department of Energy (DOE) Smart Grid Investment Grant projects, funded by ARRA as mentioned above, will come to fruition in the near future. In their proposals, awardees were required to describe how the projects would support the NIST Framework. As experience with new Smart Grid technologies is gained from these projects, NIST and the SGIP will use these "lessons learned" to further identify the gaps and shortcomings of the standards upon which these technologies are based. NIST and the SGIP will work with SDOs, SSOs, and other stakeholders to fill the gaps and improve the standards that form the foundation of the Smart Grid.</p><p>Work on the SGIP Catalog of Standards will continue to fully populate the Catalog and ensure robust architectural and cybersecurity reviews of the standards. The cybersecurity guidelines will be kept up to date to stay ahead of emerging new threats. Efforts will continue to establish partnerships with the private sector for the creation of testing and certification programs consistent with the SGIP testing and certification framework. This work will also ensure coordination with related international Smart Grid standards efforts, maintaining U.S. leadership going forward.</p><p>NIST will continue to support the needs of regulators as they address standardization matters in the regulatory arena. Under EISA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is charged with instituting rulemaking proceedings to adopt the standards and protocols as may be necessary to ensure Smart Grid functionality and interoperability once, in FERC's judgment, the NIST-coordinated process has led to sufficient consensus. 9 FERC obtained public input through two Technical Conferences on Smart Grid Interoperability Standards in November 2010 and January 2011, 10 and through a supplemental notice requesting comments in February 2011. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> As a result, FERC issued an order in July 2011 <ref type="bibr">12</ref> stating that there was insufficient consensus for it to institute a rulemaking at that time to adopt the initial five families of standards identified by NIST as ready for consideration by regulators. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In that July 2011 order, however, FERC expressed support for the NIST interoperability framework process, including the work done by the SGIP, for development of Smart Grid interoperability standards. The Commission's order stated that the NIST Framework is comprehensive and represents the best vehicle for developing standards for the Smart Grid. FERC's order also encourages stakeholders to actively participate and look to the NISTcoordinated process for guidance on Smart Grid standards. NIST supported the Commission's order, which notes that "In its comments, NIST suggests that the Commission could send appropriate signals to the marketplace by recommending use of the NIST Framework without mandating compliance with particular standards. NIST adds that it would be impractical and unnecessary for the Commission to adopt individual interoperability standards." <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Although the NIST framework and roadmap effort is the product of federal legislation, broad engagement of Smart Grid stakeholders at the state and local levels is essential to ensure the consistent voluntary application of the standards being developed. Currently, many states and 11 <ref type="url" target="http://ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110228084004-supplemental-notice.pdf">http://ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110228084004-supplemental-notice.pdf</ref>.</p><p>12 <ref type="url" target="http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110719143912-RM11-2-000.pdf">http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110719143912-RM11-2-000.pdf</ref>. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> These standards include IEC 61850, 61970, 61968, 60870-6, and 62351. To find more information about these standards, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-1 in Section 4.3.</p><p>14 See reference <ref type="url" target="http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110719143912-RM11-2-000.pdf">http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110719143912-RM11-2-000.pdf</ref>, p. 6.</p><p>their utility commissions are pursuing Smart Grid-related projects. Ultimately, state and local projects will converge into fully functioning elements of the Smart Grid "system of systems." Therefore, the interoperability and cybersecurity standards developed under the NIST framework and roadmap must support the role of the states in modernizing the nation's electric grid. The NIST framework can provide a valuable input to regulators as they consider the prudency of investments proposed by utilities.</p><p>A key objective of NIST's effort is to create a self-sustaining, ongoing standards process that supports continuous innovation as grid modernization continues in the decades to come. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Grid modernization should ensure backward compatibility to the greatest extent practical. NIST envisions that the processes being put in place by the SGIP, as they mature, will provide the mechanism to evolve the Smart Grid standards framework as new requirements and technologies emerge. The SGIP processes will also evolve and improve as experience is gained.</p><p>Chapter 5, "Smart Grid Interoperability Panel," presents the mission and structure of the SGIP.</p><p>The SGIP is a membership-based organization established to identify, prioritize, and address new and emerging requirements for Smart Grid standards. Working as a public-private partnership, the SGIP provides an open process for stakeholders to interact with NIST in the ongoing coordination, acceleration, and harmonization of standards development for the Smart Grid.</p><p>Chapter 6, "Cybersecurity Strategy," provides an overview of the content of the NIST Interagency Report 7628, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cyber Security (NISTIR 7628), and outlines the go-forward strategy of the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG). Cybersecurity is now being expanded to address the following: combined power systems; information technology (IT) and communication systems in order to maintain the reliability of the Smart Grid; the physical security of all components; the reduced impact of coordinated cyber-physical attacks; and the privacy of consumers.</p><p>Chapter 7, "Testing and Certification," provides details on an assessment of existing Smart Grid standards testing programs, and it offers high-level guidance for the development of a testing and certification framework. This chapter includes a comprehensive roadmap and operational framework for how testing and certification of the Smart Grid devices will be conducted.</p><p>Chapter 8, "Next Steps" contains a high-level overview of some of the currently foreseen areas of interest to the Smart Grid community, including electromagnetic disturbance and interference, reliability and "implementability" of standards.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 8</head><p>This chapter, as compared to Chapter 7 ("Next Steps") in Release 1.0, reflects the evolving and advancing work of NIST in the area of Smart Grid interoperability standards. One issue mentioned briefly in Release 1.0-"Electromagnetic Disturbances and Interference"-is discussed in more detail in this chapter of Release 2.0. (Section 8.1.1.) One new issue-"Reliability, Implementability, and Safety of Framework Standards"-is introduced and discussed in this chapter of Release 2.0. (Section 8.1.2.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Purpose and Scope</head><p>Overview and Background 1.1.</p><p>Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was assigned "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems…" [EISA Section 1305] <ref type="bibr">16</ref> There is an urgent need to establish Smart Grid 17 standards and protocols. Some Smart Grid devices, such as smart meters, are being widely deployed. Installation of synchrophasors, sensors that provide real-time assessments of power system health to provide system operators with better information for averting disastrous outages, has accelerated rapidly. By 2013, it is expected that approximately 1,000 of these devices will monitor conditions on the power grid, a dramatic increase since January 2009. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> In late October 2009, President Obama announced 100 Smart Grid Investment Grant Program awards totaling $3.4 billion. This federal investment leveraged an additional $4.7 billion in commitments from private companies, utilities, cities, and other partners that are forging ahead with plans to install Smart Grid technologies and enable an array of efficiency-maximizing and performance-optimizing applications. At the end of 2009, the number of Smart Grid projects in the United States exceeded 130 projects spread across 44 states and two territories. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Federal loan guarantees for commercial renewable energy generation projects, <ref type="bibr">20</ref> growing venture capital investments in Smart Grid technologies, and other incentives and investments provide <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The Department of Energy (DOE) is the lead federal agency with responsibility for the Smart Grid. Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), DOE has sponsored cost-shared Smart Grid investment grants, demonstration projects, and other R&amp;D efforts. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is tasked with initiating rulemakings for adoption of Smart Grid standards as necessary to ensure functionality and interoperability when it determines that the standards identified in the NIST framework development efforts have sufficient consensus. See Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> While recognizing that the different names used for the future grid have meaningful distinctions to some stakeholders, this report generally uses the term "Smart Grid." The capitalized version of the term is used in Title XIII of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. NIST recognizes that lower-case versions of the term also appear in the Act. The decision to use Smart Grid is not intended to discount or supersede other terms used to describe a modernized grid that enables bidirectional flows of energy and uses two-way communication and control capabilities that will lead to an array of new functionalities and applications. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Vice President Biden, Memorandum for the President, "Progress Report: The Transformation to a Clean Energy Economy," Dec. 15, 2009.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NIST Plan for Interoperability Standards</head><p>To carry out its EISA-assigned responsibilities, NIST devised a three-phase plan to rapidly identify an initial set of standards, while providing a robust process for continued development and implementation of standards as needs and opportunities arise and as technology advances.</p><p>• (Phase 1): Engage stakeholders in a participatory public process to identify applicable standards and requirements, gaps in currently available standards, and priorities for additional standardization activities. With the support of outside technical experts working under contract, NIST compiled and incorporated stakeholder inputs from three public workshops, as well as technical contributions from technical working groups and a Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG, originally named the Cybersecurity Coordination Task Group, or CSCTG), into the NIST-coordinated standards roadmapping effort.</p><p>• (Phase 2): Establish a Smart Grid Interoperability Panel forum to drive longer-term progress. A representative, reliable, and responsive organizational forum is needed to sustain continued development of the framework of interoperability standards. On November 19, 2009, a Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) was launched to serve this function and has now grown to over 675 organizations comprising over 1790 members.</p><p>• (Phase 3): Develop and implement a framework for conformity testing and certification. Testing and certification of how standards are implemented in Smart Grid devices, systems, and processes are essential to ensure interoperability and security under realistic operating conditions. NIST, in consultation with stakeholders, initiated and completed two major efforts in 2010: (1) performed an assessment of existing Smart Grid standards testing programs; and (2) provided high-level guidance for the development of a testing and certification framework. A permanent Smart Grid Testing and Certification Committee (SGTCC) was established within the SGIP. The SGTCC has assumed the responsibility for constructing an operational framework, as well as the action plans for development of documentation and associated artifacts supporting testing and certification programs that support Smart Grid interoperability.</p><p>innovation and the realization of promising applications, such as smart appliances that are responsive to price and demand response signals.</p><p>Development of a standard, however, is not a one-time project. Once initially developed, they are reviewed and revised periodically in a continual process of maturing. The standards contained in the NIST Framework are in various stages of maturity. The activities of the SGIP also support this continuous development to improve the standards.</p><p>Moreover, standards enable economies of scale and scope that help to create competitive markets in which vendors compete on the basis of a combination of price and quality. Market competition promotes faster diffusion of Smart Grid technologies and realization of customer benefits. A recent report summarizing a number of consumer studies found that "concern over climate change, energy security, and global competitiveness have made more consumers receptive to learning about energy." <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Among the potential benefits of the Smart Grid, consumers saw three as being "best benefits":</p><p>• Detect power outages;</p><p>• Reduce brownouts or voltage sags; and</p><p>• Integrate renewable energy sources. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Another national survey indicated that most U.S. consumers are favorably disposed toward anticipated household-level benefits made possible by Smart Grid technologies and capabilities. Three-fourths of those surveyed said, they are "likely to change their energy use in order to save money on their utility bills if they were given new technology solutions." A similar percentage said, they "would like their utility to help them reduce energy consumption." <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Another survey noted that consumers wanted:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">foot_9</ref> </p><p>• Lights that turn off automatically when they leave the room;</p><p>• Thermostats that automatically adjust for savings when no one is home;</p><p>• Information about which devices are using the most electricity; and</p><p>• Recommendations for saving energy and money.</p><p>The release of the NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 1.0 26 was the first output of the NIST plan. It described a high-level conceptual reference model for the Smart Grid which: identified 75 existing standards that are applicable (or likely to be applicable) to the ongoing development of the Smart Grid; specified 15 high-priority gaps and harmonization issues (in addition to cybersecurity) for which new or revised standards and requirements are needed; documented action plans with aggressive timelines by which designated standards-setting organizations (SSOs) will address these gaps; and described the strategy to establish requirements and standards to help ensure Smart Grid cybersecurity. This document is the second installment in an ongoing standards coordination and harmonization process. Ultimately, this process will deliver the hundreds of communication protocols, standard interfaces, and other widely accepted and adopted technical specifications necessary to build an advanced, secure electric power grid with two-way communication and control capabilities. This document serves to guide the work of the SGIP and support the safety, reliability, and security of the grid. As of July 2011, there are over 740 member organizations and over 1,900 member representatives in 22 Smart Grid stakeholder categories; 29 of these member representatives are from Canada and 58 more are from other countries, including China. The SGIP provides an open process for stakeholders to participate in providing input and cooperating with NIST in the ongoing coordination, acceleration, and harmonization of standards development for the Smart Grid.</p><p>In conjunction with and integral to this process, NIST is coordinating the development of a Smart Grid cybersecurity framework and strategy, through the SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG). This work was begun prior to the establishment of the SGIP and is now a part of the SGIP's ongoing work. The CSWG currently comprises more than 550 technical experts.</p><p>Results of the group's work are included in a companion Smart Grid document, NIST Interagency Report 7628, Guidelines to Smart Grid Cyber Security (NISTIR 7628), issued in September, 2010. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> The Smart Grid cybersecurity framework and strategy will be completed in collaboration with the SGIP and its CSWG.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use of this Framework 1.2.</head><p>The results of NIST's ongoing technical work reflected in this framework document should assist industry utilities, vendors, academia, regulators, system integrators and developers, and other Smart Grid stakeholders in future decision making. This document includes a compendium of standards that, in NIST's engineering judgment, are foundational to the Smart Grid. Standards identified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">4-1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref>-2, below, have gone through an extensive vetting process, including the workshops and public comment on Release 1.0 described in the previous section , and are expected to stand the "test of time" as useful building blocks for firms producing devices and software for the Smart Grid, as well as for utilities, regulators, academia, and other Smart Grid stakeholders.</p><p>For Release 2.0, standards moved onto the list of identified standards, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-1, are standards that have been reviewed through the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS) process, recommended by the SGIP Governing Board (SGIP GB), and approved by the SGIP plenary. This process will continue as it is intended that all of the standards identified in Release 1.0 will be reviewed by the SGIP for the CoS. The CoS is further discussed in Sections 4.3, 4.5, and 5.3.</p><p>The standards, however, are not static, and these tables include information on and web links to present and anticipated future changes to the standards. As they mature, these standards are undergoing revisions to add new functionalities to them, integrate them with legacy standards, harmonize them with overlapping standards, and remedy shortcomings that are revealed as their implementations undergo interoperability testing. The new testing and certification chapter includes information on efforts now under way to enable vendors and other Smart Grid stakeholders to certify the interoperability of devices being considered for a specific Smart Grid deployment.</p><p>Among the stakeholder groups who will find this document most useful are the following:</p><p>• For utilities and suppliers concerned with how best to understand and implement the Smart Grid, the document provides a conceptual architectural framework to guide implementations (Chapter 3), a compendium of reference standards (Chapter 4), an introduction to the extensive body of work newly available from NIST concerning Smart Grid privacy and security (Chapter 6), and a taxonomy of the various Smart Grid domains (Chapter 10).</p><p>• For testing laboratories and certification organizations, the new testing and certification chapter (Chapter 7) provides updates on efforts now under way to enable vendors and other Smart Grid stakeholders to certify the interoperability of devices being considered for a specific Smart Grid deployment;</p><p>• For those in academia, this document provides a benchmark of considerable progress made in advancing the hundreds of standards required for the Smart Grid. In addition, Chapter 8 and summaries of various PAP subgroup efforts in Chapter 5 point to additional research and innovation needed to fill gaps in our collective understanding of the tools, systems, and policies needed to deploy and manage what will be the largest single network yet deployed in the United States; and</p><p>• For regulators, the framework serves as a general introduction to both the challenge and promise of the Smart Grid (Executive Summary and Chapter 1), a guide to workable standards useful to delivering the best value for consumers by ensuring that technical investments by energy providers utilize standards wisely (Chapter 4), and an introduction to extensive work now under way through the SGIP's CSWG considering Smart Grid privacy and security matters (Chapter 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Concepts 1.3.</head><p>The expedited development of an interoperability framework and a roadmap for underpinning standards, such as those outlined in this document, is a fundamental aspect of the overall transformation to a Smart Grid infrastructure. Although electric utilities are ultimately responsible for the safe and reliable operation of the grid, many other participants will be involved in the evolution of the existing electric power infrastructure. Technical contributions from numerous stakeholder communities will be required to realize an interoperable, secure Smart Grid.</p><p>Because of the diversity of technical and industrial perspectives involved, most participants in the roadmapping effort are familiar with only subsets of Smart Grid-related standards. Few have detailed knowledge of all pertinent standards, even in their own industrial and technical area. To facilitate broad and balanced input from all Smart Grid stakeholders, the SGIP<ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">foot_12</ref> was established:</p><p>• To create a forum with balanced stakeholder governance that would bring together stakeholders with expertise in the many various areas necessary for the Smart Grid, including areas such as power engineering, communications, information technology (IT), and systems engineering;</p><p>• To support development of consensus for Smart Grid interoperability standards; and</p><p>• To provide a source of expert input for the interoperability standards framework and roadmap.</p><p>This report contributes to an increased understanding of the key elements critical to realization of the Smart Grid, including standards-related priorities, strengths and weaknesses of individual standards, the level of effective interoperability among different Smart Grid domains, and cybersecurity requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1.">Definitions</head><p>Different stakeholders may hold a variety of definitions for the important terms that appear throughout the roadmap. To facilitate clear stakeholder discourse, NIST used the following definitions for the key terms below:</p><p>Architecture: The conceptual structure and overall organization of the Smart Grid from the point of view of its use or design. This includes technical and business designs, demonstrations, implementations, and standards that together convey a common understanding of the Smart Grid. The architecture embodies high-level principles and requirements that designs of Smart Grid applications and systems must satisfy. 29</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Energy Service Interface (ESI):</head><p>The device or application that functions as the gateway between the energy providers and consumers. Located on the consumer side of the exchange, this can have many forms. Its purpose is to facilitate communications between the consumer devices and the energy provider.</p><p>Functional Requirement: A requirement that specifies a function that a system or system component must be able to perform. 30</p><p>Harmonization: The process of achieving technical equivalency and enabling interchangeability between different standards with overlapping functionality. Harmonization requires an architecture that documents key points of interoperability and associated interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interoperability:</head><p>The capability of two or more networks, systems, devices, applications, or components to interwork, and to exchange and readily use information-securely, effectively, and with little or no inconvenience to the user. The Smart Grid will be a system of interoperable systems; that is, different systems will be able to exchange meaningful, actionable information in support of the safe, secure, efficient, and reliable operations of electric systems. The systems will share a common meaning of the exchanged information, and this information will elicit agreed-upon types of response. The reliability, fidelity, and security of information exchanges between and among Smart Grid systems must achieve requisite performance levels. 31</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interchangeability:</head><p>The ability of two or more components to be interchanged through mutual substitution without degradation in system performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mature Standard:</head><p>A mature standard is a standard that has been in use for long enough that most of its initial faults and inherent problems have been removed or reduced by further development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Functional Requirement:</head><p>A non-functional requirement is a statement that specifies a constraint about how a system must behave to meet functional requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability:</head><p>The ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time. It is often measured as a probability of failure or a measure of availability. However, maintainability is also an important part of reliability engineering. In addition to reliability of information technology, it covers power system equipment and reliability requirements of electric utilities.</p><p>Requirement: 1) A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective. 2) A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">foot_13</ref> </p><p>Standards: Specifications that establish the fitness of a product for a particular use or that define the function and performance of a device or system. Standards are key facilitators of compatibility and interoperability. They define specifications for languages, communication protocols, data formats, linkages within and across systems, interfaces between software applications and between hardware devices, and much more. Standards must be robust so that they can be extended to accommodate future applications and technologies. An assortment of organizations develops voluntary standards and specifications, which are the results of processes that vary on the basis of the type of organization and its purpose. These organizations include, but are not limited to, standards development organizations (SDOs), standards-setting organizations (SSOs), and user groups.</p><p>Additional terms pertinent to cybersecurity and to other important security-related considerations relevant to the safety, reliability, and overall performance of the Smart Grid and its components are defined in the Guidelines to Smart Grid Cyber Security (NISTIR 7628<ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">foot_14</ref> ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2.">Applications and Requirements: Eight Priority Areas</head><p>The Smart Grid will ultimately require hundreds of standards. Some are more urgently needed than others. To prioritize its work, NIST chose to focus on six key functionalities plus cybersecurity and network communications. These functionalities are especially critical to ongoing and near-term deployments of Smart Grid technologies and services, and they include the priorities recommended by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in its policy statement:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_15">foot_15</ref> </p><p>• Demand response and consumer energy efficiency: Mechanisms and incentives for utilities, business, industrial, and residential customers to cut energy use during times of peak demand or when power reliability is at risk. Demand response is necessary for optimizing the balance of power supply and demand. With increased access to detailed energy consumption information, consumers can also save energy with efficiency behavior and investments that achieve measurable results. In addition, they can learn where they may benefit with additional energy efficiency investments.</p><p>• Wide-area situational awareness: Monitoring and display of power-system components and performance across interconnections and over large geographic areas in near real time.</p><p>The goals of situational awareness are to understand and ultimately optimize the management of power-network components, behavior, and performance, as well as to anticipate, prevent, or respond to problems before disruptions arise.</p><p>• Energy storage: Means of storing energy, directly or indirectly. The most common bulk energy storage technology used today is pumped hydroelectric storage technology. New storage capabilities-especially for distributed storage-would benefit the entire grid, from generation to end use.</p><p>• Electric transportation: Refers primarily to enabling large-scale integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Electric transportation could significantly reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, increase use of renewable sources of energy, and dramatically reduce the nation's carbon footprint.</p><p>• Network communications: Refers to a variety of public and private communication networks, both wired and wireless, that will be used for Smart Grid domains and subdomains. Given this variety of networking environments, the identification of performance metrics and core operational requirements of different applications, actors, and domains-in addition to the development, implementation, and maintenance of appropriate security and access controls-is critical to the Smart Grid. FERC notes, a "… cross-cutting issue is the need for a common semantic framework (i.e., agreement as to meaning) and software models for enabling effective communication and coordination across inter-system interfaces. An interface is a point where two systems need to exchange data with each other; effective communication and coordination occurs when each of the systems understands and can respond to the data provided by the other system, even if the internal workings of the system are quite different."<ref type="foot" target="#foot_16">foot_16</ref> See Section 3.4 for further discussion on information networks.</p><p>• Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI): Provides near real-time monitoring of power usage, and is a current focus of utilities. These advanced metering networks are of many different designs and could also be used to implement residential demand response including dynamic pricing. AMI consists of the communications hardware and software, and the associated system and data management software, that together create a two-way network between advanced meters and utility business systems, enabling collection and distribution of information to customers and other parties, such as the competitive retail supplier or the utility itself. Because the networks do not share a common format, NIST is helping to coordinate the development of standard information data models.</p><p>• Distribution grid management: Focuses on maximizing performance of feeders, transformers, and other components of networked distribution systems and integrating them with transmission systems and customer operations. As Smart Grid capabilities, such as AMI and demand response are developed, and as large numbers of distributed energy resources and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are deployed, the automation of distribution systems becomes increasingly more important to the efficient and reliable operation of the overall power system. The anticipated benefits of distribution grid management include increased reliability, reductions in peak loads, increased efficiency of the distribution system, and improved capabilities for managing distributed sources of renewable energy. 36</p><p>• Cybersecurity: Encompasses measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic information communication systems and the control systems necessary for the management, operation, and protection of the Smart Grid's energy, information technology, and telecommunications infrastructures. 37 certification framework. This chapter includes a comprehensive roadmap and operational framework for how testing and certification of Smart Grid devices will be conducted.</p><p>Chapter 8, "Next Steps," contains a high-level overview of some of the anticipated areas of interest to the Smart Grid community, including electromagnetic disturbance and interference, and the "implementability" of standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Smart Grid Visions</head><p>Overview 2.1.</p><p>In the United States and many other countries, modernization of the electric power grid is central to national efforts to increase reliability and energy efficiency, transition to renewable sources of energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and build a sustainable economy that ensures prosperity for future generations. Globally, billions of dollars are spent to build elements of what ultimately will be "smart" electric power grids.</p><p>Definitions and terminology vary somewhat, but whether called "Smart," "smart," "smarter," or even "supersmart," all notions of an advanced power grid for the 21st century hinge on adding and integrating many varieties of digital computing and communication technologies and services with the power-delivery infrastructure. Bidirectional flows of energy and two-way communication and control capabilities will enable an array of new functionalities and applications that go well beyond "smart" meters for homes and businesses. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), which directed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to coordinate development of this framework and roadmap, states that national policy supports the creation of a Smart Grid. Distinguishing characteristics of the Smart Grid cited in EISA include: <ref type="bibr">38</ref> • Increased use of digital information and controls technology to improve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid;</p><p>• Dynamic optimization of grid operations and resources, with full cybersecurity;</p><p>• Deployment and integration of distributed resources and generation, including renewable resources;</p><p>• Development and incorporation of demand response, demand-side resources, and energyefficiency resources;</p><p>• Deployment of ''smart'' technologies for metering, communications concerning grid operations and status, and distribution automation;</p><p>• Integration of ''smart'' appliances and consumer devices;</p><p>• Deployment and integration of advanced electricity storage and peak-shaving technologies, including plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and thermal-storage air conditioning;</p><p>• Provision to consumers of timely information and control options;</p><p>• Development of standards for communication and interoperability of appliances and equipment connected to the electric grid, including the infrastructure serving the grid; and</p><p>• Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary barriers to adoption of Smart Grid technologies, practices, and services.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which leads the overall federal Smart Grid effort, summarized the anticipated advantages enabled by the Smart Grid in its June 25, 2009, funding opportunity announcement. The DOE statement explicitly recognizes the important enabling role of an underpinning standards infrastructure:</p><p>The applications of advanced digital technologies (i.e., microprocessor-based measurement and control, communications, computing, and information systems) are expected to greatly improve the reliability, security, interoperability, and efficiency of the electric grid, while reducing environmental impacts and promoting economic growth.</p><p>Achieving enhanced connectivity and interoperability will require innovation, ingenuity, and different applications, systems, and devices to operate seamlessly with one another, involving the combined use of open system architecture, as an integration platform, and commonly-shared technical standards and protocols for communications and information systems. To realize Smart Grid capabilities, deployments must integrate a vast number of smart devices and systems. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> To monitor and assess the progress of deployments in the United States, DOE tracks activities grouped under six chief characteristics of the envisioned Smart Grid: 40</p><p>• Enables informed participation by customers;</p><p>• Accommodates all generation and storage options;</p><p>• Enables new products, services, and markets;</p><p>• Provides the power quality for the range of needs;</p><p>• Optimizes asset utilization and operating efficiently; and</p><p>• Operates resiliently to disturbances, attacks, and natural disasters.</p><p>Interoperability and cybersecurity standards identified under the NIST-coordinated process in cooperation with DOE will underpin component, system-level, and network-wide performance in each of these six important areas.</p><p>The framework described in EISA lists several important characteristics. These characteristics stipulate: 41</p><p>• That the framework be "flexible, uniform and technology neutral, including but not limited to technologies for managing Smart Grid information";</p><p>• That it "be designed to accommodate traditional, centralized generation and transmission resources and consumer distributed resources";</p><p>• That it be "designed to be flexible to incorporate regional and organizational differences; and technological innovations"; and • That it be "designed to consider the use of voluntary uniform standards for certain classes of mass-produced electric appliances and equipment for homes and businesses that enable customers, at their election and consistent with applicable State and Federal laws, and are manufactured with the ability to respond to electric grid emergencies and demand response signals'; and that "such voluntary standards should incorporate appropriate manufacturer lead time."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance to National Energy Policy Goals 2.2.</head><p>The Smart Grid is a vital component of President Obama's comprehensive energy plan, which aims to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, to create jobs, and to help U.S. industry compete successfully in global markets for clean energy technology. The President has set ambitious short-and long-term goals, necessitating sustained progress in implementing the components, systems, and networks that will make up the Smart Grid. In the "State of the Union" address in January 2011, the President set an ambitious goal: "By 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources." <ref type="bibr">42</ref> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 included $11 billion for Smart Grid technologies, transmission system expansion and upgrades, and other investments to modernize and enhance the electric transmission infrastructure to improve energy efficiency and reliability. <ref type="bibr">43</ref> These investments and associated actions to modernize the nation's electricity grid ultimately will result, for example, in more than 3,000 miles of new or modernized transmission lines <ref type="bibr">44</ref> and 15.5 million smart meters in American homes. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> In addition, the modernized grid will include almost 700 automated substations and more than 1,000 sensors (phasor measurement units) that will cover the entire electric grid, which will enable operators to detect minor disturbances and prevent them from cascading into local or regional power outages or blackouts. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> Progress toward realization of the Smart Grid will also contribute to accomplishing the President's goal, reiterated in his 2011 State of the Union address, to "become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015." 47 A DOE study found that the idle capacity of today's electric power grid could supply 70 percent of the energy needs of today's cars and light trucks without adding to generation or transmission capacity-if the vehicles charged during off-peak times. <ref type="bibr">48</ref> In June 2011, the White House released a new report by the Cabinet-level National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) entitled "A Policy Framework for the 21st Century Grid: Enabling Our Secure Energy Future." <ref type="bibr">49</ref> This report outlines four overarching goals the Administration will pursue in order to ensure that all Americans benefit from investments in the nation's electric infrastructure:</p><p>• Better alignment of economic incentives to boost development and deployment of Smart Grid technologies;</p><p>• Greater focus on standards and interoperability to enable greater innovation;</p><p>• Empowerment of consumers with enhanced information to save energy, ensure privacy, and shrink bills; and</p><p>• Improved cybersecurity and grid resilience.</p><p>This report calls on NIST and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to continue to catalyze the development and adoption of open standards to ensure that the following benefits are realized:</p><p>• Today's investments in the Smart Grid remain valuable in the future. Standards can ensure that Smart Grid investments made today will be compatible with advancing technology. Similarly, standards can ensure that Smart Grid devices are installed with proper consideration of the necessary security to enable and protect the grid of tomorrow;</p><p>• Innovation is catalyzed. Shared standards and protocols help reduce investment uncertainty by ensuring that new technologies can be used throughout the grid, lowering transaction costs and increasing compatibility. Standards also encourage entrepreneurs by enabling a significant market for their work;</p><p>• Consumer choice is supported. In the absence of Smart Grid interoperability standards, open standards developed in a consensus-based, collaborative, and balanced process can alleviate concerns that companies may attempt to "lock-in" consumers by using proprietary technologies that make their products (and, therefore, their consumers' assets) incompatible with other suppliers' products or services;</p><p>• Costs are reduced. Standards can reduce market fragmentation and help create economies of scale, providing consumers greater choice and lower costs;</p><p>• Best practices are highlighted as utilities face new and difficult choices. Standards can provide guidance to utilities as they face novel cybersecurity, interoperability, and privacy concerns; and</p><p>• Global markets are opened. Development of international Smart Grid interoperability standards can help to open global markets, create export opportunities for U.S. companies, and achieve greater economies of scale and vendor competition that will result in lower costs for utilities and ultimately consumers.</p><p>Over the long term, the integration of the power grid with the nation's transportation system has the potential to yield huge energy savings and other important benefits<ref type="foot" target="#foot_21">foot_21</ref> , which include:</p><p>• Displacement of about half of our nation's net oil imports;</p><p>• Reduction in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by about 25 percent; and</p><p>• Reductions in emissions of urban air pollutants of 40 percent to 90 percent.</p><p>Although the transition to the Smart Grid may unfold over many years, incremental progress along the way can yield significant benefits (see box below). In the United States, electric-power generation accounts for about 40 percent of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. <ref type="bibr">51</ref> The Electric Power Research Institute has estimated that, by 2030, Smart Grid-enabled (or facilitated) applications-from distribution voltage control to broader integration of intermittent renewable resources to electric transportation vehicles-could reduce the nation's carbon-dioxide emissions (60 to 211) million metric tons annually. <ref type="bibr">52</ref> The opportunities are many and the returns can be sizable. If the current power grid were 5 percent more efficient, the resultant energy savings would be equivalent to permanently eliminating the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from 53 million cars. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> In its National Assessment of Demand Response Potential, FERC has estimated the potential for peak electricity demand reductions to be equivalent to up to 20 percent of national peak demand-enough to eliminate the need to operate hundreds of backup power plants. <ref type="bibr">54</ref> The </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Smart Grid Standards 2.3.</head><p>The Smart Grid will span the globe, and the United States is not alone in its initiative to modernize the electric grid. A number of other countries have launched significant efforts to encourage the development of the Smart Grid in their own countries and regions.</p><p>As countries move forward with their individual initiatives, it is very important that Smart Grid efforts are coordinated and harmonized internationally. An essential element of this coordination will be the development of international standards.</p><p>International coordination will provide a double benefit: 57 <ref type="url" target="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/815-830_Welcome-Overview-E-Lightner.pdf">http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/815-830_Welcome-Overview-E-Lightner.pdf</ref> . 58 U.S. Department of Energy, "Secretary Chu Announces Efforts to Strengthen U.S. Electric Transmission Networks," December 18, 2009.

As a result, costs will be lower, and those savings will benefit utilities and consumers.</p><p>NIST is devoting considerable resources and attention to bilateral and multilateral engagement with other countries to cooperate in the development of international standards for the Smart Grid. Among the countries that have or will begin investing in substantial Smart Grid infrastructure are Canada, Mexico, Brazil, many of the member states of the EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and China.</p><p>In addition, NIST and the International Trade Administration (ITA) have partnered with the Department of Energy to establish the International Smart Grid Action Network (ISGAN), a multinational collaboration of 23 countries and the European Union.

In the broadest perspective, the architectural framework being developed by the Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC) of the SGIP provides an overarching perspective above other architectural efforts. These architectures will be evaluated against the conceptual reference model, the semantic framework, the standards and architecture evaluation criteria, and the conceptual business services.</p><p>Harmonization efforts are under way with (but are not limited to) the following groups:</p><p>• The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) P2030 has been developing a view of the Smart Grid organized into three major areas: physical, communications, and information. This logical architecture conforms to the NIST Conceptual Reference Model and provides a set of defined interfaces for the Smart Grid. An SGAC/P2030 harmonization activity was begun in April 2011. Collaboration with additional groups to harmonize architectures will begin as they are identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Attributes -Standards and Conformance 2.5.</head><p>The Smart Grid, unprecedented in its scope and breadth, will demand significant levels of cooperation to fully achieve the ultimate vision described in Section 2.1. Efforts directed toward enabling interoperability among the many diverse components of the evolving Smart Grid must address the following issues and considerations.</p><p>Standards are critical to enabling interoperable systems and components. Mature, robust standards are the foundation of mass markets for the millions of components that will have a role in the future Smart Grid. Standards enable innovation where thousands of companies may construct individual components. Standards also enable consistency in systems management and maintenance over the life cycles of components. Criteria for Smart Grid interoperability standards are discussed further in Chapter 4.</p><p>The evidence of the essential role of standards is growing. A Congressional Research Service report, for example, cited the ongoing deployment of smart meters as an area in need of widely accepted standards. The U.S. investment in smart meters is predicted to be at least $40 billion to 60 <ref type="url" target="http://www.nist.gov/smartgrid/upload/eu-us-smartgrids-white-paper.pdf">http://www.nist.gov/smartgrid/upload/eu-us-smartgrids-white-paper.pdf</ref>.</p><p>$50 billion over the next several years. <ref type="bibr">61</ref> Globally, one prediction forecasts installation of 100 million new smart meters over the next five years. <ref type="bibr">62</ref> Sound interoperability standards will ensure that sizable public and private sector technology investments are not stranded. Such standards enable diverse systems and their components to work together and to securely exchange meaningful, actionable information.</p><p>Clearly, there is a need for concerted action and accelerated efforts to speed the development of high-priority standards. But the standards development, prioritization, and harmonization process must be systematic, not ad hoc.</p><p>Moreover, while standards are necessary to achieve interoperability, they are not sufficient. A conformance testing and certification framework for Smart Grid equipment is also essential. The SGIP has developed an overall framework for conformance testing and certification and steps have been taken toward implementation. This topic is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Different Layers of Interoperability</head><p>Large, integrated, complex systems require different layers of interoperability, from a plug or wireless connection to compatible processes and procedures for participating in distributed business transactions. In developing the conceptual model described in the next chapter, the high-level categorization approach developed by GWAC was considered. <ref type="bibr">63</ref> Referred to as the "GWAC stack," the eight layers shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>-2 comprise a vertical cross-section of the degrees of interoperation necessary to enable various interactions and transactions on the Smart Grid. Very simple functionality-such as the physical equipment layer and software for encoding and transmitting data-might be confined to the lowest layers. Communication protocols and applications reside on higher levels with the top levels reserved for business functionality. As functions and capabilities increase in complexity and sophistication, more layers of the GWAC stack are required to interoperate to achieve the desired results. Each layer typically depends upon-and is enabled by-the layers below it.</p><p>The most important feature of the GWAC stack is that the layers define well-known interfaces: establishing interoperability at one layer can enable flexibility at other layers. The most obvious example of this is seen in the Internet: with a common Network Interoperability layer, the Basic Connectivity Layer can vary from Ethernet to WiFi to optical and microwave links, but the different networks can exchange information in the same common way. The GWAC stack is further discussed in Release 1.0 64 . 64 <ref type="url" target="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/upload/smartgrid_interoperability_final.pdf">http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/upload/smartgrid_interoperability_final.pdf</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual Architectural Framework Introduction 3.1.</head><p>The Smart Grid is a complex system of systems, serving the diverse needs of many stakeholders. Devices and systems developed independently by many different suppliers, operated by many different utilities, and used by millions of customers, must work together. Moreover these systems must work together not just across technical domains but across smart grid "enterprises" as well as the smart grid industry as a whole. Achieving interoperability in such a massively scaled, distributed system requires architectural guidance, which is provided by the "conceptual architectural framework" described in this chapter.</p><p>The architectural framework will be used for several important purposes:</p><p>• To provide stakeholders a common understanding of the elements that make up the Smart Grid and their relationships;</p><p>• To provide traceability between the functions and the goals of the smart grid as provided by key stakeholder communities</p><p>• To provide a series of high level and strategic views of the envisioned systems</p><p>• To provide a technical pathway to the integration of systems across domains, companies, and businesses; and</p><p>• To guide the various architectures, systems, subsystems, and supporting standards that make up the Smart Grid.</p><p>The architectural framework described in this chapter includes the following:</p><p>• Architectural Goals for the Smart Grid (Section 3.2);</p><p>• Conceptual Reference Model, which comprises the conceptual domain models and the combined reference model (Section 3.3);</p><p>• Models for Smart Grid Information Networks (Section 3.4);</p><p>• Smart Grid Interface to the Customer Domain (Section 3.6); and</p><p>• Conceptual Business Services (Section 3.7.4).</p><p>Other important, architecture-related topics discussed in this chapter include the following:</p><p>• Use Cases (Section 3.5);</p><p>• Standards Review by the Smart Grid Architecture Committee (Section 3.7.1);</p><p>• Legacy Integration and Legacy Migration (Section 3.7.2); and</p><p>• Common Understanding of Information (Section 3.7.3).</p><p>Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 were included in Framework 1.0 and have been updated here. Section 3.7 provides new material that summarizes work in progress by the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Architectural Goals for the Smart Grid 3.2.</head><p>Fundamental goals of architectures for the Smart Grid include: <ref type="bibr">65</ref> • Options -Architectures should support a broad range of technology options-both legacy and new. Architectures should be flexible enough to incorporate evolving technologies as well as to work with legacy applications and devices in a standard way, avoiding as much additional capital investment and/or customization as possible.</p><p>• Interoperability -Architectures must support interfacing with other systems. This includes the integration of interoperable third-party products into the management and cybersecurity infrastructures.</p><p>• Maintainability -Architectures should support the ability of systems to be safely, securely, and reliably maintained throughout their life cycle.</p><p>• Upgradeability -Architectures should support the ability of systems to be enhanced without difficulty and to remain operational during periods of partial system upgrades.</p><p>• Innovation -Architectures should enable and foster innovation. This includes the ability to accommodate innovation in regulations and policies; business processes and procedures; information processing; technical communications; and the integration of new and innovative energy systems.</p><p>• Scalability -Architectures should include architectural elements that are appropriate for the applications that reside within them. The architectures must support development of massively scaled, well-managed, and secure systems with life spans appropriate for the type of system, which range from 5 to 30 years.</p><p>• Legacy -Architectures should support legacy system integration and migration. (The key issue of dealing with legacy systems integration and migration is discussed in greater depth in Section 3.7.2.)</p><p>• Security -Architectures should support the capability to resist unwanted intrusion, both physical and cyber. This support must satisfy all security requirements of the system components. (This is covered in more detail in Chapter 6.).</p><p>• Flexibility -Architectures should allow an implementer to choose the type and order of implementation and to choose which parts of the architecture to implement without incurring penalties for selecting a different implementation.</p><p>• Governance -Architectures should promote a well-managed system of systems that will be enabled through consistent policies over its continuing design and operation for its entire life cycle.</p><p>• Affordability -Should enable multivendor procurement of interoperable Smart Grid equipment through the development of mature national and international markets. Architecture should fundamentally enable capital savings as well as life cycle savings through standards-based operations and maintenance.</p><p>Conceptual Reference Model 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Overview</head><p>The conceptual model presented in this chapter supports planning, requirements development, documentation, and organization of the diverse, expanding collection of interconnected networks and equipment that will compose the Smart Grid. For this purpose, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) adopted the approach of dividing the Smart Grid into seven domains, as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>-1 and shown graphically in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3-1</ref>.</p><p>Each domain-and its sub-domains-encompass Smart Grid actors and applications. Actors include devices, systems, programs, and stakeholders that make decisions and exchange information necessary for performing applications: smart meters, solar energy generators, and control systems are examples of devices and systems. Applications are tasks performed by one or more actors within a domain. For example, corresponding applications may be home automation; solar energy generation and energy storage; and energy management. These actors, applications, and requirements for communications that enable the functionality of the Smart Grid are described in use cases, which are summaries of the requirements that define Smart Grid functions. A use case is a story, told in structured and detailed steps, about how actors work together to define the requirements to achieve Smart Grid goals.</p><p>Chapter 10 (Appendix: Specific Domain Diagrams) describes the seven Smart Grid domains in more detail. It contains domain-specific diagrams intended to illustrate the type and scope of interactions within and across domains. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>.2 is a composite 'box" diagram, called the combined reference diagram, that combines attributes of the seven domain-specific diagrams. The end users of electricity. May also generate, store, and manage the use of energy. Traditionally, three customer types are discussed, each with its own domain: residential, commercial, and industrial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Markets</head><p>The operators and participants in electricity markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Service Provider</head><p>The organizations providing services to electrical customers and to utilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Operations</head><p>The managers of the movement of electricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Bulk Generation</head><p>The generators of electricity in bulk quantities. May also store energy for later distribution.</p><p>6 Transmission The carriers of bulk electricity over long distances. May also store and generate electricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Distribution</head><p>The distributors of electricity to and from customers. May also store and generate electricity.</p><p>In general, actors in the same domain have similar objectives. However, communications within the same domain may have different characteristics and may have to meet different requirements to achieve interoperability.</p><p>To enable Smart Grid functionality, the actors in a particular domain often interact with actors in other domains, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>.1. Moreover, particular domains may also contain components of other domains. For example, the 10 Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in North America have actors in both the Markets and Operations domains. Similarly, a distribution utility is not entirely contained within the Distribution domain-it is likely to contain actors in the Operations domain, such as a distribution management system, and in the Customer domain, such as meters. On the other hand, a vertically integrated utility may have actors in many domains.</p><p>Underlying the conceptual model is a legal and regulatory framework that enables the implementation and management of consistent policies and requirements that apply to various actors and applications and to their interactions. Regulations, adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) at the federal level and by public utility commissions at the state and local levels, govern many aspects of the Smart Grid. Such regulations are intended to ensure that electric rates are fair and reasonable and that security, reliability, safety, privacy, and other public policy requirements are met. <ref type="bibr">66</ref> The transition to the Smart Grid introduces new regulatory considerations, which may transcend jurisdictional boundaries and require increased coordination among federal, state, and local lawmakers and regulators. The conceptual model is intended to be a useful tool for regulators at all levels to assess how best to achieve public policy goals that, along with business objectives, motivate investments in modernizing the nation's electric power infrastructure and building a clean energy economy. Therefore, the conceptual model must be consistent with the legal and regulatory framework and support its evolution over time. Similarly, the standards and protocols identified in the framework must align with existing and emerging regulatory objectives and responsibilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Description of Conceptual Model</head><p>The conceptual model described here provides a high-level, overarching perspective of a few major relationships that are developing across the smart grid domains. It is not only a tool for identifying actors and possible communications paths in the Smart Grid, but also a useful way for identifying potential intra-and inter-domain interactions, as well as the potential applications and capabilities enabled by these interactions. The conceptual model represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-1 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-2 is intended to aid in analysis by providing a view of the types of interaction development that are at the core of developing architectures for the Smart Grid; it is not a design diagram that defines a solution and its implementation. Architecture documentation goes much deeper than what is illustrated here, but stops short of specific design and implementation detail.</p><p>In other words, the conceptual model is descriptive and not prescriptive. It is meant to foster understanding of Smart Grid operational intricacies but not meant to prescribe how a particular stakeholder will implement the Smart Grid.  Information Network: An information network is a collection, or aggregation, of interconnected computers, communication devices, and other information and communication technologies that exchange information and share resources. The Smart Grid consists of many different types of networks, not all of which are shown in the diagram. The networks include: the Enterprise Bus that connects control center applications to markets and generators, and with each other; Wide Area Networks that connect geographically distant sites; Field Area Networks that connect devices, such as Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) that control circuit breakers and transformers; and Premises Networks that include customer networks as well as utility networks within the Customer domain. These networks may be implemented using a combination of public (e.g., the Internet) and nonpublic networks. Both public and nonpublic networks will require implementation and maintenance of appropriate security and access control to support the Smart Grid. Examples of where communications may go through the public networks include: customers to third-party providers; bulk generators to grid operators; markets to grid operators; and third-party providers to utilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comms (Communications) Path:</head><p>The communications path shows the logical exchange of data between actors or between actors and networks. Secure communications are not explicitly shown in the figure and are addressed in more detail in Chapter 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models for Smart Grid Information Networks 3.4.</head><p>The combined reference diagram, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-2, shows many comunication paths between and within domains. These paths illustrate key information flows between applications that reside both within and between domains.</p><p>Currently, various functions are supported by independent and, often, dedicated networks. Examples range from enterprise data and business networks, typically built on the Internet Protocol (IP) family of network layer protocols, to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems utilizing specialized protocols. However, to fully realize the Smart Grid goals of vastly improving the control and management of power generation, transmission and distribution, and consumption, the current state of information network interconnectivity must be improved so that information can flow securely between the various actors in the Smart Grid. This information must be transmitted reliably over networks and must be interpreted consistently by applications. This requires that the meaning, or semantics, of transmitted information be welldefined and understood by all involved actors.</p><p>The following sections discuss some of the key outstanding issues that need to be addressed in order to support this vision of network interconnectivity across the Smart Grid.</p><p>Given that the Smart Grid will not only be a system of systems, but also a network of information networks, a thorough analysis of network and communications requirements for each sub-network is needed. This analysis should differentiate among the requirements pertinent to different Smart Grid applications, actors, and domains. One component of this analysis is to identify the security constraints and issues associated with each network interface and the impact level (low, moderate, or high) of a security compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This information is being compiled in collaboration with the Open Smart Grid/Smart Grid Network Task Force (OpenSG/SG-NET) and is being used by the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) in the selection and tailoring of security requirements. (See Chapter 6.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Information Network</head><p>The Smart Grid is a network of networks comprising many systems and subsystems. That is, many systems with various ownership and management boundaries interconnect to provide endto-end services between and among stakeholders as well as between and among intelligent devices.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-3 is an illustration of information networks where Smart Grid control and data messages are exchanged. Clouds are used to illustrate networks handling two-way communications between devices and applications. The devices and applications are represented by the boxes and belong to the seven different domains: Customer, Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Operations, Markets, and Service Provider, as identified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">-1.</formula><p>Example applications and devices in the Customer domain include smart meters, appliances, thermostats, energy storage, electric vehicles, and distributed generation. The interface to the Customer domain is further discussed in Section 3.6. Applications and devices in the Transmission or Distribution domain include phasor measurement units (PMUs) in a transmission line substation, substation controllers, distributed generation, and energy storage. Applications and devices in the Operations domain include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and computers or display systems at the operation center. While SCADA systems may have different communication characteristics, other computer applications in the Operations, Markets, and Service Provider domains are similar to those in Web and business information processing, and their networking function may not be distinguishable from normal information processing networks.</p><p>Each domain-labeled network (for example, "Transmission," "Generation," or "Distribution") is a unique distributed-computing environment and may have its own sub-networks to meet any domain-specific communication requirements.</p><p>The physical or logical links within and between these networks, and the links to the network end points, could utilize any appropriate communication technology either currently available or developed and standardized in the future.</p><p>Within each network, a hierarchical structure consisting of multiple network types may be implemented. Some of the network types that may be involved are Home Area Networks, Personal Area Networks, Wireless Access Networks, Local Area Networks, and Wide Area Networks. On the basis of Smart Grid functional requirements, the network should provide the capability to enable an application in a particular domain to communicate with an application in any other domain over the information network, with proper management control of all appropriate parameters (e.g., Who can be interconnected? Where? When? How?). Many communication network requirements need to be met including data management control, as well as network management such as configuration, monitoring, fault detection, fault isolation, addressability, service discovery, routing, quality of service, and security. Network security is a critical requirement to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Smart Grid information, control systems, and related information systems are properly protected. It may be necessary for regional networks, such as Network A and Network B in Figurer 3-3, to have interconnections. There is a need for international networks to connect between either the Nationwide Network or the regional networks, to meet the requirements that enable international power flows such as between Canada and the U.S.</p><p>Given the diversity of the networks, systems, and energy sectors involved, ensuring adequate security is critical so that a compromise in one system does not compromise security in other, interconnected systems. A security compromise could impact the availability and reliability of the entire electric grid. In addition, information within each specific system needs to be protected. Security includes the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all related systems. The CSWG is currently identifying and assessing the Smart Grid logical interfaces to determine the impact of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The objective is to select security requirements to mitigate the risk of cascading security breaches. This is further discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Security for Smart Grid Information Systems and Control System Networks</head><p>Because Smart Grid information and controls flow through many networks with various owners, it is critical to properly secure the information and controls, along with the respective networks. This means reducing the risk of malicious or accidental cybersecurity events while, at the same time, allowing access for the relevant stakeholders.</p><p>Security for the Smart Grid information and control networks must include requirements for:</p><p>• Security policies, procedures, and protocols to protect Smart Grid information and commands in transit or residing in devices and systems;</p><p>• Authentication policies, procedures, and protocols; and</p><p>• Security policies, procedures, protocols, and controls to protect infrastructure components and the interconnected networks.</p><p>An overview of the Smart Grid cybersecurity strategy is included in Chapter 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3.">Internet Protocol (IP) -Based Networks</head><p>Among Smart Grid stakeholders, there is a wide expectation that Internet Protocol (IP) -based networks will serve as a key element for the Smart Grid information networks. While IP may not address all Smart Grid communications requirements, there are a number of aspects that make it an important Smart Grid technology. Benefits of using IP-based networks include the maturity of a large number of IP standards, the availability of tools and applications that can be applied to Smart Grid environments, and the widespread use of IP technologies in both private and public networks. In addition, IP technologies serve as a bridge between applications and the underlying communication media. They allow applications to be developed independent of both the communication infrastructure and the various communication technologies to be used, whether they be wired or wireless.</p><p>Furthermore, IP-based networks enable bandwidth sharing among applications and provide increased reliability with dynamic-routing capabilities. For Smart Grid applications that have specific quality-of-service requirements (e.g., minimum access delay, maximum packet loss, or minimum bandwidth constraints), other technologies, such as Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), can be used for the provisioning of dedicated resources. By design, an IP-based network is easily scalable, so new Smart Grid devices, such as smart meters, smart home appliances, and data concentrators in neighborhoods, can be readily added.</p><p>As the scale of IP-based networks for Smart Grid expands, the numbers of devices connected to the network is expected to increase substantially, and consequently the number of addresses needed in the IP network to uniquely identify these devices will increase as well. The fact that the available pool of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses will be exhausted soon should be considered carefully. Even though an alternative addressing scheme in conjunction with translation/mapping into IP addresses might work, we encourage the use of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) for new systems to be developed and deployed. IPv6 was specifically developed to solve the address space issue and to provide enhancements for the IP network. <ref type="bibr">67</ref> For each set of Smart Grid requirements, an analysis will determine whether IP is appropriate and whether cybersecurity and desired performance characteristics can be ensured. For the correct operation of IP networks in Smart Grid environments, a suite of protocols must be identified and developed on the basis of standards defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force 68 (IETF). These standards are commonly referred to as Request for Comments (RFCs). The definition of the necessary suite of RFCs will be dictated by the networking requirements, which have yet to be fully determined for Smart Grid applications. Given the heterogeneity and the large number of devices and systems that will be interconnected within the Smart Grid, multiple IP protocol suites may be needed to satisfy a wide range of network requirements. In addition, protocols and guidelines must be developed for the initiation of Smart Grid applications, the establishment and management of Smart Grid connections, and the packetization of Smart Grid application-specific data traffic over IP.</p><p>Working with SGIP's Priority Action Plan on IP (PAP01), the IETF has produced a new specification on Smart Grid, RFC 6272 Internet Protocols for the Smart Grid. <ref type="bibr">69</ref> This document provides Smart Grid designers with guidance on how to use the the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) in the Smart Grid. It provides an overview of the IPS and the key infrastructure protocols that are critical in integrating Smart Grid devices into an IP-based infrastructure; it also provides an example of how one might structure a network for advanced metering applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.4.">Smart Grid and Public Internet: Security Concerns</head><p>One of the advantages of the Smart Grid is the ability to efficiently manage energy loads and the consumption of energy within many domains. Many of the Smart Grid use cases describe how utilities can work with customers to control and manage home energy consumption. To enable this functionality, information may flow back and forth between the utility and the customer. The presence of both Smart Grid networks and public Internet connections at the customer site (e.g., within the home) may introduce security concerns that must be addressed. With the customer potentially having access to utility-managed information or information from a third party, safeguards are required to prevent access to the utility control systems that manage power grid operations. These security risks are being assessed by the CSWG as described in Chapter 6.</p><p>67 NIST Information Technology Laboratory IPv6 Guide Provides Path to Secure Deployment of Next-Generation Internet Protocol. <ref type="url" target="http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ipv6_010511.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ipv6_010511.cfm</ref>. <ref type="bibr">68</ref> The Internet Engineering Task Force. <ref type="url" target="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</ref>.</p><p>69 <ref type="url" target="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6272.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6272.txt</ref> and <ref type="url" target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6272">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6272</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.5.">Standards Technologies for Smart Grid Communication Infrastructure</head><p>There are a number of mature technologies available to support Smart Grid information networks. Network requirements determined to be necessary to support Smart Grid applications will guide the choice of the communication technologies to be used. Standards relevant to physical network infrastructure are too numerous to list and include standards developed by many standards development organizations (SDOs), including the SDOs accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), as well as international SDOs, such as the International Telecommunication Union's Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), the ITU's Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE-SA). These standards cover transmission media such as optical fiber, coaxial cable, copper twisted pair, power lines, wireless, cellular, and satellite.</p><p>The selection of a specific technology for use in the Smart Grid depends on the requirements of applications and the environment in which the network is to operate. To assist Smart Grid designers in developing appropriate network architecture, the Priority Action Plan on Wireless Communications (PAP02), working with the OpenSG, has compiled a Smart Grid application communication requirements document. <ref type="bibr">70</ref> In addition, PAP02 has provided methodologies and tools 71 for assessing the applicability of specific technologies. Even though the work was done in the context of wireless technologies, the outputs are equally applicable to wire line technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use Cases 3.5.</head><p>The conceptual reference model provides a useful tool for constructing use cases. A use case describes the interaction between a Smart Grid actor and a system when the actor is using the system to accomplish a specified goal. Use cases can be classified as "black box" or "white box." A black-box use case describes the actor/system interaction and the functional requirements to achieve the goal, but it leaves the details of the inner workings of the system to the implementer. Black-box use cases are "descriptive." In contrast, white-box use cases describe the internal details of the system, in addition to the interaction and associated requirements. White-box use cases are "prescriptive," because they do not allow the implementer to change the internal system design. For this interoperability standards framework and roadmap, the focus is on the black-box use cases that describe how systems within the Smart Grid interact. Because white-box use cases, which describe the details of a particular solution, are prescriptive, they are not covered by the framework. The focus on black-box use cases will allow maximum innovation in Smart Grid applications while ensuring their ready deployment and interoperability within the Smart Grid as it evolves.</p><p>Individually and collectively, these use cases are helpful when scoping out interoperability requirements for specific areas of functionality-such as on-premises energy management or predictive maintenance for grid equipment. When viewed from a variety of stakeholder perspectives and application domains, combining the actors and interactions from multiple use cases permits the Smart Grid to be rendered as a collection of transactional relationships, within and across domains, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3-2</ref>.</p><p>Many Smart Grid intra-and inter-domain use cases have already been developed, and the number will grow substantially. The scope of the body of existing use cases also covers crosscutting requirements, including cybersecurity, network management, data management, and application integration, as described in the GridWise Architecture Council Interoperability Context-Setting Framework.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_30">foot_30</ref> See Section 2.5 for further discussion of the layers of interoperability and "GWAC stack" discussed in this document.</p><p>Developing black-box use cases and interface requirements was a major activity at the second NIST Smart Grid interoperability standards public workshop (May 19-20, 2009), attended by more than 600 people. This activity focused on six Smart Grid functionalities: wide-area situational awareness, demand response, energy storage, electric transportation, advanced metering infrastructure, and distribution grid management. The workshop utilized the Intelligrid SM<ref type="foot" target="#foot_31">foot_31</ref> approach for developing requirements from relevant use cases to identify the interoperability standards needed for the Smart Grid. More recently, a series of use case workshops were begun by the IEC Strategic Group 3 (SG-3) <ref type="bibr">74</ref> to continue the development of use cases to further the identification of requirements for the Smart Grid, and to further the standardization of use cases.</p><p>Detailed use cases can be found on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site. <ref type="bibr">75</ref> The use cases include the CSWG's use cases in priority and supplemental areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smart Grid Interface to the Customer Domain 3.6.</head><p>The interface between the Smart Grid and the Customer domain is of special importance as the most visible part of this domain.</p><p>The conceptual reference model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-2) depicts two distinct elements that together provide the interface to the Customer Domain:</p><p>• The Meter, and</p><p>• The Energy Services Interface (ESI), which serves as the gateway to the Customer Premises Network.</p><p>Through these interfaces, electricity usage is measured, recorded, and communicated; service provisioning and maintenance functions are performed (such as remote connection and disconnection of service); and pricing and demand response signaling occurs.</p><p>New and innovative energy-related services, which we may not even imagine today, will be developed and may require additional data streams between the Smart Grid and the Customer domain. Extensibility and flexibility are important considerations. The interface must be interoperable with a wide variety of energy-using devices and controllers, such as thermostats, water heaters, appliances, consumer electronics, and energy management systems. The diversity of communications technologies and standards used by devices in the Customer domain presents a significant interoperability challenge. In addition, ensuring cybersecurity is a critical consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1.">Distinction between the Meter and Energy Services Interface (ESI)</head><p>The meter and an ESI have very different characteristics and functions. The logical separation of the meter and the ESI is a very important, forward-looking aspect of the reference model.</p><p>The meter's essential functions are to measure, record, and communicate energy usage; communicate information for outage management; and enable automated provisioning and maintenance functions, such as connection or disconnection of service. Additional functions that may be added are measuring and recording meter events that assist with power quality management, and capture of meter events that notify the utility of possible damage or unauthorized handling of the meter. Meters also measure the flow of power into the grid from distributed generation or storage resources located at the customers' premises. Meters have historically been designed with a service life measured in decades, and the cost recovery period set by regulators is at least a decade. Thus, once a meter is installed, it remains in place there for a very long time as the electrical interface to the electric utility. The meter may be owned by the utility and is at the interface between the Distribution and Customer domains. In the conceptual reference model, it is shown in the Customer domain because that is where it physically resides.</p><p>An ESI serves as the information management gateway through which the Customer domain interacts with energy service providers. The service provider may be an electric utility, but that is not necessarily the case. In some states, such as Texas, the market has been restructured so that the service provider may be a company entirely separate from the electric utility. Customers have a choice of competing service providers. Some third-party service providers offer demand response aggregation, energy management services, and other such offerings. A telephone company, cable company, or other nontraditional provider might wish to offer their customers energy management services. The standards associated with an ESI need to be flexible and extensible to allow for innovation in market structures and services. Basic functions of the ESI include demand response signaling (e.g., communicating price information or critical peak period signals), and provide customer energy usage information to residential energy management systems or in-home displays. However, the possibilities for more advanced services are virtually limitless, so ideally standards associated with an ESI should facilitate, rather than impede, innovation. An ESI interfaces with the service provider, which, as discussed above, may or may not be the same company as the electric utility. In addition, there are other designs that are possible. Multiple ESIs may exist at a customer's premises.</p><p>While an ESI and meter are logically viewed as separate devices, this does not preclude the possibility for manufacturers to implement the meter and ESI within one physical device, provided that the flexibility and extensibility to support the Smart Grid vision can be achieved. Currently, some smart meters include the functionality of an ESI. Looking forward, logical separation of the two functions, even if physically integrated, is essential to allow for innovation in energy services enabled by the Smart Grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2.">The ESI and the Home Area Network</head><p>Many homes already have one or more data networks that interconnect computers or consumer electronic devices. However, this is not universally the case. Furthermore, even in homes that have data networks, consumers who lack the expertise may not wish to spend time or money configuring an appliance, such as a clothes dryer, to communicate over their home network. It should be possible for consumers to obtain the energy-saving benefits of Smart Grid-enabled appliances without requiring that they have a home area network or expertise in configuring data networks. Installation of products on the network must be extremely simple, assuming no previous networking experience. Ideally, a consumer would purchase, for example, a Smart Grid-enabled clothes dryer, plug it in, and be able to participate in a demand response application. The goal is for a smart appliance to operate solely on the basis of electricity price information and other demand response signals received from the Smart Grid. With the wide variation in utility implementation including communication standards, business practices, security concerns and rate structures, a "user-friendly" approach will take time to reach a standardized solution. To avoid undue expense and complexity, the ESI should be able to communicate with Smart Grid-enabled appliances either with or without a separate data network in the home with appropriate security controls, and such communication should require minimal configuration by the consumer.</p><p>Another issue that must be addressed is the need for manufacturers of appliances and consumer electronics goods to cost-effectively mass-produce products that will be interoperable with the Smart Grid anywhere in the country. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provides guidance on this issue. Section 1305 of EISA requires that the Smart Grid interoperability framework be designed to "consider the use of voluntary uniform standards for certain classes of mass-produced electric appliances and equipment for homes and businesses that enable customers, at their election and consistent with applicable State and Federal laws, and are manufactured with the ability to respond to electric grid emergencies and demand response signals." EISA advises that "such voluntary standards should incorporate appropriate manufacturer lead time."</p><p>There are a large number of physical data communication interfaces-wired, wireless, and power line carrier (PLC)-presently available for establishing connectivity with residential devices, and there will be more in the future. Mass-produced appliances and consumer electronics differ widely in terms of their expected service life and whether or not they are prone to regional relocation as consumers move. Makers of these devices may choose to embed one or more communication technologies in their products. The ESI could support a defined subset of widely used standard data communication protocols chosen from among those discussed in and listed in Chapter 4. Alternatively, the manufacturer may choose to employ a modular approach that would allow consumers to plug-in communication devices of their choosing. Work regarding standardization of a modular interface is currently underway in the Home-to-Grid (H2G) DEWG.</p><p>Many consumers and businesses are located in multi-unit buildings. Any data communication interfaces supported by the ESI and residential devices should be capable of coexisting with other data communications technologies that may be used in the customer premises without interfering with each other. The use of the Internet Protocol suite as the network-and transportlayer protocols for the ESI may provide a cost-effective solution to achieve interoperability between the ESI and appliances and other energy-using devices in the home. Work regarding the ESI standards is currently under way in the Industry-to-Grid (I2G) and Building-to-Grid (B2G) Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ongoing Work of the Smart Grid Architecture Committee 3.7. (SGAC)</head><p>The preceding sections of this chapter, Sections 3.2 -3.6, provide updated versions of architecture-related material included in Framework 1.0. Since the publication of that earlier document, the SGAC has identified additional issues requiring attention. For the newly identified issues, SGAC subgroups, called Working Parties, have been established, some deliverables have been published, and much work is in process. The subsections below-and the collaborative Web pages listed here as references-provide a snapshot of the current status of SGAC activities as of July 2011.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.1.">Standards Review by the SGAC</head><p>As part of the overall NIST effort to identify standards and protocols that ensure Smart Grid interoperability, it is important to evaluate and review the architectural elements of each proposed standard. The SGIP's formal process for evaluating standards and adding them to the Catalog of Standards (see Section 4.2 for more details) includes a review by the SGAC.</p><p>To date, the SGAC has produced detailed reports that contain analyses and recommendations for improvements in the following standards: • SAE J2847/1: Communication between Plug-in Vehicles and the Utility Grid;</p><p>• SAE J2836/1: Use Cases for Communication between Plug-in Vehicles and the Utility Grid; and</p><p>• NISTIR Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7761: Guidelines for Assessing Wireless Standards for Smart Grid Applications.</p><p>The SGAC will continue to assess standards for review. To improve the evaluation process, the SGAC is developing a standards review checklist. <ref type="bibr">76</ref> The SGAC has also formed teams to review the standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.2.">Legacy Devices and Systems</head><p>The integration of existing or "legacy" devices or systems is critical to the development of systems for the Smart Grid. Because Smart Grid goals include both innovation and upgradeability, the Smart Grid architectural framework must address the existence of legacy aspects as the Smart Grid systems evolve.</p><p>Legacy devices and systems are those that were designed and deployed in the past. They have aspects (including devices, systems, protocols, syntax, and semantics) that exist due to past design decisions, and these aspects may be inconsistent with the current architectural requirements of the Smart Grid and may not include the latest Smart Grid innovations. Legacy aspects can nevertheless be integrated, by implementing an intervening layer (an "adapter") that provides conformance.</p><p>The decision of whether to implement adapters to integrate legacy devices or systems should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes adapters are a good solution, and they can satisfy functional and performance requirements and may increase system flexibility and support technology evolution. Alternatively, adapters may limit functionality or performance. The implementation of adapters may result in a lower initial cost but may also result in a higher maintenance cost and/or eventual replacement cost when they are retired. When considering legacy integration, a business case needs to include an evaluation of life cycle costs and benefits.</p><p>The requirements established for legacy integration should clearly specify the degree of conformance needed (e.g., minimum or full conformance). Every decision should be considered for its impact on the overall system. For example, a security issue in one system might have an undesired effect on another system even though the systems are only indirectly related.</p><p>Three key goals of legacy integration and migration are:</p><p>• New systems should be designed so that present or legacy aspects do not unnecessarily limit future system evolution.</p><p>• A reasonable time frame for adaptation and migration of legacy systems must be planned to ensure legacy investments are not prematurely stranded.</p><p>• Legacy systems should be integrated in a way that ensures that security and other essential performance and functional requirements are met.</p><p>The SGAC Heterogeneity Working Party is developing evaluation criteria and guidance for the integration of legacy systems, and the ongoing work is available on the SGAC Heterogeneity Working Party collaborative Web page.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_35">foot_35</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.3.">Common Understanding of Information</head><p>The Smart Grid requires a high degree of communication and interaction among many diverse systems owned by stakeholders who in some cases have not previously worked together.</p><p>These systems typically have overlapping information requirements, but they may describe that information in different terms. A descriptive semantic model shows the data types and relationships between data types within a system. Usually, redesigning the applications to use the same semantic model (a model of the data types and relationships used in a system) internally is not a practical answer. The information expressed using one party's terminology (or model) must be transformed into the other party's terms to achieve integration.</p><p>The most straightforward way to implement any one transformation is to custom-build bilateral transformation code between two systems, often including tables of correspondence between the object instance identification used by each party. However, this approach is impractical when large numbers of systems are involved, which is the case with the Smart Grid. If there are "n" systems, then the number of transformations needed is on the order of n 2 . This means that the software maintenance and expansion costs to meet new business needs may become prohibitive as the number of systems becomes large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Canonical Data Models (CDMs)</head><p>To address the problem of scaling to large numbers of systems that use different semantic models, the Smart Grid requires a canonical data model (a single semantic model that a set of semantic models can be mapped into) to reduce the number of mappings from order n 2 to n+1.</p><p>There are two basic parts to the concept of a canonical data model.</p><p>When CDMs are used, exchanges between applications are organized as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3-4. Exchange between Two Applications Governed by a Canonical Data Model (CDM)</head><p>In this picture, the producer application (App) has the obligation to transform its output to the canonical form, and then the receiver has the obligation to transform from the canonical form into the receiver form. Where multiparty exchanges exist, all parties transform only to the canonical form and never need to know the internal details of any other application. And, the canonical form of the individual exchange is derived from an overarching CDM that would also cover other related exchanges. Using this approach, a maximum of n+1 transformations is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SGAC Smart Grid Semantic Framework</head><p>The Smart Grid is heavily dependent on the consistency of semantic models developed and maintained by SDOs to support the various systems of the Smart Grid. There is substantial benefit to promoting coordination and consistency of relevant semantic models within and across domains. The SGAC Semantic Working Party was established to begin to provide this desired coordination, and initial work has set the stage for future engagement of relevant stakeholders and SDOs in this effort. Planned deliverables, including the following, will be posted to the working party's collaborative Web page 78 as they are produced:</p><p>• Definitions of semantic concepts and methodologies for Smart Grid;</p><p>• Semantic harmonization scenarios for use by Smart Grid standards development groups. These scenarios will spell out how the framework can be used to integrate (in the general sense) two or more standards;</p><p>• Requirements to guide SDOs in the development and coordination of CDMs;</p><p>• A "map" showing the overall relationships among domain industry standard CDMs, and showing which standard exchanges belong to which domains;</p><p>• Documentation describing where exchanges go across domain boundaries and how harmonization between the domains is established;</p><p>• Identification of semantic methodologies, procedures, and design principles, along with identified toolsets; and</p><p>• A library of common semantic building blocks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guiding Principles Used for Identifying Interoperability 4.1. Standards</head><p>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) assigns the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the responsibility to coordinate the development of an interoperability framework including model standards and protocols. The identification of the standards and protocol documents that support interoperability of the Smart Grid is therefore a key element of the framework.</p><p>Two lists are presented in this chapter:</p><p>• The first, The lists of standards in this release of the NIST Framework document include a number of updates to those presented in Release 1.0. The changes are as follows:</p><p>• For Release 2.0, standards added to the list of NIST-identified standards, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-1, have been reviewed through the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS) process, recommended by the SGIP Governing Board (SGIP GB), and approved by the SGIP plenary. This process will continue as it is intended that all of the standards identified in • Several standards that did not exist at the time Release 1.0 was completed in January 2010 have been added to the tables. In some cases, the added standards are closely related to standards already included on the lists. Among those added to the relevant intellectual property owners have agreed to make that intellectual property available on a non-discriminatory, royalty-free, or reasonable-royalty basis to all interested parties. As defined in the OMB document, voluntary consensus standards bodies are "domestic or international organizations which plan, develop, establish, or coordinate voluntary consensus standards using agreed-upon procedures," 84 and have the following attributes: 1) openness, 2) balance of interest, 3) due process, 4) a process for appeals, and 5) consensus.</p><p>Consensus is defined as general agreement, but not necessarily unanimity. Consensus includes a process for attempting to resolve objections by interested parties. The process includes the following attributes:</p><p>• All comments are considered fairly;</p><p>• Each objector is advised of the disposition of his or her objection(s) and the reasons why; and</p><p>• The consensus body members are given an opportunity to change their votes after reviewing the comments.</p><p>As a general rule, it is NIST's position that Smart Grid interoperability standards should be developed in processes that are open, transparent, balanced, and have due process, consistent with the decision of the World Trade Organization's Technical Barriers to Trade Committee Principles for the Development of International Standards. <ref type="bibr">85</ref> That is, standards should be "developed and maintained through a collaborative, consensus-driven process that is open to participation by all relevant and materially affected parties and not dominated or under the control of a single organization or group of organizations, and readily and reasonably available to all for Smart Grid applications." <ref type="bibr">86</ref> In addition, Smart Grid interoperability standards should be developed and implemented internationally, wherever practical.</p><p>Because of the massive investment and accelerated time line for deployment of Smart Grid devices and systems, along with the consequent accelerated timetable for standards development and harmonization, NIST did not limit the lists of both identified and candidate standards to SDO-developed voluntary consensus standards. Rather, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-1 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-2 also include specifications, requirements, and guidelines developed by other SSOs. This was done to ensure that the interoperability framework would be established as quickly as possible to support current and imminent deployments of Smart Grid equipment. The SSO documents were developed by user groups, industry alliances, consortia, and other organizations. However, it is envisioned that these specifications and other documents will ultimately be used for development of standards by SDOs.</p><p>In making the selections of SSO documents listed in this section, NIST attempted to ensure that documents were consistent with the guiding principles, including that they be open and <ref type="bibr">84</ref> Ibid. <ref type="bibr">85</ref>  accessible. This does not mean that all of the standards and specifications are available for free, or that access can be gained to them without joining an organization (including those organizations requiring a fee). It does mean, however, that they will be made available under fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, which may include monetary compensation. To facilitate the development of the Smart Grid and the interoperability framework, NIST is working with SSOs to find ways to make the interoperability documents more accessible so that cost and other factors that may be a barrier to some stakeholders are made less burdensome. In 2010, NIST and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) coordinated to make documentary standards available to SGIP working groups and other stakeholders for a limited time to support working group and PAP assignments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guiding Principles for Identifying Standards for Implementation</head><p>For Release 2.0, a standard, specification, or guideline is evaluated on whether it:</p><p>• Is well-established and widely acknowledged as important to the Smart Grid.</p><p>• Is an open, stable, and mature industry-level standard developed in a consensus process from a standards development organization (SDO). • Enables the transition of the legacy power grid to the Smart Grid.</p><p>• Has, or is expected to have, significant implementations, adoption, and use.</p><p>• Is supported by an SDO or standards-or specification-setting organization (SSO) such as a users group to ensure that it is regularly revised and improved to meet changing requirements and that there is a strategy for continued relevance. • Is developed and adopted internationally, wherever practical.</p><p>• Is integrated and harmonized, or there is a plan to integrate and harmonize it with complementing standards across the utility enterprise through the use of an industry architecture that documents key points of interoperability and interfaces. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the Standards Identification Process 4.2.</head><p>The process used to establish the lists presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-1 of Section 4.3 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-2 of Section 4.4 in the initial (Release 1.0) and current (Release 2.0) versions of this document is described below. During the first phase of the NIST three-phase plan for Smart Grid interoperability, NIST's approach to accelerate the development of standards was to 1) identify existing standards that could be immediately applied to meet Smart Grid needs, or were expected to be available in the near future, and 2) identify gaps and establish priorities and action plans to develop additional needed standards to fill these gaps.</p><p>After the publication of the NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 1.0, and the establishment of the SGIP, NIST has transitioned the standard identification process so that it now works through various SGIP venues and activities. These venues include the many SGIP committees, SGIP working groups, PAPs, and numerous face-toface meetings in conjunction with many industry conferences relevant to the Smart Grid, such as Connectivity Week (<ref type="url" target="http://www.connectivityweek.com/">http://www.connectivityweek.com/</ref>), Grid Interop (<ref type="url" target="http://www.gridinterop.com/">http://www.gridinterop.com/</ref>), North American Synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) working group meetings (<ref type="url" target="http://www.naspi.org/">http://www.naspi.org/</ref>), and IEEE Conferences and Committee meetings (<ref type="url" target="http://www.ieee.org/index.html">http://www.ieee.org/index.html</ref>).

While loose coupling is desirable for general applications, tight coupling often will be required for critical infrastructure controls. committees, working groups, and PAPs can be found in Chapter 5, and detailed information about them and their activities can be found on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site. <ref type="bibr">87</ref> Priority Action Plans (PAPs) are established by the SGIP when there is a need for interoperability coordination on resolving urgent standards issues. The PAPs are executed within the scope of the SSOs that assume responsibility for the tasks that implement the plans. The role of the SGIP is to facilitate this process, ensure that all PAP materials are publicly available to the extent possible as they are developed on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site, and provide guidance as needed when significant differences among the participants in the PAP occur, or there is uncertainty about the PAP goals. <ref type="bibr">88</ref> Once the issues are resolved, the standard resulting from the PAP and actions of the participating SSOs continues through the SGIP review and approval process and ultimately is listed in the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS) <ref type="bibr">89</ref> . The CoS is discussed in greater detail in Section 5.3, where the purpose and scope, as well as the process and procedures for its management are described.</p><p>Note that the SGIP CoS is anticipated to be a key but not an exclusive source of input to the NIST process for coordinating the development of a framework of protocols and model standards for the Smart Grid under its EISA responsibilities.</p><p>The CoS is a compendium of standards and practices considered to be relevant for the development and deployment of a robust and interoperable Smart Grid. The CoS may contain multiple entries that may accomplish the same goals and are functionally equivalent; similarly, a single CoS entry may contain optional elements that need not be included in all implementations. In general, compliance with a standard does not guarantee interoperability due to the reasons given above. Though standards facilitate interoperability, they rarely, if ever, cover all levels of agreement and configuration required in practice. As a part of its work program, the SGIP is defining a testing and certification program that may be applied to the equipment, devices, and systems built to the standards listed in the CoS and that, if applied, will substantiate that implementations designed to the respective standards not only have compliance with the standards, but are also interoperable with one another. The CoS entry indicates where test profiles are defined and testing organizations identified for a particular standard. The SGIP finalized the process for adding standards to the CoS in May, 2011. The process 90 includes review by the Standards Subgroup of the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) to determine if the standards have adequately addressed cybersecurity requirements, which are defined in the NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7628, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cyber Security. <ref type="bibr">91</ref> The SGIP Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC) also performs a review against its requirements, and the Governing Board votes to recommend the standard to the SGIP plenary, which then votes on whether to approve the standard for the CoS. Cybersecurity and architecture reviews will be applied to all of the other standards identified in the tables below, as well as those identified in future NIST and SGIP activities. Results of these reviews will be made publicly available on the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) and Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC) Web sites. <ref type="bibr">92</ref> Standards organizations and prospective users of the reviewed specifications can use this information to address identified gaps or other issues. The CSWG has assigned liaisons to other working groups, PAPs, Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs), and SDOs to participate in and support the cybersecurity review of their activities when needed. Similarly, the SGAC has also assigned liaisons to these groups.</p></div>

As discussed further in Chapter 7, experience gained with devices designed to meet the requirements of the standards from interoperability testing and certification activities managed by Interoperability Testing and Certification Authorities (ITCAs) will also influence the changes to these standards. Many of the necessary modifications to these standards and related specifications will be driven by the SGIP's PAPs. In addition, the CSWG and the SGAC, whose ongoing efforts are described in more detail in Chapters 6 and 3, respectively, are also addressing some of these needed modifications.

From its inception, the SGIP has incorporated the cybersecurity and architectural reviews into the standard-assessment and PAP-activity-assessment processes. Moving forward, standard conformance and interoperability testing results will also provide feedback to the standard identification process.</p><p>With the publication of NISTIR 7628, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cyber Security, all existing and new standards identified as supporting Smart Grid interoperability are required to undergo a thorough cybersecurity review as part of the current and future standard identification process. Results of these reviews are made publicly available on the CSWG Web site -over 20 standards have already been reviewed. <ref type="bibr">96</ref> Standards organizations and prospective users of the reviewed specifications can identify gaps and other issues with this information.</p><p>Existing and new standards are also required to undergo a thorough architecture review. Mapping identified standards and the PAP activities to the conceptual architecture and the GWAC stacks helps to reveal gaps and areas that may need future standards development and/or priority actions. The standards identified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-1 and those emerging from PAP activities are undergoing architectural reviews conducted by the SGAC. The checklist and review process will continue to evolve. Upon adoption of the interoperability standard testing and certification framework developed by the SGTCC (see Chapter 7), NIST expects that feedback from the standard conformance and interoperability test results will become an important part of the future standard identification process. For example, the deficiencies and gaps of a standard, identified through the interoperability testing and certification process, could determine whether a candidate standard needs further review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS)</head><p>As described in Section 4.2 and Section 5.3, the SGIP has established the process for adopting and adding standards to the SGIP CoS. As standards are reviewed and added to the CoS, NIST will consider adding these standards to Table 4-1. As new candidate standards emerge through the ongoing work of the SGIP and its various working groups, these new standards will be considered for addition to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">4</ref>-2, after NIST has applied an additional analysis based on the guiding principles given in Section 4.1 to the standards present in the SGIP CoS.</p><p>96 <ref type="url" target="http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/NISTStandardsSummaries">http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/NISTStandardsSummaries</ref>.</p><p>As part of its Charter objectives, the SGIP produces and maintains a Catalog of Standards (CoS). This section describes the purpose and scope of the CoS, as well as the process and procedures for the management of the SGIP CoS. Procedures are described for the management of the life cycle of a standard's entry into the CoS, from its proposed inclusion, to its approval for inclusion, its periodic review for relevance, and its possible deprecation and removal from the Catalog. Note that the SGIP CoS is anticipated to provide a key, but not exclusive, source of input to the NIST process for coordinating the development of a framework of protocols and model standards for the Smart Grid under its Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) responsibilities.</p><p>The CoS is a compendium of standards and practices considered to be relevant for the development and deployment of a robust and interoperable Smart Grid. The CoS may contain multiple entries that may accomplish the same goals and are functionally equivalent; similarly, a single CoS entry may contain optional elements that need not be included in all implementations. In general, compliance with a standard does not guarantee interoperability due to the reasons given above. Though standards facilitate interoperability, they rarely, if ever, cover all levels of agreement and configuration required in practice. As a part of its work program, the SGIP is defining a testing and certification program that may be applied to the equipment, devices, and systems built to the standards listed in the CoS and that, if applied, will substantiate that implementations designed to the respective standards not only have compliance with the standards, but are also interoperable with one another. The CoS entry will indicate when test profiles have been defined and testing organizations identified for a particular standard; this will be indicated in the Catalog entry.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview: Smart Grid Interoperability Panel 5.1.</head><p>Created in November 2009, the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) provides a forum to support stakeholder participation and representation in order to further the development and evolution of Smart Grid interoperability standards. The SGIP<ref type="foot" target="#foot_41">foot_41</ref> , which consists of organizations spread among 22 categories of Smart Grid stakeholders, has three primary functions:</p><p>• To oversee activities intended to expedite the development of interoperability and cybersecurity specifications by standards-setting organizations (SSOs);</p><p>• To provide technical guidance to facilitate the development of standards for a secure, interoperable Smart Grid; and</p><p>• To specify testing and certification requirements necessary to assess the interoperability of Smart Grid-related equipment.</p><p>The SGIP, a public-private partnership, is a membership-based organization that serves as a forum to coordinate the development of standards and specifications by many SSOs. The SGIP does not write standards, but rather it provides an open process for stakeholders to interact with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the ongoing coordination, acceleration, and harmonization of new and emerging standards for the Smart Grid. It also reviews use cases, identifies requirements and architectural reference models, coordinates and accelerates Smart Grid testing and certification, and proposes action plans for achieving these objectives. As of January, 2012, the SGIP includes over 740 member organizations and over 1,900 member representatives in 22 Smart Grid stakeholder categories; 29 of these member representatives are from Canada, with the largest foreign membership, and 58 more are from other countries, including China. These member organizations and member representatives make up the SGIP Plenary, which meets several times each year, in both face-to-face and virtual meetings. The Plenary Chair is selected by a majority vote of the SGIP Governing Board (SGIPGB). The Plenary Vice Chair and Secretary are elected by a majority vote of the Stakeholders that compose the SGIP. The Chair, Vice Chair, and Secretary are all two-year terms, and all positions are eligible for a single re-election.</p><p>The SGIP is guided by a Governing Board, elected by the participating member organizations. The Governing Board approves work programs for the SGIP to efficiently carry out its work, prioritizes objectives, and arranges for the necessary resources. The Governing Board's responsibilities include facilitating a dialogue with SDOs and other Smart Grid-related organizations including utilities, equipment manufacturers, consumers, government agencies, and regulators as well as others, to ensure that the action plans can be implemented. The members comprise representatives from the 22 stakeholder groups plus 3 at-large members and maintain a broad perspective of the NIST Interoperability Framework and support NIST.</p><p>As established in the Bylaws, the SGIP has two permanent committees (see Section 5.2 below).</p><p>The SGIP may also form additional permanent working groups (see Section 5.2 below) and ad hoc working groups. All SGIP outputs are delivered to the public through the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Wiki and the Interoperability Knowledge Base (IKB) web site (see Section 5.7 below). The SGIP, its Governing Board, and its working groups are open organizations dedicated to balancing the needs of a variety of Smart Grid-related organizations. Any organization may become a member of the SGIP. Members are required to declare an affiliation with an identified stakeholder category; 22 stakeholder categories have thus far been identified by NIST and are listed on the Smart Grid Collaboration website. <ref type="bibr">98</ref> Member organizations may contribute multiple member representatives, but only one Voting Member Representative. Participating members must regularly take part in order to vote on the work products of the SGIP. The SGIP Governing Board includes one member representing each stakeholder category, the chairs of the two standing committees, several "members at large," and several ex officio members representing other stakeholders (e.g., key government agencies). Terms of SGIP Governing Board members are staggered to ensure regular turnover and continuity.</p><p>The SGIP does not intend to duplicate work being done in any other organization, but intends to fill a role that is not sufficiently addressed in other current Smart Grid forums-specifically advancing the goals of NIST in its EISA 2007 mission. As such, the SGIP focuses on two principal areas where value can be added:</p><p>• Analysis of cross-functional area applications. Such applications often require coordination between one or more technologies, and this coordination introduces issues and requirements beyond the original scope of the technology or technologies.</p><p>• Coordination among all groups which must complement each other on the resolution of a gap or overlap in Smart Grid technologies.</p><p>The first of these focus areas, analysis, is provided in the SGIP through the working group structure, primarily through the Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs). The second of these focus areas, coordination, is provided in the SGIP through the origination and oversight of the Priority Action Plan (PAP) groups. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SGIP Standing Committees and Permanent Working 5.2. Groups</head><p>Much of the work of the SGIP is carried out by standing committees and permanent working groups. There are two standing committees-the Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC) and the Smart Grid Testing and Certification Committee (SGTCC). At the present time, the SGIP has established one permanent working group, the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG). <ref type="bibr">99</ref> There are also a number of ad hoc working groups, including Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs) and Priority Action Plans (PAPs).</p><p>The SGIP was established to further the development of consensus-based Smart Grid interoperability standards. NIST staff hold key technical positions in the SGIP, including Chair of the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG), Vice Chair of the Testing and Certification Committee (TCC), Chair or Co-chair of the Building-to-Grid (B2G), Industrial-to-Grid (I2G), Home-to-Grid (H2G), Transmission and Distribution (TnD), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs), each of the 19 PAPs, as well as coordination roles with the Program Management Office (PMO), SGIP Plenary and GB officers. NIST leadership on these committees and working groups provides strong support for the acceleration of the standards necessary for the safe, secure, and reliable Smart Grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC) and Smart Grid Testing and Certification Committee (SGTCC)</head><p>The SGAC is responsible for creating and refining a conceptual reference model and developing a conceptual architectural framework supporting the standards and profiles necessary to implement the vision of the Smart Grid. The SGTCC creates and maintains the necessary documentation and organizational framework for compliance, interoperability, and cybersecurity testing and certification for Smart Grid standards recommended by SGIP. Further details on the activities and plans of these groups are found in Chapter 3 (SGAC) and Chapter 7 (SGTCC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG)</head><p>The primary objective of the CSWG is to assess standards for applicability and interoperability across the domains of the Smart Grid, rather than develop a single set of cybersecurity requirements that are applicable to all elements of the Smart Grid. These standards will be assessed within an overall risk management framework that focuses on cybersecurity within the Smart Grid. These objectives include:</p><p>• Assessing SGIP-identified standards within an overall risk assessment framework that focuses on cyber security within the Smart Grid;</p><p>• Developing a set of recommended high level security requirements in a guidance document that may be used by strategists, designers, implementers, and operators of the Smart Grid (e.g., utilities, equipment manufacturers, and regulators) as input to their risk assessment process and other tasks in the security life cycle of a Smart Grid information system. These security requirements are intended as a starting point for organizations;</p><p>• Identifying Smart Grid-specific cybersecurity problems and issues that currently do not have solutions;</p><p>• Creating a logical reference model of the Smart Grid, which will enable further work towards the creation of a logical architecture and a security architecture. This work is being performed in coordination with the SGIP SGAC;</p><p>• Identifying inherent privacy risk areas and feasible ways in which those risks may be mitigated while at the same time supporting and maintaining the value and benefits of the Smart Grid; and</p><p>• Developing a conformity assessment program for security requirements in coordination with activities of the SGIP SGTCC.</p><p>Further details on the CSWG activities and plans can be found in Chapter 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SGIP Catalog of Standards 5.3.</head><p>The purpose and scope of the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS), as well as the process and procedures for its management, are described both in Section 4.5 and on the SGIP CoS Web site. <ref type="bibr">100</ref> The CoS processes were finalized in May 2011, and the SGIP Project Management Office (PMO) has now assigned the standards from Tables 4-1 and 4-2 that have not been through the CoS process, to the relevant Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs) to apply the CoS processes to them. These processes include: 1) coordinating with the Standards Development Organization (SDO) and other groups that maintain the standards to get the Standards Information Forms completed; 2) coordinating with the SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) and Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC) to get their reviews completed; and 3) completing the Criteria and Analysis form to qualify the standard as meeting the CoS criteria. It is intended that all of the standards in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">4-1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref>-2 be reviewed for the CoS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs) 5.4.</head><p>DEWGs provide expertise in specific application areas, as well as a rich understanding of the current and future requirements for Smart Grid applications. Due to their open membership and collaborative process, DEWGs integrate a wide array of stakeholder expertise and interests. Through their understanding of Smart Grid applications, DEWGs expose and model the applications in use cases, cataloged in the IKB. The applications are analyzed against functional and nonfunctional requirements, and against the potential standards that fulfill them. Through their analysis, DEWGs can allocate functionality to actors, standards, and technologies, and thus support the fulfillment of Smart Grid applications. By this means, the DEWGs can discover the gaps and overlaps of standards for the Smart Grid, as well as identify which technologies best fit the requirements necessary for carrying out the applications. The results of these analyses are the identification of:</p><p>• Smart Grid standards and the nature of their fit to the applications;</p><p>• Additional PAPs that are needed to address the gaps and overlaps; and</p><p>• High-priority use cases that merit detailed analysis and development.</p><p>The DEWGs as of February 2012 include:</p><p>• Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) -This DEWG works to enhance reliability and improve resilience to grid instabilities and disturbances. It also works to improve power quality to meet customer needs and efficiency, and to enable ready access for distributed generators to the grid. Recent activities include creating a list of phasor data concentrator requirements, conducting the initial discussions to determine if efforts related to electromagnetic interference should be a PAP or a Working Group and recommended to the SGIPGB that an Electromagnetic Interoperability Issues (EMII) Working Group be established, creating a white paper on weather-related standards, and providing technical comments to NIST on the Guiding Principles for Identifying Standards for Implementation from Release 1.0.</p><p>• Home-to-Grid (H2G) -This DEWG is investigating communications between utilities and home devices to facilitate demand response programs that implement energy management.</p><p>The DEWG has agreed on a set of goals and has written white papers for the four target segments: government, electric industry, consumers, and residential product manufacturers.</p><p>The DEWG has produced six white papers: Requirements; The Key Starting Point for a Business-Level Roadmap to Achieve Interoperable Networks, Systems, Devices in the Smart Grid; Privacy of Consumer Information in the Electric Power Industry; Free Market Choice for Appliance Physical Layer Communications; Appliance Socket Interface; and Electromagnetic Compatibility Issues for Home-to-Grid Devices<ref type="foot" target="#foot_45">foot_45</ref> .</p><p>• Building-to-Grid (B2G) -This DEWG represents the interests and needs of building consumers. It envisions conditions that enable commercial buildings to participate in energy markets and perform effective energy conservation and management. The DEWG is responsible for identifying interoperability issues relevant to the building customer and providing direction on how to address those issues. The B2G DEWG has examined use cases for weather data exchange and proposed an approach for standard weather data exchange, and has participated in the formation and further development of the concept of the Energy Services Interface (ESI) and definition of the customer interface. The DEWG has also explored energy management beyond electricity (e.g., combined heat and power [CHP], district energy, thermal storage, etc.).</p><p>• Distributed Renewables, Generators, and Storage (DRGS) -This DEWG provides a forum to identify standards and interoperability issues and gaps related to Smart Grid integration of distributed renewable/clean energy generators and electric storage, and to initiate PAPs and task groups to address identified issues and gaps. Significant technical challenges exist in this area and resolution of these issues and gaps is essential to enable high penetrations of distributed renewable/clean generator and storage devices while also enhancing rather than degrading grid stability, resiliency, power quality, and safety.</p><p>• Industry-to-Grid (I2G) -This DEWG identifies business and policy objectives and requisite interactions, and also identifies standard services and interfaces needed for interoperability (e.g., syntax and semantics of information transfer, service interface protocols). This DEWG is preparing a transition strategy for future energy transfers between industrial facilities and the electric grid, in various manifestations, to meet fluctuating demand at predictable quality and price. This should be accomplished while acknowledging variable supplier delivery capability and regulatory requirements, and while optimizing energy conservation. This DEWG developed a presentation, on the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Systems (OASIS) Energy Interoperation Technical Committee (EITC), which defines the interaction between the Smart Grid and smart facilities.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_46">foot_46</ref> </p><p>• Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) -This DEWG identifies the service interfaces and standards needed (e.g., syntax and semantics of information transfer, service interface protocols, cross-cutting issues, business-and policy-level issues) to create the infrastructure to make plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) a reality. This DEWG defines business objectives and prioritizes corresponding PEV-grid interactions (discharging as well as charging) that can occur at different locations under one billing account. The goal for this DEWG is to ensure that the basic infrastructure will be implemented in time to support one million PEVs by 2015.</p><p>• Business and Policy (BnP) -This DEWG assists business decision makers and legislative/regulatory policymakers in implementing Smart Grid policies relevant to interoperability by providing a structured approach that may be used by state and federal policymakers and by trade organizations to implement Smart Grid policies, and helps to clearly define the interoperability implications and benefits of Smart Grid policy. This DEWG serves as an educational resource and develops tools and supporting materials. The BnP DEWG sponsored a presentation to members of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) on behalf of NIST and the SGIP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional SGIP Working Groups 5.5.</head><p>In addition to the DEWGs, there are other working groups established to examine issues in particular areas and, if appropriate, recommend the creation of new PAPs. These working groups are described below.</p><p>• Terminology (TERM) -This working group seeks to establish a common process and approach around current and developing terms and definitions in use within each of the SGIP working groups. A review and compilation of terms used by the various SGIP working groups will minimize misunderstandings and inconsistent approaches, and it will provide a common foundation and understanding for all stakeholders. This group will collect the definitions of existing and new terms from a wide variety of sources. This lexicon of SGIPand Smart Grid-related terms will be published on the IKB site<ref type="foot" target="#foot_47">foot_47</ref> .</p><p>• Electromagnetic Interoperability Issues (EMII) -This working group investigates strategies for enhancing the immunity of Smart Grid devices and systems to the detrimental effects of natural and man-made electromagnetic interference, both radiated and conducted. It addresses these electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues and develops recommendations for the application of standards and testing criteria to ensure EMC for the Smart Grid. In particular, the group focuses on issues directly related to interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems, including impacts, avoidance, and generation of electromagnetic interference, as well as mitigation of and immunity to electromagnetic interference. With its focus on interoperability, this effort is not a general review of electromagnetic-and electric power-related issues, such as power quality. These issues are addressed by different groups outside the SGIP.</p><p>• Internet Protocol Standards (IPS) -This working group promotes the availability of IPS to support Smart Grid functionality. The goal is to enable interoperability by providing guidance and best practices to vendors, utilities, and implementers of the Smart Grid. This working group will also consider functionality related to the use of the Internet Protocol Suite in the Smart Grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5-2. PAP Project Life Cycle</head><p>Priority Action Plans (PAPs) 5.6.</p><p>PAPs are a key activity of the SGIP. They arise from the analysis of the applicability of standards to Smart Grid use cases and are targeted to resolve specific critical issues. PAPs are created only when the SGIP determines there is a need for interoperability coordination on some urgent issue. Specifically, a PAP addresses one of the following situations:</p><p>• A gap exists, where a standard or standard extension is needed. (The need for meter image-download requirements is an example of a nonexistent standard needed to fill an identified gap.)</p><p>• An overlap exists, where two complementary standards address some information that is in common but different for the same scope of an application. An example of this is metering information, where the Common Information Model (CIM), 61850, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C12.19, Smart Energy Profile (SEP) 1.0, and SEP 2.0 all have nonequivalent methods of representing revenue meter readings.</p><p>PAP activities include coordinating with the relevant SDOs and SSOs to get standards developed, revised, or harmonized. Once the standards are completed and reviewed through the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS) process, the outputs of the PAP is a recommendation to the SGIPGB for consideration for the CoS along with the associated CoS review documentation<ref type="foot" target="#foot_48">foot_48</ref> .</p><p>PAPs are created when the SGIPGB receives proposals from SGIP members, working groups, committees, or other interested parties who have identified issues with interoperability standards, such as a gap or overlap among standards. The SGIPGB approves the PAP proposal, and experts in relevant Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and SSOs are brought together to create the PAP working group management team. The PAPs themselves are executed within the scopes of participating SDOs and users groups that sign up for tasks that implement the plans. The SGIP facilitates this process and ensures that all PAP materials are publicly available promptly on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site.</p><p>The SGIP also offers guidance to the PAP team to move difficult discussions toward resolution. Although PAPs and SDOs work together closely, there may be times when the SDOs and PAPs disagree based on their constituent viewpoints. Specific PAP tasks may diverge from the original intent of the PAP due to the SDOs' natural, and correct, orientation towards their own specific goals and needs. The PAPs, on the other hand, arise from the broader stakeholder involvement in the Smart Grid problem space, and the goals identified for a PAP reflect this broader scope. In these cases, the parties are brought together under the auspices of the SGIP, and an attempt to resolve the differences is pursued. It will be possible to communicate information about those electrical loads to utilities, other electrical service providers, and market operators.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future SGIP Activities 5.8.</head><p>This section contains a sampling of activities that will be completed by the SGIP in the future. They were selected because they were recently begun by the SGIP and are anticipated to have significant impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8.1.">SEP1.x Migration (PAP18)</head><p>Over the past few years, smart meter deployments have been steadily increasing, with millions of meters being installed. Concurrent with this widespread deployment and the NIST-established SGIP standards acceleration effort, the Department of Energy (DOE) awarded $3.4 billion in Smart Grid Investment Grants in 2009. In late 2006, an effort was undertaken in the ZigBee Alliance, an SSO that develops wireless standards and certifies wireless products, to define a smart energy application profile based on interest from meter companies, utilities and in-home device manufacturers. The application profile was designated as the "ZigBee Smart Energy Profile (SEP)." This profile was released in 2008 and was based on the existing ZigBee PRO stack, a binary application protocol unique to the ZigBee Alliance for networking over the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and using elliptic curve cryptography from a single supplier. Currently, over 100 products have been certified to SEP 1.0.</p><p>In late 2009, a liaison was launched between the ZigBee Alliance and the HomePlug Alliance to define the next evolution of the profile, dubbed "SEP 2.0." In this version, ZigBee addressed several key features, including support of multiple Media Access Control/Physical (MAC/PHY) layers, multiple security protocols, and requirements from the Open Home Area Network (OpenHAN) organization. As a result of significant architectural changes and feature upgrades, SEP 2.0 is not backwards-compatible with SEP 1.x at the network and application layers or in the security architecture. This is a known issue and has been broadly communicated as the development of SEP 2.0 has progressed. Because many meters are being or have already been deployed using SEP 1.x, there is much discussion on whether an upgrade is necessary and, if so, what that transition and migration path should look like. The main focus and outputs of the PAP are:</p><p>• PAP 18 was formed to develop specific requirements that must be met to allow for the coexistence of SEP 1.x and 2.0 and to support the migration of SEP 1.x implementations to SEP 2.0. This effort will not address the issue of whether new deployments should be SEP 1.x or SEP 2.0, which is a deployment-specific issue. The effort assumes 1.x in the field as the starting point. Further, this effort assumes that the meters themselves are capable of running SEP 1.x or SEP 2.0 via remote firmware upgrade. The focus of the effort is on the events leading up to and impact of such an upgrade.</p><p>• The primary outputs of the PAP are 1) a white paper that summarizes the key issues with migration from SEP 1.x to SEP 2.0 and makes specific recommendations; and 2) a requirements document that will be submitted to the ZigBee Alliance for consideration in developing the technology specific recommendations, solutions, and any required changes to the SEP 2.0 specifications themselves. New Distributed Renewables, Generators, and Storage Domain Expert Working Group</p><p>The SGIP has created a Distributed Renewables, Generators, and Storage (DRGS) Domain Expert Working Group (DEWG) to provide a forum within the SGIP to identify standards and interoperability issues and gaps related to Smart Grid integration of distributed renewable/clean energy generators and electric storage, and to initiate priority action plans and task groups to address these issues and gaps. Resolution of these issues and gaps is essential to enable high penetration of renewables and storage while also enhancing grid stability, resiliency, power quality, and safety.</p><p>Of particular importance are Smart Grid functions that 1) enable grid integration of intermittent distributed renewable generators, 2) enable distributed generator/storage devices to provide valuable grid supportive ancillary services, 3) prevent unintentional islanding of clustered distributed generator/storage devices, and 4) provide acceptable distributed generator/storage device fault response without cascading events. The DRGS DEWG will also address communication needed for distributed control of generator/storage devices within weak grids and microgrids, including the interaction of devices having high-bandwidth power electronics-based grid interfaces (such as photovoltaic generators and battery storage) with rotating machine devices having high intrinsic inertia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8.2.">Addition of Reliability and Implementation Inputs to Catalog of Standards Life Cycle Process</head><p>The SGIP is considering methods to solicit additional inputs and guidance from Smart Grid stakeholders regarding reliability and implementation issues raised by standards completing the Catalog of Standards (CoS) life cycle process. Stakeholders engaged in this fashion would review documents and standards that are considered for addition to the CoS. These reviews would provide analysis to industry and regulators of the potential impacts to system reliability, efficiency, and implementation. It is believed that this approach will facilitate greater involvement by utilities in the SGIP CoS's life cycle process. To address this, the SGIP has created the Implementation Methods Committee (IMC), which is expected to hold its first meeting in March 2012. The IMC mission is to identify, develop and support mechanisms and tools for objective standards impact assessment, transition management and technology transfer in order to assist in deployment of standards based Smart Grid devices, systems and infrastructure. The committee output shall be report/guideline documents that address the focus items of the scope. When available, the content of the report/guideline documents shall be included directly (e.g. for items to be included as Attributes in the Standards Information Form (SIF)) and referenced within the SGIP SIF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Cybersecurity Strategy</head><p>Cybersecurity in the Smart Grid 6.1.</p><p>Traditionally, cybersecurity for information technology (IT) focuses on the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Cybersecurity for the Smart Grid requires an expansion of this focus to address the combined power system, IT, and communication systems in order to maintain the reliability and the security of the Smart Grid to reduce the impact of coordinated cyber-physical attacks, <ref type="bibr">108</ref> and to protect the privacy of consumers. Smart Grid cybersecurity must include a balance of both power-and cyber-system technologies and processes in IT and in power system operations and governance. When practices from one sector, such as the IT or communications sector, are applied directly to the power sector, care must be taken because such practices may degrade reliability and increase risk. This is because the requirements for the power sector, for timing of communications, for example, may be different from the IT and communications sectors.</p><p>Therefore, cybersecurity for the power industry must cover all issues involving automation and communications that affect the operation of electric power systems and the functioning of the utilities that manage them. Education of the power industry about cybersecurity policy, procedures, and techniques-as well as on the various management, operational, and technical requirements that are necessary and available to secure power system resources-must be conducted. In the power industry, the focus has been on implementation of equipment that could improve power system reliability. Communications and IT equipment were formerly viewed as just supporting power system reliability. However, both the communications and IT sectors are becoming more critical to the reliability of the power system.</p><p>Cybersecurity must address deliberate attacks, industrial espionage, and inadvertent compromises of the information infrastructure due to user errors, equipment failures, and natural disasters. Vulnerabilities might allow networks to be penetrated, control software to be accessed, and load conditions to be altered, thus destabilizing the electric grid in unpredictable ways. Many electric sector infrastructures were designed and installed decades ago with limited cybersecurity consideration. Increasing connectivity, integration with legacy systems, the proliferation of access points, escalating system complexity, and wider use of common operating systems and platforms may contribute to increased risks for the Smart Grid. The potential risk to critical infrastructure as a result of coordinated attacks against the Smart Grid or cyber-attacks in conjunction with natural disasters/phenomena is another reason why a defense-in-depth approach to Smart Grid cybersecurity should be adopted. <ref type="bibr">108</ref> Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report 11-117, "Electricity Grid Modernization: Progress Being Made on Cybersecurity Guidelines, but Key Challenges Remain to Be Addressed" defines cyber-physical attack as using both cyber and physical means to attack a target.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NIST's Role in Smart Grid Cybersecurity 6.2.</head><p>To address the cross-cutting issue of cybersecurity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established the Cybersecurity Coordination Task Group (CSCTG) in early 2009. This group was integrated into the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) as a standing working group and was renamed the SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG). The CSWG has designated liaisons within the Smart Grid Architecture Committee (SGAC), the Smart Grid Testing and Certification Committee (SGTCC), and the Priority Action Plans (PAPs). Some members of the CSWG are also active participants in the SGAC, the SGTCC, the PAPs, and the Domain Expert Working Groups (DEWGs) in the SGIP.</p><p>As specified in the SGIP Charter and Bylaws, a NIST representative chairs the CSWG. The CSWG management team also includes three vice chairs and a secretariat-volunteers from the membership who are able to commit on average 20 hours a week to CSWG activities. In addition, three full-time support staff serve on the team. Currently, there are eight subgroups, with each subgroup containing one or two leads. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">6</ref>-1 provides a description of the subgroups and their activities. The CSWG now has more than 650 participants, comprising national and international members from 22 Smart Grid stakeholder categories including utilities, vendors, and service providers, academia, regulatory organizations, state and local government, and federal agencies. Members of the CSWG assist in defining the activities and tasks of the CSWG, attend the SGIP and SGIP Governing Board (SGIPGB) meetings, and participate in the development and review of the CSWG subgroups' projects and deliverables.</p><p>A biweekly conference call is held by the CSWG chair to update the membership on the subgroups' activities, SGIP activities, and other related information. Subgroups hold regular conference calls while actively working on a project. An active outreach program was established in August 2010, with members participating in the all-day events held across the country. Information on the CSWG, subgroups, outreach, and all associated documents can be found on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_49">foot_49</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-Level Requirements Subgroup</head><p>The High-Level Requirements (HLR) subgroup developed an initial set of security requirements applicable to the Smart Grid, published in NISTIR 7628. The security requirements are specified for logical interface categories rather than for individual logical interfaces. To create the initial set of security requirements, this subgroup reviewed security source documents, and then identified and tailored existing security requirements applicable to the Smart Grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Privacy Subgroup</head><p>The Privacy subgroup conducted a privacy impact assessment (PIA) for the consumer-to-utility portion of the Smart Grid to include an initial set of issues and guidelines for protecting privacy within the Smart Grid environment. The Privacy subgroup continues to investigate privacy concerns including interfaces between consumers and non-utility third parties, as well as utilities and other third parties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Subgroup</head><p>The R&amp;D subgroup identifies problems that arise or are expected to arise in the Smart Grid that do not yet have commercially viable solutions. The R&amp;D subgroup identified in NISTIR 7628 an initial set of high-priority R&amp;D challenges, as well as R&amp;D themes that warrant further discussion. Many of the topics are now being addressed by other industry groups, by federal agencies, and by the Design Principles subgroup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standards Subgroup</head><p>The Standards subgroup assesses standards and other documents with respect to the cybersecurity and privacy requirements from NISTIR 7628.

The objective is to keep all individuals informed and aware of activities of the CSWG, allowing for collaboration between the various groups. Current and future coordination activities will include information exchanges with the Department of Defense, DOE, Federal Bureau of Investigation, FERC, NERC, National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization (NESCO), and Smart Grid Security. Other federal agencies and industry groups will be added as information exchanges and requirements continue to be developed.</p></div>

The CSWG will continue to schedule face-to-face meetings on an as-needed basis and during SGIP events in order to provide a venue for the following activities:</p><p>• Have technical working sessions on specific cybersecurity areas;</p><p>• Plan future activities of the CSWG; and</p><p>• Coordinate tasks that fall under multiple subgroups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.8.">SGIP Liaisons</head><p>The SGIP consists of a Governing Board, Program Management Office, standing committees, DEWGs, and PAPs. The CSWG has established a liaison with each of these groups to exchange information and to ensure that the cross-cutting issue of cybersecurity is addressed. Because there are numerous PAPs established, significant CSWG resources are spent as liaisons to the PAPs. The liaisons must answer a list of questions created by the CSWG which, along with subsequent activities to ensure good cybersecurity coverage in each PAP, results in a considerable investment in time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NIST-Initiated Efforts Supporting the Framework 7.1. Development</head><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recognizes the importance of ensuring the development and implementation of an interoperability testing and certification 123 framework for Smart Grid standards. In order to support interoperability of Smart Grid systems and products, Smart Grid products developed to conform to the interoperability framework should undergo a rigorous standard conformance and interoperability testing process.</p><p>Within NIST's three-phase plan to expedite the acceleration of interoperable Smart Grid standards, developing and implementing a framework for Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification constitutes Phase III. In recognition of the importance of Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification and the need to couple it to standards identified for the Smart Grid, developing and implementing a framework for Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification is an integral part of the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) activities, carried out by a permanent Smart Grid Testing and Certification Committee (SGTCC) within the SGIP.</p><p>The SGTCC has the responsibility for constructing an operational framework, as well as the action plans for development of documentation and associated artifacts supporting testing and certification programs that support Smart Grid interoperability.</p><p>Recognizing that some efforts exist today to test products and services based on certain Smart Grid standards, and others are under way, NIST is working with stakeholders and actors through the SGIP to develop and implement an operational framework for interoperability testing and certification that supports, augments, and leverages existing programs wherever practical.</p><p>To support the accelerated development of an operational framework, NIST initiated and completed the following two major efforts in calendar year 2010: 1) performed an assessment of existing Smart Grid standards testing programs, and 2) provided high-level guidance for the development of a testing and certification framework. Taking input from NIST, the SGTCC has developed a comprehensive roadmap for developing and implementing the operational framework and related action plans, and has launched a number of focused efforts to develop various documents, tools, and components for the framework. Further development and implementation of the operational framework by the SGTCC is an ongoing process.</p><p>Once implemented, feedback from interoperability testing and certification programs to standards-setting organizations (SSOs) and other relevant bodies will become another important aspect of the Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification framework. Errors, <ref type="bibr">123</ref> The term "conformity assessment" was used in Release 1.0 of the NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards to describe this NIST program. However, the term "interoperability testing and certification" is considered more accurate and appropriate in describing the nature of the program and the objective of Phase III of NIST's three-phase plan for ensuring the interoperability of Smart Grid standards. Release 2.0 will use the term "interoperability testing and certification" to describe this program and the framework hereafter.</p><p>clarifications, and enhancements to existing standards are typically identified throughout the normal interoperability testing and certification process. In order to improve the interoperability of the Smart Grid, an overall process is critical to ensure that changes and enhancements are incorporated continuously, and this process has been included in the framework development by the SGTCC.</p><p>The SGTCC provides continuing visibility for Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification efforts and programs. The SGTCC will engage all stakeholders to recommend improvements and means to fill gaps, and will work with current standards bodies and user groups to develop and implement new test programs to fill voids in Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification. NIST will continue to work closely with the SGTCC in these efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1.">Assessment of Existing Smart Grid Standards Testing Programs</head><p>NIST initiated and completed an in-depth study in early 2010 to assess the existing testing and certification programs associated with the priority Smart Grid standards identified by NIST. The results of this study provided NIST and the SGIP's SGTCC with the current status of existing testing programs for ensuring interoperability, cybersecurity, and other relevant characteristics. Information gathered for these programs include all elements of a conformity assessment system, including accreditation bodies, certification bodies, testing and calibration laboratories, inspection bodies, personnel certification programs, and quality registrars. The study also helped to uncover present gaps and deficiencies in the evaluated programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment Metrics Used in the Study</head><p>The study was conducted using a set of metrics for an ideal testing and certification program. These metrics are derived from the best practices found among standards testing and certification programs from a variety of organizations both related and unrelated to the power system. The metrics used in the study are:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_58">foot_58</ref> • Conformance vs. Interoperability vs. Security testing-assessing whether there is a testing and conformity assessment program for a standard that addresses these three areas:</p><p> whether an implementation conforms to the standard as published-conformance;  whether multiple implementations are interoperable with each otherinteroperability; and  whether the implementation correctly makes use of any security features from the standard or other security features available in the device or computer system housing the implementation-security.</p><p>• Published test procedures-assessing whether there is a published/publicly reviewed test procedure for the standard;</p><p>• Independent test labs-assessing whether there are any independent test labs not operated by product vendors;</p><p>• Lab accreditation-assessing whether there is a lab accreditation process for the lab performing the tests (The accreditation could be done by the lab itself or by another entity.);</p><p>• Certification/logo-assessing whether there is a certification or logo program for the standard;</p><p>• Feedback to standard-assessing whether there is a mechanism to improve the quality of the standard, the test procedures, and/or the operation of the test labs;</p><p>• Conformance checklist-assessing whether implementers are provided with a checklist or template in a standardized, published format to indicate what portions of the standard they have implemented;</p><p>• Self-certification-assessing whether it is possible for technology providers to selfcertify its implementations;</p><p>• Reference implementation-assessing whether a reference or "golden" implementation of the standard is available; and • Mature standard-assessing whether the standard is considered as a mature one according to several aspects (e.g., how long it has been published (&gt; 5 years), number of implementations (&gt; 1), mandated (by government, etc.), revisions made, etc.).</p><p>uncovered in the "Existing Conformity Landscape" report. <ref type="bibr">129</ref> The guide defined and discussed the scope, the rationale, and the need for developing a comprehensive framework and action plan for Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification. The document also described various actors that have a primary role in ensuring that interoperability is achieved and presented a highlevel workflow and framework artifacts for guiding the framework development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals of the Framework</head><p>As stated in the guide, the primary goal of creating a testing and certification framework is to have a comprehensive approach to close the gaps uncovered in the NIST-initiated study and to accelerate the development and implementation of industry programs that enable Smart Grid interoperability. The goals of the framework are that it must:</p><p>• Help ensure a consistent level of testing for products based on the same Smart Grid standards, as well as ensure consistency in the implementation of test programs among different standards;</p><p>• Address test implementation and execution issues, including qualification criteria for test laboratories and accrediting organizations, and recommend best practices to ensure that test results achieve their desired intent and are used in an appropriate and consistent manner; and</p><p>• Take into consideration the evolutionary progression of the Smart Grid, and be structured to allow maturation of existing technologies and introduction of emerging technologies.</p><p>In addition, in order for a framework for testing and certification program for Smart Grid systems and devices to be successful and broadly adopted, these programs must be financially viable. Two key factors to a successful new testing and certification program are:</p><p>• The cost of testing must be reasonable relative to other product costs and volume of deployment, because any testing cost becomes part of the total cost of a product. This is critical for containing the total cost of a product.</p><p>• The cost of testing must be reasonable relative to the risk of product failure in the field. Product failures in the field create cost because they may require technical remedies to be performed in the field, equipment to be replaced, service interruptions, and reduced customer satisfaction. Testing may identify these problems before the product is deployed. However, the testing costs should be justified by the risk of the potential costs associated with the failed product after deployment so that overall cost is minimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elements of the Framework for Testing and Certification</head><p>The development guide is structured in accordance with NIST's outlined goals for a final operational framework for Smart Grid interoperability standards testing and certification, that should, minimally, include the following elements:</p><p>• Qualification criteria for test laboratories and development of test reports;</p><p>• Qualification criteria for issuing certification documents;</p><p>• Example processes (i.e., use cases and case studies) and documentation associated with testing and certification activities that can mature over time and in concert with in-thefield deployments and technology evolution;</p><p>• Example processes that can be used in providing feedback, including best practices, to the various industry-recognized standards groups, vendors, legislators, and regulators-in order to improve standards and conformance documentation, such as test reports and certifications;</p><p>• Processes to address standards testability gaps and test capability issues that can be used to identify and communicate the need for additional working groups in support of interoperability standards development, testing, and certification;</p><p>• Recommended practices to evaluate and assess the depth of testing requirements, both for individual standards and for collections of standards that combine to address specific deployment issues;</p><p>• Recommended practices on test method and procedures documentation, as well as the use of test cases and test profiles, where applicable, in addressing interoperability issues;</p><p>• Recommended practices for the development of testing and certification profiles based upon industry-developed use cases;</p><p>• Recommended practices on the validation of test plans and test cases to help ensure alignment with the intent of standards and appropriate representation of expected usage in deployment. This should also include processes on the use of standardized test references or test beds (e.g. "golden" reference models and test platforms); and</p><p>• Where feasible and appropriate, these framework elements should be adopted and/or derived from existing international standards for conformance testing frameworks.</p><p>During the second half of 2011, the SGTCC assessed lessons learned in early efforts by Interoperability Testing and Certification Authorities (ITCAs) in implementation of the IPRM V 1.0 and used those findings to update the IPRM V 2.0, releasing the new version in January 2012. The new issue of the IPRM transitioned the first version of the document from an informational focus to an operational focus, providing greater clarity to ITCAs to guide their implementation of the IPRM recommendations. It incorporates internationally recognized quality and performance standards for certification bodies and test laboratories to provide confidence to end purchasers (e.g. utilities) and requirements for testing procedures to assure that testing is comprehensive and rigorous as required to meet deployment expectations.</p><p>The SGTCC is successfully collaborating with ITCAs and 3rd party industry assessment and accreditation providers to implement the IPRM Version 2 recommendations. During 2011, six ITCAs announced plans to implement the IPRM recommendations within their programs (NEMA, UCAIug, OpenADR, MultiSpeak, SEP2 Consortia and USnap Alliance). In January 2012, five organizations that provide independent accreditation of test labs and certification bodies announced their intent to begin offering services in 2012 in support of the SGIP testing recommendations. These include the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), Laboratory Accreditation Bureau (L-A-B), ACLASS, and Perry Johnson Lab Accreditation. The first joint meeting between ITCAs and accreditors is being planned for the first half of 2012. This will help the accreditors plan the necessary services for assessment of an ITCA's labs and certification bodies for operation of their testing and certification programs.</p><p>Another aspect of the framework development was the development of an evaluation tool. The Interoperability Maturity Assessment Model (IMAM) is used for assessing the maturity of a standards-setting activity relative to the achievement of interoperable products.</p><p>The following sections provide a brief overview of the results of these two SGTCC framework development activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1.">Summary of the Interoperability Process Reference Manual (IPRM) Framework of the Interoperability Process</head><p>The framework of the interoperability testing and certification process centers on the concept of having an Interoperability Testing and Certification Authority (ITCA) for each identified Smart Grid standard. As defined in the IPRM by SGTCC, an ITCA will be "the organization whose function is to promote and facilitate the introduction of interoperable products based on a standard into the marketplace." <ref type="bibr">133</ref> In its study, NIST identified that "standards [that] moved from release to market adoptions very frequently had this type of organization defined. Those that • Technical Design for Interoperability and Conformance Program Design defines the requirements needed to effectively manage the procedures and processes associated with interoperability and conformance testing.</p><p>• Improvements cover the controls that are required to support the interoperability testing processes.</p><p>• Cybersecurity covers the requirements that shall be used by the ITCA to validate the security-related components of the interoperability testing program.</p><p>Adoption of these requirements by an ITCA is essential for implementing a successful interoperability testing and certification program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leverage on Industry Best Practices</head><p>In addition to meeting the governance, lab qualification, technical design, improvements, and cybersecurity requirements, ITCAs should also leverage industry's best practices in their implementations. The IPRM has included a list of recommended best practices and guidelines for ITCAs in their development and operation of interoperability and conformance testing programs. The recommendations provided in the IPRM were generated based on input from experienced testing organizations that have evolved interoperability and conformance programs through lessons learned in executing tests for both software and hardware applications.</p><p>The recommendations may not apply directly to all testing applications; however, NIST and the SGTCC recommend that ITCAs consider them for interoperability and conformance test programs, as these practices have proven to be valuable in executing a broad cross-section of program types. Each ITCA should evaluate how these recommendations, observations, and practices apply to their specific programs and should incorporate the recommendations into their programs where applicable.</p><p>The recommended best practices in interoperability test constructs in the IPRM address three main areas: o That it restrict the standard but cannot be added to the standard;</p><p>o That it clearly define the type of the profile and provide a name that clearly defines the objective/scope of the profile; and o That it be a companion document or incorporated by the SSO into its standard.</p><p>The recommendations provided in the IPRM may not apply directly to all testing applications. However, it is recommended by the SGTCC that ITCAs consider them for their interoperability and conformance test programs as these practices have proven to be valuable in executing a broad cross-section of program types. Each ITCA should evaluate how these recommendations, observations, and practices apply to their specific programs, and should incorporate the recommendations into their programs where applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2.">Interoperability Maturity Assessment Model</head><p>The SGTCC has further developed and refined the assessment metrics into a more rigorous Interoperability Maturity Assessment Model (IMAM). <ref type="bibr">137</ref> The IMAM, developed and refined by the SGTCC, includes associated metrics and tools for quick and high-level maturity assessment of a standard's testing and certification program. The IMAM is an extension and refinement of the process used in the NIST study report. It includes "filtering" metrics for evaluating critical characteristics of a successful test program, and "assessment" metrics for deeper evaluation of specific strengths and weaknesses of a test program. These metrics can be evaluated through a spreadsheet questionnaire developed by the SGTCC, which includes more detailed questions for each metric.</p><p>The "filtering" metrics measure a test program with respect to the following four areas:</p><p>• Interoperability Testing and Certification Authority (ITCA) as defined in the IPRM-The existence of a functional ITCA that meets ITCA requirements indicates the maturity and stability of a test program.</p><p>• Technical Specification Structure-The existence of a standard/specification that has clear conformance requirements and few options/extensions makes it much easier to develop a test and certification program. The "assessment" metrics evaluate the strength and weakness of a test program with respect to the following eight areas:</p><p>• Customer Maturity and Discipline-Customers' insistence that their vendors adhere to standards and meet stringent criteria for interoperability is critical for the success of interoperability standards.</p><p>• Conformance vs. Interoperability vs. Security Testing-Conformance testing determines if an implementation conforms to a standard as written. Interoperability testing verifies if two or more implementations of a standard can successfully communicate with each other. Security testing analyzes whether the implementation correctly makes use of any security features from the standard or other security features available in the device or computer system housing the implementation. A mature test program should include all three tests.</p><p>• Published Test Procedures/Reference-A publicly published and reviewed test procedure/reference is, in general, more mature, more comprehensive, and more complete than one which is not publicly published.</p><p>• Independent Test Labs-Independent test labs are preferred, because they are more likely to be unbiased in their testing, and are likely to incorporate lessons learned from testing one implementation into the next set of tests.</p><p>• Feedback on Standards-The existence of a mechanism to provide feedbacks to standard development helps improve the quality of the standard, the test procedures, and/or the operation of the test labs.</p><p>• Conformance/Interoperability Checklist-A standard conformance/interoperability checklist can improve interoperability by allowing users to easily specify and compare implementations.</p><p>• Supplemental Test Tools and Test Suites-The existence of independently developed testing tools and test suites that also cover optional features and requirements is an important feature to avoid issues in standard conformance and interoperability among different implementations.</p><p>• Sustainability of Test Programs-A sustainable test program has these characteristics:</p><p> Customers are willing to pay a premium for a certified product;</p><p> Vendors are willing and motivated to pay for a thorough set of test tools and certifications; and  Independent test labs and test-writing organizations can make a reasonable return on investments in the standard.</p><p>The Interoperability Maturity Assessment Model, once finished and refined, could provide a unique set of tools for assessing the maturity of a Smart Grid Testing and Certification program for products conforming to a standard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further Development and Implementation of the 7.3. Frameworks</head><p>NIST and the SGTCC are working on a number of activities to resolve related issues for supporting the interoperability testing and certification framework. These activities include the following:</p><p>• Developing ITCA evaluation processes-The SGTCC is developing processes/tools to enable ITCA test laboratories and certification bodies to conform to the IPRM requirements. The processes may include establishing liaison relationships between the SGTCC and ITCAs, developing auditing process for ITCAs, and other necessary functions to support IPRM implementation.</p><p>o This activity targets the development of guidance documents and/or assessment tools. The ITCA evaluation process is an ongoing activity, supporting ITCAs as they become ready to undergo the assessment process.</p><p>• Developing end-to-end or system testing methodology-End-to-end testing and/or system testing typically involves verifying the interoperability of products spanning multiple standards. The SGTCC has formed a new working group to develop an end-toend testing approach for interoperability tests that involve multiple standards/domains. The development includes activities such as developing use cases for such test scenarios.</p><p>o This activity is anticipated to be ongoing through 2012 as the new working group compiles, discusses, and agrees on critical use cases that require SGIP implementation support to help achieve end-to-end interoperability.</p><p>• Performing outreach, marketing, and education-The SGTCC will make efforts in building awareness for end users, advocating that end users use IPRM conformance in their purchasing specifications.</p><p>o This activity is an ongoing effort, including the development of market-facing information on testing and certification considerations, as well as SGTCC recommendations and communication with industry stakeholders on the details of these issues via workshops, white papers, and conference presentations.</p><p>• Collaborating with the Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) on security testing: Cybersecurity is one area that affects all Smart Grid standards and crosses all domains.</p><p>The SGTCC has establishes a liaison relationship to work with a CSWG subgroup on testing and certification in addressing cybersecurity-related testing.</p><p>o This activity enhances the existing work products of the SGTCC to provide more targeted best practices for testing on cybersecurity issues. Work accomplished to date includes the development of an expanded section on cybersecurity testing that was incorporated into the second release of the IPRM.</p><p>• Provide ongoing support to ITCAs by SGTCC members: The SGTCC plans to provide continued support to ITCAs to comply with requirements specified in the IPRM and to assist in resolving any specific issues in their implementation of the conformance and interoperability testing and certification programs.</p><p>o This activity is ongoing, with the SGTCC supporting ITCAs as they proceed in implementing recommended practices.</p><p>• Preparing for the transition: The SGTCC is currently collaborating with the ITCAs and those industry accreditation organizations that will support labs and certification bodies who are supporting ITCA implementation of the IPRM. A first joint meeting between these organizations is being planned for the first half of 2012 to develop a dialogue between these participants and to identify actions needed to accelerate IPRM implementation. The SGTCC IPRM Implementation Working Group is developing initial guidance material on the SGIP Web site, and continuing discussion with both ITCAs and accrediting organizations to better understand the tools and processes that will help accelerate implementation of these assessments.</p><p>o This activity will be a continuing focus in 2012 and beyond.</p><p>• Prioritizing Test Program Needs: The SGTCC is focused on identifying gaps in available test programs associated with the NIST list of priority standards for Smart Grid interoperability. Through stakeholder input, the SGTCC will endeavor to develop a set of priority program needs, and will support and help facilitate the establishment of industry programs that address the identified gaps.</p><p>o This activity will be a focus area during 2012.</p><p>The SGIP's SGTCC has made significant progress in its first two years of activity, establishing the basic infrastructure of a testing and certification framework in accordance with the goals of Phase III of the NIST plan in accelerating interoperable Smart Grid standards. The SGTCC is transitioning towards increased involvement in the implementation activities associated with the framework. The success of broader industry implementation of testing and certification programs will require industry recognition and acceptance of the value of these programs, active stakeholder participation in demonstrating interoperability through test programs, and the integration by end users of these test programs to support their technology selection and deployment initiatives.</p><p>Developing and implementing a framework for testing and certification of Smart Grid interoperability standards is a long-term process. NIST plans to continue working with SGIP, the SGTCC, and industry stakeholders in refining the framework and providing necessary support for its implementation.</p><p>coordinated process for guidance on Smart Grid standards. NIST supported the Commission's order, which notes that "In its comments, NIST suggests that the Commission could send appropriate signals to the marketplace by recommending use of the NIST Framework without mandating compliance with particular standards. NIST adds that it would be impractical and unnecessary for the Commission to adopt individual interoperability standards." <ref type="bibr">143</ref> Although the NIST framework and roadmap effort is the product of federal legislation, broad engagement of Smart Grid stakeholders at the state and local levels is essential to ensure the consistent voluntary application of the standards being developed. Currently, many states and their utility commissions are pursuing Smart Grid-related projects. Ultimately, state and local projects will converge into fully functioning elements of the Smart Grid "system of systems." Therefore, the interoperability and cybersecurity standards developed under the NIST framework and roadmap must support the role of the states in modernizing the nation's electric grid. The NIST framework can provide a valuable input to regulators as they consider the prudency of investments proposed by utilities.</p><p>A key objective of the NIST work is to create a self-sustaining, ongoing standards process that supports continuous innovation as grid modernization continues in the decades to come. <ref type="bibr">144</ref> NIST envisions that the processes being put in place by the SGIP, as they mature, will provide the mechanism to evolve the Smart Grid standards framework as new requirements and technologies emerge. The SGIP processes will also evolve and improve as experience is gained. Additional future activities of the SGIP are discussed in Section 5.8. Additionally, NIST has and will continue to provide technical contributions aligned with NIST's core measurements and standards missions that development of the Smart Grid. NIST leadership on these committees and working groups, as well as its technical contributions provide strong support for the acceleration of the standards necessary for the safe, secure, and reliable Smart Grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Issues to be Addressed 8.1.</head><p>This section describes additional major standards-related issues and barriers affecting standardization efforts and progress toward a fully interoperable Smart Grid. The SGIP working groups are examining both short-and long-term issues. The Priority Action Plans (PAPs) have a short-term focus, and it is expected that the SGIP activities in the areas described below will result in new PAPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.1.">Electromagnetic Disturbances and Interference</head><p>The foundation for the new Smart Grid is built on increasingly sophisticated sensing and control of all aspects of the grid. The expected rise in the use of distributed renewable energy sources, plug-in electric vehicles and smart appliances in the home, wired and wireless communications, and other "smart" systems throughout the grid, along with the increasing electromagnetic sources in the general environment, will result in unprecedented exposure to possible electromagnetic disturbances and interference. These "smart" systems are being deployed throughout the power grid in locations ranging from single-family homes to complex industrial facilities. These environments will require a broad array of measures to protect the grid and other electronic systems from interference.</p><p>The possible interference phenomena include common events such as switching and fast transients, electrostatic discharge, lightning bursts, radio frequency interference, as well as infrequent, but potentially catastrophic, events such as severe geomagnetic storms and Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI) threats from a range of narrowband and broadband sources, with interference both conducted and radiated. Intense electromagnetic fields can be generated by a repeatable (non-explosive) high-power generator, which are directed to the target by an antenna, or High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP). The Congressional Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Commission has `documented some of the more severe electromagnetic-disturbance-based risks and threats to critical U.S. national infrastructures, including the electric power grid upon which other infrastructures depend. <ref type="bibr">145</ref> These threats and their potential impacts provide impetus to evaluate, prioritize, and protect/harden the new Smart Grid.</p><p>The term "electromagnetic compatibility" (EMC) describes the ability to withstand electromagnetic interference and function properly in a given environment. EMC within the Smart Grid systems and in the external environment, along with immunity to serious natural and man-made threats, must be systematically addressed for reliable operation of the Smart Grid. Also, immunity to interference, coexistence with other devices, and fault tolerance should be considered early in the design of Smart Grid systems to avoid costly remedies and redesigns after the systems are widely deployed.</p><p>Standards and testing criteria for electromagnetic compatibility, coexistence, and immunity to serious electromagnetic disturbances should be specified as appropriate for components and systems in the Smart Grid. Because the Smart Grid components are so diverse, there is not a onesize-fits-all solution. Therefore, a range of standards or recommendations specific to particular environments or devices is anticipated. The criteria for smart appliances in the home will be quite different from systems located in substations or industrial facilities. Many of the EMC specifications and requirements already exist in various standards. The task ahead is to identify appropriate existing standards that are, or should be, applied to the Smart Grid and to identify potential areas that need standards development.</p><p>The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Governing Board (SGIPGB) has recognized this situation and chartered a Domain Expert Working Group (DEWG) to "investigate enhancing the immunity of Smart Grid devices and systems to the detrimental effects of natural and man-made electromagnetic interference, both radiated and conducted. The focus is to address these EMC issues and to develop recommendations for the application of standards and testing criteria to ensure EMC for the Smart Grid, with a particular focus on issues directly related to interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems, including impacts, avoidance, generation, and mitigation of and immunity to electromagnetic interference." (Electromagnetic Interoperability Issues Working Group (EMII WG) Charter<ref type="foot" target="#foot_67">foot_67</ref> ). The primary goal of the working group is to identify and focus on the critical parts of the Smart Grid and develop a strategy to implement effective EMC, including standards, testing, and conformity assessment, with particular focus on issues directly affecting interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems. This strategy should provide for growth and change as the Smart Grid evolves. The EMII WG's approach will be to work with power industry and EMC experts, SDOs, and other stakeholders, in addition to the SGIP's Priority Action Plans (PAPs) and working groups, to identify, evaluate, and/or initiate development of the appropriate EMC standards and testing criteria to ensure interoperability of the various Smart Grid devices and systems. The Home-to-Grid (H2G) DEWG has submitted a white paper, "Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Issues for Home-to-Grid Devices, which has been adopted by the EMII WG.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_68">foot_68</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.2.">Reliability, Implementability, and Safety of Framework Standards</head><p>Implementability covers a number of key issues, such as the following:</p><p>• whether each proposed interoperability standard would enhance functionality of the development of Smart Grid technologies;</p><p>• what the impacts on consumers are;</p><p>• what potential impacts on the electric industry are;</p><p>• whether the standard/protocol pertains to interoperability and functionality of the implementations of these standards and protocols; and</p><p>• whether the standard is ready to be implemented by utilities.</p><p>In addition, implementability addresses impacts on consumers, as well as potential impacts upon the electric industry associated with implementing Smart Grid standards and protocols.</p><p>At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Technical Conference on Smart Grid Interoperability Standards held in January 2011<ref type="foot" target="#foot_69">foot_69</ref> and in subsequent filings, concerns were expressed by presenters at the meeting and in comments submitted to FERC regarding how new standards and technologies will impact the reliability and security of the national power grid.</p><p>Additionally, concerns about the maturity of implementations and maturity of the underlying technologies used in a particular standard were also raised, including legacy issues. The standards information forms and posted narratives described in Chapter 4 contain some of the information regarding maturity of the standards and implementations, as well as the FERCapproved North American Energy Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability standards that may be impacted by adoption of the standards, but formal reviews related to the reliability and implementability issues were not part of the original NIST or SGIP Catalog of Standards processes. During the evolution of the legacy grid to the Smart Grid, the introduction of new standards and technologies may pose implementation and transition challenges as well as possibly affect the reliability and safety of the grid.</p><p>Safety should be a key attribute of Smart Grid technology as it is integrated into the electrical infrastructure. Electric and communications Utility installations have used the National Electrical Safety Code® (ANSI C2) as the rules for the practical safeguarding of persons for utility and communications installation since 1913. The code was originally sponsored by the National Bureau of Standards. Since 1973, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has been the administrative secretariat. New editions are published every five years.</p><p>In the customer domain, electrical installations are governed by the National Electrical Code® (NEC®) (ANSI/NFPA70). First published in 1897, the National Electrical Code® is adopted at the state or local level in all 50 states and in many other countries. The code is intended to protect persons and property from hazards arising from the use of electricity. The installation requirements of the code are enforced by government or private electrical inspectors or building officials. A companion standard, Electrical Safety in the Workplace (ANSI/NFPA70E), provides requirements for workers who may be exposed to electrical hazards. Both the NEC and NFPA 70E have three-year revision cycles.</p><p>Because the NEC is an important element in the safe implementation of smart grid technology in new as well as existing installations, NIST funded a research project through the Fire Protection Research Foundation to study the impact of Smart Grid on the electrical infrastructure in the customer domain. Researchers from California Polytechnic State University studied customer domain requirements along with the impacts of energy management and emerging alternative energy technologies. Their findings are covered by a report of the research entitled "Smart Grid and NFPA Electrical Safety Codes and Standards"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_70">foot_70</ref> . This report is being used as a basis for smart grid related changes for the 2014 edition of the NEC.</p><p>The SGIP is now considering the addition of reviews for reliability, implementability, and safety considerations to the Catalog of Standards process described in Sections 4.5 and 5.3. New working groups that would conduct these reviews would analyze candidate standards for:</p><p>• Potential for unintended consequences for existing protection and control schemes, and other market or grid operational systems;</p><p>• Potential impacts of complexities introduced into the electric system and market management complexities;</p><p>• Possible reliability enhancements by utilizing the capabilities of the candidate standard; and</p><p>• Impacts of the candidate standard on the safety of the electrical grid.</p><p>In addition, depending on the existing legacy technologies and processes, there are various implementation and migration challenges present in adopting new standards and integrating their implementations with legacy technologies. Regulatory commissions, utilities, and others will consider implementation factors, such as sufficient maturity of a standard as demonstrated in standards-compliant commercially available products, effective technology transition plans to maintain reliable operations, and cost-effective deployment. To address some of these issues, , the SGIP created the Implementation Methods Committee (IMC), whose mission is to identify, develop and support mechanisms and tools for objective standards impact assessment, transition management and technology transfer in order to assist in deployment of standards based Smart Grid devices, systems and infrastructure (see Section 5.8.2).</p><p>Presently the SGIP provides a means of addressing such issues, upon identification by an industry participant, by assigning resolution to an existing working group or forming a new PAP to scope out the resolution. An example of this is PAP18, which was formed to address the issue of Smart Energy Profile (SEP) 1.x migration to SEP 2.0. The SGIP is now considering alternatives to this approach, such as creating a new review process within the Catalog of Standards process to assess implementation considerations and prepare guidance for each new standard proposed or included in the Catalog of Standards. This review would analyze the issues involved in implementation of new standards potentially including:</p><p>• Technology transition risks and any potential stranded equipment implications;</p><p>• Business process changes required ;</p><p>• Relative implementation maturity of the standard and related implementation consideration;</p><p>• Cost drivers that facilitate evaluation of relative cost-effectiveness of alternate solutions; and</p><p>• Applicable federal and state policy considerations related to standards implementation.</p><p>These additional reliability, implementability and safety reviews would be included in the SGIP Catalog of Standards process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion 8.2.</head><p>As the SGIP progresses in its work to identify and address additional standards gaps and provide ongoing coordination to accelerate the development of Smart Grid standards, NIST will continue to publish Interoperability Framework updates as needed. As of January 2012, six PAPs (0, 1, 4, 10, 11, and 18) have completed their work, and further work has been identified by the SGIP. There are continued opportunities for participation by new Smart Grid community members in the overall NIST process, including within the SGIP and its committees and working groups. Details about future meetings, workshops, and public comment opportunities will appear on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_71">foot_71</ref>   The conceptual model consists of several domains, each of which contains many applications and actors that are connected by associations, through interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Appendix: List of Acronyms</head><p>• Actors may be devices, computer systems, or software programs and/or the organizations that own them. Actors have the capability to make decisions and exchange information with other actors through interfaces.</p><p>• Applications are the tasks performed by the actors within the domains. Some applications are performed by a single actor, others by several actors working together.</p><p>• Domains group actors to discover the commonalities that will define the interfaces. In general, actors in the same domain have similar objectives. Communications within the same domain may have similar characteristics and requirements. Domains may contain other domains.</p><p>• Associations are logical connections between actors that establish bilateral relationships. Actors interact with associated actors through interfaces. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-1, the electrical associations between domains are shown as dashed lines, and the communications associations are shown as solid lines.</p><p>• Interfaces represent the point of access between domains. Communications interfaces are at each end of the communication associations and represent the access point for information to enter and exit a domain (interfaces are logical). Interfaces show either electrical connections or communications connections. Each of these interfaces may be bidirectional. Communications interfaces represent an information exchange between two domains and the actors within; they do not represent physical connections. They represent logical connections in the Smart Grid information network interconnecting various domains (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>-3).</p><p>There are seven domains represented within the Smart Grid system, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">10</ref>-1. These represent logical domains based on the present and near-term view of the grid. In the future, some of the domains may combine (such as transmission and distribution), and others may shrink in importance (perhaps bulk generation becomes less important as micro-generators become more prevalent).</p><p>NOTE TO READER: The tables, figures, and discussion in this chapter are essentially the same as the tables, figures, and discussion in Release 1.0, Chapter 9. A few grammatical and other editorial changes have been made, but the basic content has not been changed. (The one contentrelated change is the addition of "Emerging Markets" to Table 10-3.) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Customer</head><p>The end users of electricity. May also generate, store, and manage the use of energy. Traditionally, three customer types are discussed, each with its own sub-domain: home, commercial/building, and industrial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Markets</head><p>The operators and participants in electricity markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service Provider</head><p>The organizations providing services to electrical customers and to utilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operations</head><p>The managers of the movement of electricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bulk Generation</head><p>The generators of electricity in bulk quantities. May also store energy for later distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transmission</head><p>The carriers of bulk electricity over long distances. May also store and generate electricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>The distributors of electricity to and from customers. May also store and generate electricity.</p><p>It is important to note that domains are NOT organizations. For instance, an Independent Systems Operator (ISO) or Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) may have actors in both the Markets and Operations domains. Similarly, a distribution utility is not entirely contained within the Distribution domain-it is likely to also contain actors in the Operations domain, such as a Distribution Management System (DMS), and in the Customer domain, such as meters. The Smart Grid Domain Diagrams are presented at two levels of increasing detail, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref>-1. Users of the model are encouraged to create additional levels or identify particular actors at a particular level in order to discuss the interaction between parts of the Smart Grid. The purpose of the domain diagram is to provide a framework for discussing both the existing power system and the evolving Smart Grid. While Chapter 3 shows domain interactions and overall scope, the following sections describe the details of the specific domains. Note that the domain diagrams, as presented, are not intended to be comprehensive in identifying all actors and all paths possible in the Smart Grid. This achievement will only be possible after additional elaboration and consolidation of use cases are achieved by stakeholder activities that are ongoing.</p><p>It is important to note that the domain diagram (or the conceptual model) of the Smart Grid is not limited to a single domain, single application, or single use case. For example, the use of "Smart Grid" in some discussions has been applied to only distribution automation or in other discussions to only advanced metering or demand response. The conceptual model assumes that "Smart Grid" includes a wide variety of use cases and applications, especially (but not limited to) functional priorities and cross-cutting requirements identified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The scope also includes other cross-cutting requirements including data management and application integration, as described in the GridWise Architecture Council Interoperability Context-Setting Framework. <ref type="bibr">151</ref> devices and systems within the customer premises, either directly or via a Home Area Network (HAN) or other Local Area Network (LAN).</p><p>There may be more than one EMS-and therefore more than one communications path-per customer. An EMS may be an entry point for such applications as remote load control, monitoring and control of distributed generation, in-home display of customer usage, reading of non-energy meters, and integration with building management systems and the enterprise. The EMS may provide auditing/logging for cybersecurity purposes. The Customer domain is electrically connected to the Distribution domain. It communicates with the Distribution, Operations, Market, and Service Provider domains. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Markets Domain 10.3.</head><p>The markets are where grid assets are bought and sold. Markets yet to be created may be instrumental in defining the Smart Grid of the future. Actors in the Markets domain exchange price and balance supply and demand within the power system (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10-3</ref>). The boundaries of the Markets domain include the edge of the Operations domain where control happens, the domains supplying assets (e.g., Generation, Transmission, etc.), and the Customer domain. standards consider suppliers of more than 300 megawatts to be Bulk Generation; most DER is smaller and is typically served through aggregators. DER participates in markets to some extent today, and will participate to a greater extent as the Smart Grid becomes more interactive.</p><p>Communications for Markets domain interactions must be reliable, traceable, and auditable. Also, these communications must support e-commerce standards for integrity and nonrepudiation. As the percentage of energy supplied by small DER increases, the allowed latency in communications with these resources must be reduced.</p><p>The high-priority challenges in the Markets domain are: extending price and DER signals to each of the Customer sub-domains; simplifying market rules; expanding the capabilities of aggregators; ensuring interoperability across all providers and consumers of market information; managing the growth (and regulation) of retailing and wholesaling of energy; and evolving communication mechanisms for prices and energy characteristics between and throughout the Markets and Customer domains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retailing</head><p>Retailers sell power to end-customers and may in the future aggregate or broker DER between customers or into the market.</p><p>Most are connected to a trading organization to allow participation in the wholesale market.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ancillary Operations</head><p>Ancillary operations provide a market to provide frequency support, voltage support, spinning reserve, and other ancillary services as defined by FERC, NERC, and the various ISOs. These markets normally function on a regional or ISO basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service Provider Domain 10.4.</head><p>Actors in the Service Provider domain perform services to support the business processes of power system producers, distributors, and customers (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10-4</ref>). These business processes range from traditional utility services, such as billing and customer account management, to enhanced customer services, such as management of energy use and home energy generation. Representative applications within the Operations domain are described in Table 10-5. These applications are derived from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61968-1 Interface Reference Model (IRM) for this domain. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control</head><p>Network control is coordinated by actors in this domain, although they may only supervise wide area, substation, and local automatic or manual control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fault Management</head><p>Fault Management actors enhance the speed at which faults can be located, identified, and sectionalized, and the speed at which service can be restored. They provide information for customers, coordinate with workforce dispatch, and compile information for statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Operation Feedback Analysis actors compare records taken from real-time operation related with information on network incidents, connectivity, and loading to optimize periodic maintenance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculations</head><p>Real-time Network Calculations actors (not shown) provide system operators with the ability to assess the reliability and security of the power system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Training</head><p>Dispatcher Training actors (not shown) provide facilities for dispatchers that simulate the actual system they will be using.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Records and Assets</head><p>The Records and Asset Management actors track and report on the substation and network equipment inventory, provide geospatial data and geographic displays, maintain records on non-electrical assets, and perform asset-investment planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operation Planning</head><p>Operational Planning and Optimization actors perform simulation of network operations, schedule switching actions, dispatch repair crews, inform affected customers, and schedule the importing of power. They keep the cost of imported power low through peak generation, switching, load shedding, or demand response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance and Construction</head><p>Maintenance and Construction actors coordinate inspection, cleaning, and adjustment of equipment; organize construction and New requirements for the Bulk Generation domain may include controls for greenhouse gas emissions, increases in renewable energy sources, and provision of storage to manage the variability of renewable generation. Actors in the Bulk Generation domain may include various devices, such as protection relays, remote terminal units, equipment monitors, fault recorders, user interfaces, and programmable logic controllers. In the Smart Grid, the Distribution domain will communicate more closely with the Operations domain in real-time to manage the power flows associated with a more dynamic Markets domain and other environmental and security-based factors. The Markets domain will communicate with the Distribution domain in ways that will affect localized consumption and generation. In turn, these behavioral changes due to market forces may have electrical and structural impacts on the Distribution domain and the larger grid. Under some models, third-party customer service providers may communicate with the Customer domain using the infrastructure of the Distribution domain, which would change the communications infrastructure selected for use within the Domain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>9</head><label></label><figDesc>Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 [Public Law No: 110-140], Sec. 1305. 10 http://ferc.gov/EventCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?ID=5571&amp;CalType=%20&amp;CalendarID=116&amp;Date=01/31/2011&amp;View=Listview.</figDesc></figure>

Among those standards added to Table 4-2 are standards now under development in the PAPs, such as Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Energy Interoperation (EI).Because the Smart Grid is evolving from the existing power grid, NIST has also included standards that support widely deployed legacy systems. Priority Action Plans have been established with the goal of resolving interoperability issues between the standards for legacy equipment and other standards identified for the Smart Grid. For example, PAP12 82 seeks to enable implementations of the Distributed Network Protocol, DNP3 as specified in IEEE 1815, to work with implementations of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850 standard. In addition to the major principles, desirable and nonexclusive guiding principles used in the selection of standards for the framework are given in the inset frames in this section, entitled "Guiding Principles for Identifying Standards for Implementation." NIST used the criteria listed in these inset frames to evaluate standards, specifications, requirements, and guidelines for inclusion in the initial and the current version (Release 2.Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities,83  where such standards are defined as developed and adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.

This set of criteria is extensive, and the complete list does not apply to each standard, specification, or guideline listed in Table</p>4</p>-1 and Table</p>4</p>-2. Judgments as to whether each item merits inclusion is made on the basis of combinations of relevant criteria.</p>The items included in Table</p>4</p>-1 are, in most cases, voluntary consensus standards developed and maintained by ANSI-accredited and other standards development organizations (SDOs). The phrases "standards-or specification-setting organizations (SSOs)" and "SDOs" are used loosely and interchangeably within the standards-related literature. However, for the purpose of this document, NIST is using the term "SSOs" to define the broader universe of organizations and groups-formal or informal-that develop standards, specifications, user requirements, guidelines, etc. The term "SDOs" is used to define standards development organizations that develop standards in processes marked by openness, balance, and transparency, and characterized by due process to address negative comments. NIST uses the two terms, SSOs and SDOs, to address the wide variations in types of organizations that are developing standards, specifications, user guidelines, and other input, which are then being identified and considered for use in the Smart Grid framework. Also, in this document, NIST uses the definition of voluntary consensus standards from Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119, 82 http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/PAP12DNP361850.</p>83  </p>OMB Circular A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities, February 10, 1998, http://standards.gov/a119.cfm.</p></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Interoperability Knowledge Base and the NIST Smart 5.7. Grid Collaboration Site</head><p>All SGIP outputs are available to the public through the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site 106 (also referred to as "the wiki" or "the Twiki") and through the Interoperability Knowledge Base (IKB) web site 107 . The wiki site allows for interactive communication of information among stakeholders and other interested parties. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Progress to Date 6.3.</head><p>Since early 2009, the working group has been actively addressing the cybersecurity needs of the Smart Grid. This section describes three major work efforts that the working group has completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1.">Release of National Institute of Standards and Technology Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7628</head><p>The first draft of NISTIR 7628 was released in September 2009. The preliminary report distills use cases collected to date, requirements and vulnerability classes identified in other relevant cybersecurity assessments and scoping documents, as well as other information necessary for specifying and tailoring security requirements to provide adequate protection for the Smart Grid.</p><p>The NISTIR 7628 second draft was released in February 2010 and contains sections on the overall security strategy for the Smart Grid, updated logical interface diagrams, privacy, bottomup analysis, and vulnerability class analysis sections. New chapters on research and development themes, the standards assessment process, and a functional logical Smart Grid architecture are also included.</p><p>The NISTIR 7628 v1.0, 110 released in August 2010, addresses documented comments submitted on the second draft and includes chapter updates. The new content contains basic information on security architecture and a section on cryptography and key management. The responses to the comments received on the second draft of the NISTIR were also posted on a CSWG Web site. <ref type="bibr">111</ref> An introduction to the NISTIR 7628, 112 released in September 2010, provides a high-level summary of the three-volume report, and serves as an introduction and background to the technical report. This document was written for an audience that is not familiar with cybersecurity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">Standards Reviews</head><p>The Standards subgroup assesses standards and related documents with respect to the cybersecurity and privacy requirements from NISTIR 7628. These assessments are performed on the standards contained in the Framework or on PAP recommendations in final process. During these assessments, the subgroup determines if a document does or should contain privacy or cybersecurity requirements, correlates those requirements with the cybersecurity requirements found in NISTIR 7628, and identifies any gaps. Finally, recommendations are made for further work needed on the reviewed documents to mitigate any gaps. Standards listed in the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS) have a 30-day public review process.</p><p>To date, the Standards subgroup has produced detailed reports that contain analysis and recommendations for improvements in the following standards: • IEC 61970: Energy Management System Application Program Interface (EMS-API) (also referred to as the "Common Information Model for Wires Models");</p><p>• IEC 62351: Power Systems Management and Associated Information Exchange -Data and Communications Security, Parts 1 through 7;</p><p>• North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) Energy Usage Information;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.3.">Smart Grid Cybersecurity Test Guidance</head><p>The CSWG continues to expand coordination with the SGTCC to develop guidance and recommendations on Smart Grid conformance, interoperability, and cybersecurity testing. The guidance and processes developed apply to the utility sector laboratories and utilities conducting cybersecurity and/or interoperability testing to evaluate Smart Grid systems, subsystems, and components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.4.">NISTIR 7628 Updates</head><p>As threats and risks change, as SSOs create new and update existing standards, and as regulatory bodies create new and update existing regulations relative to the electric sector, the CSWG will review and assess how these changes should be reflected in NISTIR 7628. Depending upon the topic discussed, new CSWG subgroups and NISTIR 7628 document sections may be created. The CSWG will review NISTIR 7628 approximately every 18 months. The topics under consideration for a future update of NISTIR 7628 include:</p><p>• Creating a matrix of privacy concerns in multiple settings and expanding the section on the Smart Grid impact on privacy concerns;</p><p>• Initiating a task within the SGIP SGAC to ensure the conceptual security architecture is harmonized with the SGAC conceptual architecture during its development; and</p><p>• Adding additional high-level cybersecurity requirements that are identified during the standards reviews and supplemental work that the subgroups undertake. The list of potential new cybersecurity requirements resides on the NIST Smart Grid Collaboration Site. <ref type="bibr">119</ref> CSWG members are encouraged to periodically review and provide comment and feedback on the list to the High-Level Security Requirements subgroup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.5.">Outreach and Education</head><p>The CSWG will meet with asset owners, private sector companies, specific regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders to provide explanatory information about uses and applications for NISTIR 7628. The CSWG has established outreach and education activities with private companies, academia, and public utility commissions (PUCs). Meetings have been held with the PUCs in California, Ohio, Texas, and Colorado. <ref type="bibr">120</ref> The CSWG outreach activities will continue, and as new guidelines are developed, the outreach briefing material will be updated. CSWG management, as well as subgroup leads, frequently </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment Results</head><p>The study resulted in several findings of major gaps in existing conformity testing programs. The results of the study show that: 127</p><p>• Only about one-third of the evaluated standards have a testing program at all. A few more than that had written test procedures, but no formal testing program;</p><p>• About the same number, one-third, have a users group or other means for providing feedback on the standard, updating it, and asking questions about conformity;</p><p>• Almost all of the available testing programs are for conformity to the standard only; they do not test for interoperability between systems;</p><p>• Only a few of the programs test security of communications; and</p><p>• Several of the standards are either too vague to be effectively tested or are catalogs or guidelines that were never intended to be tested.</p><p>The gaps uncovered in this study show the urgent and important need for developing and implementing an interoperability testing and certification framework to provide a comprehensive approach to close these gaps and to accelerate the development and implementation of industry programs that enable Smart Grid interoperability. NIST and the SGTCC have used the insights resulting from the study to direct subsequent interoperability testing and certification framework development efforts.</p><p>As implementation of the testing and certification framework moves forward, NIST and the SGTCC will review and revise the program landscape document to assess industry progress in program development and use those findings to further guide priority issues for the SGTCC to address.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2.">High-Level Framework Development Guide</head><p>In addition to the assessment of existing testing and certification programs, a development guide <ref type="bibr">128</ref> was produced to accelerate the development of a comprehensive operational framework. The goal of the framework is to present a comprehensive approach to help close the gaps</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Processes and Tools</head><p>The framework development guide emphasizes the importance of establishing common processes and test tools to help ensure consistency and repeatability of test results. A number of terms and variants are used in commonly describing these test tools, such as "common test harness," "golden reference test equipment," and "golden reference test products." Generally, these terms represent test tools available to a test lab or end user to provide a consistent baseline test either as a stand-alone implementation or in concert with the many other types of test tools available.</p><p>A "common test harness" is essentially an automated software-based test tool that is designed to test a particular system under sets of specified conditions. Using such a tool, to provide consistency, comparative results can be generated, and the effects of changes in the system under test can be evaluated. "Golden reference test equipment" often refers to test tools that can be configured in a laboratory to provide a constant ("reference") such that there is assurance that changes to the products making up a system under test or configuration variants are consistently tested in the same manner, Testing and certification programs supporting Smart Grid interoperability are anticipated to take place across multiple test facilities. The SGTCC has cited the importance of implementing processes and test tools to provide confidence to end users, assuring that test data and measurements are generated using a common known reference to achieve repeatable results regardless of location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SGTCC Framework Development Activities 7.2.</head><p>The SGTCC is charged with the development of the operational framework and action plan for Smart Grid interoperability testing and certification. Since its establishment, SGTCC has undertaken a number of activities in the framework development process. The action plan of the SGTCC is included in a "Testing &amp; Certification Roadmap" 130 document, which describes the plans and deliverables to be developed through the SGTCC. It is a living document that evolves through close collaboration with industry stakeholders to ensure that identified issues and needs in framework development and implementation are addressed by the SGTCC. The SGTCC's mission is "to coordinate creation of documentation and organizational frameworks relating to compliance testing and certification to Smart Grid interoperability and cybersecurity standards." <ref type="bibr">131</ref> The SGTCC's objectives include "the development of an action plan, with the support of relevant parties, to establish a standardized framework (e.g., tools, materials, components, and examples) that can be used by those performing testing for and certification of compliance with interoperability and cybersecurity standards." 132 130 <ref type="url" target="http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/SGTCCRoadMap">http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/SGTCCRoadMap</ref>. <ref type="bibr">131</ref> Ibid. <ref type="bibr">132</ref> Ibid. moved slowly from standards release to market did not." 134 SGTCC believes that "the formation and maintenance of this organization, ad hoc or formal, is key to increasing the velocity of the adoptions of interoperable standards in the marketplace." <ref type="bibr">135</ref> Recognizing this, the Interoperability Process Reference Manual (IPRM) was developed for adoption by ITCAs. The IPRM outlines the roles and requirements of an ITCA and specifies the mandatory testing and certification processes associated with achieving interoperability for a specific standard. The IPRM also includes the recommended best practices for interoperability test constructs.</p><p>The IPRM is intended to be adopted by any ITCA that is responsible for coordinating testing and certification on a Smart Grid technology standard and driving adoption of the technology within the industry. The SGTCC has concluded that those organizations that incorporate the IPRM guidelines into their conformity testing programs will have a greater opportunity to ensure the products' interoperability.</p><p>As stated in the IPRM, once an ITCA is in place, "The ITCA shall provide governance and coordination for the maintenance and administration of Interoperability Testing Laboratories and Certification Bodies in cooperation with the relevant SSOs and user groups." <ref type="bibr">136</ref> The roles and requirements of an ITCA, and the best practices described in the IPRM, are summarized in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Roles and Requirements of an ITCA</head><p>The role of an ITCA is to provide governance and coordination for the maintenance and administration of Interoperability Testing Laboratories and Certification Bodies in cooperation with the relevant SSOs and user groups. It manages the end-to-end processes associated with interoperability testing and certification with appropriate infrastructure in place to support this function.</p><p>The requirements for an ITCA as specified in the IPRM are divided into the following five categories:</p><p>• Governance defines the structures, policies, rules, and regulations associated with the ITCA certification program. A governance process example would require the ITCA to establish and maintain an independent and vendor-neutral testing and certification oversight authority. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Next Steps</head><p>The execution of the Priority Action Plans presently under way will continue until their objectives to fill identified gaps in the standards portfolio have been accomplished. As new gaps and requirements are identified, the SGIP will continue to initiate Priority Action Plans to address them. NIST and the SGIP will work with SSOs and other stakeholders to fill the gaps and improve the standards that form the foundation of the Smart Grid.</p><p>Work on the SGIP Catalog of Standards will continue to fully populate the Catalog and ensure robust architectural and cybersecurity reviews of the standards. The cybersecurity guidelines will be kept up to date to stay ahead of emerging new threats. Efforts will continue to partner with the private sector as it establishes testing and certification programs consistent with the SGIP testing and certification framework. Work will continue to coordinate with related international Smart Grid standards efforts to maintain U.S. leadership.</p><p>Many of the Department of Energy (DOE) Smart Grid Investment Grants will come to fruition in the near future. Principal investigators were required to include in their proposals a description of how the projects would support the NIST Framework. As the experiences with new Smart Grid technologies are gained from these projects, NIST will use these "lessons learned" to further identify the gaps and shortcomings of applicable standards.</p><p>NIST will continue to support the needs of regulators as they address standardization matters in the regulatory arena. Under EISA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is charged with instituting rulemaking proceedings to adopt the standards and protocols as may be necessary to ensure Smart Grid functionality and interoperability once, in FERC's judgment, the NIST-coordinated process has led to sufficient consensus. <ref type="bibr">138</ref> FERC obtained public input through two Technical Conferences on Smart Grid Interoperability Standards in November 2010 and January 2011, <ref type="bibr">139</ref> and through a supplemental notice requesting comments in February 2011. <ref type="bibr">140</ref> As a result, FERC issued an order in July 2011 141 stating that there was insufficient consensus for it to institute a rulemaking at that time to adopt the initial five families of standards identified by NIST as ready for consideration by regulators. <ref type="bibr">142</ref> In that July 2011 order, however, FERC expressed support for the NIST interoperability framework process, including the work done by the SGIP, for development of Smart Grid interoperability standards. The Commission's order stated that the NIST Framework is comprehensive and represents the best vehicle for developing standards for the Smart Grid. FERC's order also encourages stakeholders to actively participate and look to the NIST- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Customer Domain 10.2.</head><p>The customer is ultimately the stakeholder that the entire grid was created to support. This is the domain where electricity is consumed (see Figure <ref type="figure">10-2</ref>). Actors in the Customer domain enable customers to manage their energy usage and generation. Some actors also provide control and information flow between the customer and the other domains. The boundaries of the Customer domain are typically considered to be the utility meter and the Energy Services Interface (ESI). The ESI provides a secure interface for Utility-to-Consumer interactions. The ESI in turn can act as a bridge to facility-based systems, such as a Building Automation System (BAS) or a customer's Energy Management System (EMS). The service provider must not compromise the cybersecurity, reliability, stability, integrity, or safety of the electrical power network when delivering existing or emerging services.</p><p>The Service Provider domain shares interfaces with the Markets, Operations, and Customer domains. Communications with the Operations domain are critical for system control and situational awareness; communications with the Markets and Customer domains are critical for enabling economic growth through the development of "smart" services. For example, the Service Provider domain may provide the interface enabling the customer to interact with the market(s).</p><p>Service providers will create new and innovative services and products to meet the new requirements and opportunities presented by the evolving Smart Grid. Services may be performed by the electric service provider, by existing third parties, or by new participants drawn by new business models. Emerging services represent an area of significant new economic growth.</p><p>The priority challenge in the Service Provider domain is to develop the key interfaces and standards that will enable a dynamic market-driven ecosystem while protecting the critical power infrastructure. These interfaces must be able to operate over a variety of networking technologies while maintaining consistent messaging semantics. Some benefits to the Service Provider domain from the deployment of the Smart Grid include:</p><p>• The development of a growing market for third parties to provide value-added services and products to customers, utilities, and other stakeholders at competitive costs;</p><p>• The decrease in cost of business services for other Smart Grid domains; and</p><p>• A decrease in power consumption and an increase in power generation as customers become active participants in the power supply chain. Managing customer relationships by providing point-of-contact and resolution for customer issues and problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operations Domain 10.5.</head><p>Actors in the Operations domain are responsible for the smooth operation of the power system. Today, the majority of these functions are the responsibility of a regulated utility (see Figure <ref type="figure">10-5</ref>). The Smart Grid will enable more of these functions to be outsourced to service providers; others may evolve over time. No matter how the Service Provider and Markets domains evolve, there will still be basic functions needed for planning and operating the service delivery points of a "wires" company.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extension Planning</head><p>Network Extension planning actors develop long-term plans for power system reliability; monitor the cost, performance, and schedule of construction; and define projects to extend the network, such as new lines, feeders, or switchgear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Customer Support</head><p>Customer Support actors help customers to purchase, provision, install, and troubleshoot power system services. They also relay and record customer trouble reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bulk Generation Domain 10.6.</head><p>Applications in the Bulk Generation domain are the first processes in the delivery of electricity to customers (see Figure <ref type="figure">10-6</ref>). Electricity generation is the process of creating electricity from other forms of energy, which may include a wide variety of sources, including chemical combustion, nuclear fission, flowing water, wind, solar radiation, and geothermal heat. The boundary of the Bulk Generation domain is typically the Transmission domain. The Bulk Generation domain is electrically connected to the Transmission domain and shares interfaces with the Operations, Markets, and Transmission domains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control</head><p>Performed by actors that permit the Operations domain to manage the flow of power and reliability of the system. An example is the use of phase-angle regulators within a substation to control power flow between two adjacent power systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measure</head><p>Performed by actors that provide visibility into the flow of power and the condition of the systems in the field. In the future, measurement might be found built into meters, transformers, feeders, switches, and other devices in the grid.</p><p>An example is the digital and analog measurements collected through the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system from a remote terminal unit and provided to a grid control center in the Operations domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protect</head><p>Performed by actors that react rapidly to faults and other events in the system that might cause power outages, brownouts, or the destruction of equipment.</p><p>Performed to maintain high levels of reliability and power quality. May work locally or on a wide scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Record</head><p>Performed by actors that permit other domains to review what has happened on the grid for financial, engineering, operational, and forecasting purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asset Management</head><p>Performed by actors that work together to determine when equipment should have maintenance, calculate the life expectancy of the device, and record its history of operations and maintenance so it can be reviewed in the future for operational and engineering decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transmission Domain 10.7.</head><p>Transmission is the bulk transfer of electrical power from generation sources to distribution through multiple substations (see Figure <ref type="figure">10-7</ref>). A transmission network is typically operated by a Transmission-owning utility, Regional Transmission Operator or Independent System Operator (RTO/ISO), whose primary responsibility is to maintain stability on the electric grid by balancing generation (supply) with load (demand) across the transmission network. Examples of actors in the Transmission domain include remote terminal units, substation meters, protection relays, power quality monitors, phasor measurement units, sag monitors, fault recorders, and substation user interfaces.  <ref type="table">(Table 10-7</ref>). The Transmission domain may contain Distributed Energy Resources, such as electrical storage or peaking generation units.</p><p>Energy and supporting ancillary services (capacity that can be dispatched when needed) are procured through the Markets domain; scheduled and operated from the Operations domain; and finally delivered through the Transmission domain to the Distribution domain and ultimately to the Customer domain.</p><p>Most activity in the Transmission domain is in a substation. An electrical substation uses transformers to step up or step down voltage across the electric supply chain. Substations also contain switching, protection, and control equipment. Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>-7 depicts both step-up and step down substations connecting generation (including peaking units) and storage with distribution. Substations may also connect two or more transmission lines.</p><p>Transmission towers, power lines, and field telemetry (such as the line sag detector shown) make up the balance of the transmission network infrastructure. The transmission network is typically monitored and controlled through a SCADA system composed of a communication network, monitoring devices, and control devices. </p></div>

The electrical distribution system may be arranged in a variety of structures, including radial, looped, or meshed. The reliability of the distribution system varies depending on its structure, the types of actors that are deployed, and the degree to which they communicate with each other and with the actors in other domains. </p></div>

		<title level="a" type="main">Assessing the impact of coordinated cyber-physical attacks will require expertise in cybersecurity, physical security, and the electric infrastructure. The CSWG recognizes that collaboration is critical to effective identification of cyber and physical vulnerabilities and threats. During Fiscal Year (FY) 2012, the CSWG will actively pursue collaborations with other organizations already starting to address the combined cyber-physical attack vector. By providing critical cybersecurity expertise, the CSWG can identify this challenge and take steps to mitigate the potential impact these types of attacks could have on the Smart Grid</title>
