<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A conceptual model is used to support development and design within the area of systems and software modeling. The notion of validation refers to representing a domain in a model accurately and generating results using an executable model. In UML specifications, validation verifies the correctness of UML diagrams against any constraints and rules defined within the model. Currently, significant research has been conducted on generating test sets to validate that UML diagrams conform to requirements. UML activity diagrams are a specific focus of such efforts. An activity diagram is a flexible instrument for describing a system's behaviors and the internal logic of complex operations. This paper focuses on the notion of validation using activity diagrams and contrasts that process with a proposed method that involves an informal validation procedure. Accordingly, this informal validation involves comparing requirements to specifications expressed by a diagram of a modeling language called thinging machine (TM) modeling. The informal validation is a type of model checking that requires the model to be small enough for the verification to be done in a limited space or time period. In the proposed method, the model diagram is divided into subdiagrams to achieve this purpose. We claim the TM behavioral model comes with a particular dispositional structure that allows a designer to "carve" a model into smaller components for informal validation, which is shown through two case studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A conceptual model is a mathematical/logical/verbal representation (mimic) of a domain (real or proposed), situation, policy, or phenomenon developed for a particular study <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>[2] <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A conceptual (in contrast to an intentional mental representation such as sensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) model describes "how we conceive of that domain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is used to support development and design within the area of systems and software modeling (e.g., databases or business processes).</p><p>An example of such a model is a description developed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to construct a representation of a domain using primitive constructs and concepts such as the "lens" through which reality is perceived to capture that domain's meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Nonconceptual models such as mathematical models are presented in terms of variables and quantitative relationships (i.e., equations). By contrast, in conceptual models, the variables and relationships between variables are represented visually as a system of icons in a diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Visual representations can help to shift the focus to enhanced qualitative conceptual reasoning, serve as representations of an internal (mental) model, and provide a means for communication and analysis. In the context of conceptual modeling, to ensure a system's quality, it is critical that the model that represents the domain be semantically correct. This is confirmed by checking that the model satisfies some correctness properties and the system requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Validation</head><p>Validation is the process of confirming that models are understood, defined well, documented, and based on established fundamentals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It conveys a sense that "a scientific effort must be justified in some logical, objective, and algorithmic way" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, determining whether a particular model fulfills requirements by validating it over the complete domain of its intended applicability often is not possible (e.g., due to cost and time). Instead, tests and logical reasoning are conducted until adequate assurance is achieved that the model can be considered valid for its intended application.</p><p>Regarding UML, as a semi-informal notation, significant research efforts have gone into the so-called model-driven testing of UML diagrams. Such efforts mostly involve generating high-level test cases that can be used to validate both specifications and implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Specifically, activity diagrams are highly useful for validating requirements with customer representatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Activity diagrams have become an established modeling notation for various levels of abstraction, ranging from fine-grained descriptions of algorithms to high-level workflow models in business applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem: Semantics of the UML Diagram</head><p>According to Tariq, Sang, Gulzar, and Xiang <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the absence of formal semantics for UML activity diagrams makes it difficult to build automated tools for analyzing and validating such diagrams. Recently, UML 2.0 introduced token-driven semantics for activity diagrams inspired by Petri nets. One of the goals of the Foundational UML Subset (fUML <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) is to provide a well-defined execution of UML activity diagrams. Accordingly, additional validation tools are needed for diagrammatic representation in the context of conceptual modeling. This paper proposes such a tool using a new type of conceptual model. www.ijacsa.thesai.org</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Approach and Limitations</head><p>This paper focuses on works that solely examine the notion of validation using activity diagrams, as an example of the current state of research in the validation field. Validation of UML activity diagrams using directed test cases is very promising <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The present paper complements such studies by examining validation under "equivalent" representations using a diagrammatic model based on thinging machine (TM) modeling. The aim is to propose a particular technique for model validation based on TM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. REVIEW</head><p>An UML activity diagram is a semi-formal semantic specification that is intuitive and flexible. It is used to describe a system's behaviors and the internal logic of complex operations. Therefore, it is widely utilized as a front-end tool for system-level design of software and/or hardware systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Review: Graphs, Petri Nets, and Event B</head><p>The validation literature on developing test cases for activity diagrams is extensive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). According to Chen and Mishra <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, "Most directed test case generation work is performed by human intervention. Hand-written test cases entail laborious and time-consuming effort of verification engineers who have deep knowledge of the design. Due to the manual development, it is difficult to generate all directed test cases to achieve a coverage goal. The problem is further aggravated due to the lack of comprehensive functional coverage metrics." Many tools and methods have been developed to support test specifications and test case generation. For example, dSPACE developed a tool that uses activity diagrams for test descriptions and test script generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Chen, Poon, Tang, and Tse <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> presented a framework with which to construct test cases from specifications by identifying a set of input categories for the activity diagrams as test cases. Hettab, Kerkouche, and Chaoui <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> converted activity diagramming into grammar rules for graphs to capture all the relevant features for test case generation. Shirole, Kommuri, and Kumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> transformed activity diagrams into extended control flow graphs. Sunitha <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> incorporated Object Constraint Language (OCL) into activity diagramming for test case generation involving difficulties identifying complete behavior and static changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> matched Java program traces with behavior activity diagramming to identify changes resulting in a failure to identify static changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Sapna and Mohanty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> converted UML activity diagrams into tree structures to prioritize scenarios by assigning weights to nodes and edges; however, this approach lacks in-depth code coverage and cannot identify static changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Some authors have developed frameworks to transform a UML activity diagram into Petri nets automatically using a model checker for analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[21][22]</ref>). A different approach involves transforming UML activity diagrams into Event B to specify and verify the distributed and parallel workflow solicitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Approach in this Paper: Informal Validation</head><p>In our approach to validation, we first produce an equivalent TM representation of the activity diagram. We consider the complexity of the representation and thus aim for quick model checking by adopting informal reasoning. All of the reviewed validation methods discussed in the previous subsection can be applied to TM. Informal validation leads to discussing formal validation.</p><p>Formal specifications can be used to deliver a precise addition to different descriptions and can be validated, leading to specification faults being detected. Formal validation verifies the correctness of specifications, so it can be used to guarantee the quality of models (e.g., UML <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Despite the long interest in formal validation methods, "It seems that practitioners judge formal methods to be insufficiently beneficial to outweigh pragmatic problems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. According to Amey <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, "Customers are often 'aghast' at the idea of formal methods being used to develop their products and might say 'couldn't you use UML?'" Amey <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> suggests overcoming such prejudices through "formality by stealth" and cites semantically strengthened UML as an example <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, informal validation techniques rely on the opinions of modelers to draw a conclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. According to Petty <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, "Informal methods are more qualitative than quantitative and generally rely heavily on subjective human evaluation, rather than detailed mathematical analysis. Experts examine an artifact, for example, a conceptual model expressed as UML diagrams, and assess the model based on that examination and their reasoning and expertise." Examples of informal methods include inspection, face validation, the Turing test, desk checking, and walkthroughs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. According to Banks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, "In all cases though it is important to note that informal does not mean it is any less of a true testing method. These methods should be performed with the same discipline and structure that one would expect in 'formal' methods. When executed in such a way, solid conclusions can be made."</p><p>The purpose of informal validation is to examine the accuracy of a domain's representation in a conceptual model and in the results produced by the executable model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In this type of validation, the concept of a system is viewed as a group of interacting components, and its desired functionality is articulated by graphical means <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, in our proposed approach, the validation process involves requirements (e.g., expressed in English) versus specifications (expressed by TM diagrams). The validation here involves showing that the TM model is the correct model for the requirements. Thus, informal validation is a type of model checking that requires "the model to be small enough so that the verification can be done in a limited space or time" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Accordingly, the TM diagram is divided into subdiagrams for this purpose. Our claim is that the TM behavioral model comes with a particular dispositional structure that allows a designer to "carve" a diagram into smaller components for informal validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Outline</head><p>The next section reviews the basic constructs of a TM model. Section 4 presents a case study of validating the process of buying a beverage from a vending machine. Section 5 presents a second case study of validating an online shopping system. www.ijacsa.thesai.org III. THE THINGING MACHINE TM modeling is a way of understanding how things and processes have come to be structured (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and its TMrelated references by the author of the present paper). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1</ref>, a TM can be described as the following generic (basic) actions:</p><p>Arrive:</p><p>A thing moves to a machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accept:</head><p>A thing enters the machine. For simplification, we assume that all arriving things are accepted; hence, we can combine the arrive and accept stages into one stage: the receive stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Release:</head><p>A thing is ready for transfer outside the machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process:</head><p>A thing is changed, but no new thing results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Create:</head><p>A new thing is born in the machine.</p><p>Transfer:</p><p>A thing is input into or output from a machine.</p><p>Additionally, the TM model includes the mechanism of triggering (denoted by a dashed arrow in this study's figures), which initiates a flow from one machine to another. Multiple machines can interact with each other through the movement of things or triggering. Triggering is a transformation from one series of movements to another.</p><p>A Thinging-Machine Model.</p><p>IV. VALIDATING A VENDING MACHINE Sapna and Arunkumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> considered an example of an activity diagram for the process of buying a beverage from a vending machine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Vending Machine Beverage Found in Sapna and Arunkumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In this section, we first produce the corresponding TM models and then apply the validation strategy to this vendingmachine example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Static Model</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the corresponding static TM model. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>,  The user creates (circle 1) a drink selection that flows to the machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, where it is sent to a module that finds the (drink, price) record <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The drink data are found by extracting records (drink, price) (4) one by one and comparing the input drink with the drink data in the matching record.</p><p>-If the drink data inside the record are not equal to the input drink (5), then the next record is released from the set of records and processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to trigger the creation of drink data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Note that the drink item is created in the sense that it was not known to the machine as an independent thing before it was extracted from the record.</p><p>-If the drink data inside the record match the input drink <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, then this triggers processing of ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) the record to extract the price <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. (Note that, in the activity diagram, the price is a thing "dropped from the sky". There is no connection between the drink and its price.)</p><p> Meanwhile, the user inputs coins <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, which are processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> inside the machine to calculate their value <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. (Note that the activity diagram does not distinguish the coins as physical objects from their amount and value.) Then, the coins are stored in coin boxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</p><p> Both the amount ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and the price ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) flow to a module that compares them <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>-If the amount is equal to or greater than the price <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, then the drink is released to the user <ref type="bibr">(20 and 21)</ref>. Additionally, the coin storage is processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> to create change, which flows to the user <ref type="bibr">(23 and 24)</ref>.</p><p>-If the amount is less than the price <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, then a message is created and flows to the user (26 and 27).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Behavioral Model</head><p>To produce the TM behavioral model, we must identify all events in the vending-machine model. An event in TM modeling is formed from a subset of the static model in addition to a time subthimac. For example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the event the machine receives a drink selection.</p><p>Identifying a phenomenon's behavior involves dividing it into component parts and then fitting the behaviors of these parts into a whole. Accordingly, the static model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) can be divided into events as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, which shows only the regions of the events for simplification. The resulting list of events is as follows.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Validation Strategy</head><p>Until this point, we have focused only on the modeling notations. It is time to ask whether the vending-machine blueprint fulfills the requirements. Requirements typically are written in natural language, but the behavioral diagram provides a skeletal structure of events.</p><p>Plato famously employed the "carving" metaphor as an analogy for the reality of Forms (Phaedrus 265e): As if we were animals, the world comes to us predivided. Ideally, our best theories will be those that carve nature at its joints <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The behavioral model comes with a particular dispositional structure rooted in the five generic types of events: create, processes, release, transfer, and receive.</p><p>Validation in TM modeling refers to event validity, which involves the model's events being compared to those of the reality to determine whether they are similar. In TM modeling, a general approach to validating the developed model can be developed using a logical process in which one takes higherlevel events produced by the carving process and reduces them to the constituent events, which, in turn are based on generic events. This implies validating each generic action or sequence of these actions. However, because of space limitations and the informal nature of this study, we will not employ such a process but rather simply sketch operational descriptions of events with which to validate the model. This method assumes that the model's validity can be determined from observations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the decomposition of the behavioral model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>) into three parts (super-events), for which the joints suggest division among three super-events as follows.</p><p> Super-event 1: Selecting a drink and finding the price -The machine shall accept requests for n types of drinks.</p><p>-The machine determines the price of the selected drink.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the events involved: E1 through E9. The figure shows that the verification method involves feeding, internally, all drinks stored in the machine to the machine to verify that the machine performs the two requirements specified above. This verification process covers all legitimate inputs to E1. An actual verification system can be constructed to input the tuples to E1. www.ijacsa.thesai.org    -The machine calculates the digital values of these coins.</p><p>-The machine stores the coins in their appropriate places. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verification of selecting a drink and finding the price Verification version of E1: loop for all drinks: Read a tuple from the (drink, price) Extract the drink from the tuple Perform E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, and E9</head><p>If (ERROR), then process a report www.ijacsa.thesai.org Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows the validation of all combinations of coins to be stored in their boxes and the generation of the correct amount.</p><p>We assume that the machine initially has some coins from each of the assumed three types of coins, to return change when the input amount is greater than the price. For validation purposes, this initial amount is increased to cover all types of combinations of input amounts. Accordingly, different combinations of coins are fed to E10, which are distributed to their appropriate places (E14), and their amount is generated (E11). It is not difficult to develop such an internal system in a vending-machine factory with which to test each machine.</p><p> Super-event 3: Comparing the amount and price and outputting the result</p><p>The third validation process involves comparing the amount and price and observing the results of that comparison, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>. -All prices and amounts produced in phases 1 and 2 are fed to E15, during which the amount and price are compared. The results of this comparison are as follows.</p><p>If the amount is less than the price, then a message is produced (E21 and E22).</p><p>If the amount is equal to or greater than the price, then the correct change is produced by processing the coins (E17, E18, and E19).</p><p>-A drink is output.</p><p>We assume that a validation system takes the outputs of super-events 1 and 2 and produces the physical activities above in super-event 3. The level at which all possible variations of inputs are exhausted depends on the amount and price values produced in the first two super-events.</p><p>Nevertheless, in reality, the level of testing is a subjective decision based on evaluations conducted as part of the modeldevelopment procedure.</p><p>V. VALIDATING AN ONLINE SHOPPING SYSTEM Bures, Ahmed, and Zamli <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed a model-based test-case-generation algorithm that uses directed graphs and test requirements to model the system being tested. They proposed a method using a directed graph and a set of test requirements to try to satisfy a defined test-coverage level together. They modeled an online shopping system, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>, as a running example to document the presented concepts and algorithms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows the TM model constructed to reflect the given activity diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>.  First, the customer applies for registration (circle 1), which is processed by the system (2) to create a login account (3) that is added to the set of registered accounts (4 and 5). Note how the login account file is processed to add a new account.</p><p> The customer requests to log in (6) and the request is processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to extract the login account from the request <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Additionally, the accounts file is processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> to retrieve an account <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, which is compared with the input account <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. If the two accounts are not the same, then the next account in the accounts file is retrieved for comparison. This process continues until the two accounts are found to be the same <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Here, we ignore the situation in which the account is not filed in the file because the activity diagram does not mention it. Here, we can add a trigger for an error message to flow to the customer.</p><p> Then, the system sends a request for a discount <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, which is processed by the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, to reply ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) with a code (no discount is a type of code). The code is processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> to be compared with the set of codes <ref type="bibr">(18, 19, 20, and 21)</ref>. When the code is found, the percentage of discount is calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and, together with the price <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, is processed to calculate the payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and invoice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p> Accordingly, the system requests the method of payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, and the customer processes ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) that request to input such a method <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, which flows to the system, where it is processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. According to the payment method, the system either sends an invoice online <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> or to the branch <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.  The events in the model can be specified as follows (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>).    Apparently, our hypothesis that TM representation would lend itself to such division of high-level events is true for this shopping-system representation. We can apply the same type of informal validation. However, it is important to point out that the super-events may have relationships with "use cases"; thus, UML use case diagrams are a topic to be investigated in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper focused on examining the notion of validation using activity diagrams and proposed an informal validation process. This validation process involved requirements, versus specifications expressed by a diagram. Informal validation is a type of model checking that requires the model to be small enough to verify in a limited space or time. Accordingly, the model diagram is divided into subdiagrams for this purpose. We claimed that the TM behavioral model comes with a particular dispositional structure that allows designers to "carve" a diagram into smaller components for informal validation. This was shown through two case studies concerning vending machine and online shopping systems. This result seems plausible because TM modeling is founded upon five generic actions. Thus, generic events have no subevents, and higher-level events are built from these generic events. Generic events can happen in diverse regions, and they can reoccur. It seems the building structures from the five generic actions "collapse" into smaller structural partitions according to certain aspects such as functionality. The number </p></div>

Event 3 (E3): The system adds the new account to the accounts file. Event 4 (E4): A customer sends a login request. Event 5 (E5): The system extracts the login account from the request and sends it to be checked as a legal account. Event 6 (E6): The accounts file is processed to retrieve an account, which is sent for comparison with the input account. Event 7 (E7): The input account is compared with the account retrieved from the file. Event 8 (E8): The input account is not the same as the account from the file. Event 9 (E9): The input account is found among the legitimate accounts; hence, a request for the discount code is sent to the customer. Event 10 (E10): The customer sends a discount code (possibly a code for no discount). Event 11 (E11): The code is sent to find its corresponding discount percentage. Event 12 (E12): The list of codes is processed to retrieve one code at a time. Event 13 (E13): The retrieved code is sent to be processed. Event 14 (E14): The code is compared with the list of codes. Event 15 (E15): The code is found; thus, a request for the payment method is sent to the customer. Event 16 (E16): The customer sends the payment method. Event 17 (E17): The payment method is processed. Event 18 (E18): The payment method is in the branch. Event 19 (E19): The online payment method is chosen. Event 20 (E20): The code is found; thus, the discount percentage is extracted. Event 21 (E21): The price is received. Event 22 (E22): The discount percentage and price are used to calculate the required payment. Event 23 (E23): The payment is used in generating the invoice. Event 24 (E24): The invoice is sent to the branch. Event 25 (E25): The invoice is sent to the online payment system. ijacsa.thesai.org</figDesc></figure>
