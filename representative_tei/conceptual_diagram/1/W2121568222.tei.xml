<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Suicide is an important public health issue among rural communities although there is no single pattern of suicide in rural areas. Despite this, there are common themes in much of the research evidence on suicide in rural areas. From the published research in the area, a conceptual model of rural suicide has been developed which can be used by clinical and public health services when considering possible routes of intervention. Lessons learned: This model provides a way of considering suicide in rural areas. Local staff can use it to consider which issues are most relevant to their area. It allows classification of existing interventions, and deciding which other areas of work might be of local value. For researchers and service planners, it provides a way of classifying interventions and describing projects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Issue: A conceptual model can be defined as 'a type of diagram which shows a set of relationships between factors that are believed to impact or lead to a target condition'. The model presented here uses the 'Cry of pain/ Entrapment' model of suicide risk to build a framework of factors which are associated with suicide in rural areas. Cross-setting factors associated with suicide rates include gender, poverty, mental illness, substance use, biological factors including apparent genetic risk, coping skills and media coverage of suicide. There are, however, other factors that appear to have particular importance in rural areas. These include rural stressors, such as isolation and political and social exclusion; factors affecting support, including social support, cultural norms on help-seeking, stigma associated with mental illness service availability; factors affecting the decision to self-harm, including modelling and cultural views on self-harm, and issues affecting the likelihood of self-harm resulting in death, including method availability, norms on methods of self-harm and treatment availability after harm occurs. Identifying which of these areas are the greatest local priorities helps to target activity.</p><p>suicide in rural areas in some countries, and increasing rates in some rural settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</p><p>Interventions in suicide are often aimed at people in groups at higher than average risk of suicide. It is very difficult to measure the effectiveness of interventions because suicide is a relatively uncommon outcome, despite its large societal impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . The effect of this is that it is very difficult to undertake intervention trials large enough to show an impact on suicide rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . As a result, evidence of the effectiveness of an intervention is often lacking, and planners may take this paucity of evidence to mean that there is no coherent way of planning local intervention work.</p><p>Health and social care staff may consider suicide prevention mainly in terms of their ability to change an individual's suicidal behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . The range of interventions that may affect suicide are, however, wider than work on individual behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Reviews of rural suicide make it clear that social and cultural factors are important in suicide risk as well as individual characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . This review describes the known risk factors for suicide in rural areas, and draws them together into a conceptual model of rural suicide. By identifying the known factors, the authors sought to identify points at which healthcare workers in local areas may be able to intervene in order to reduce suicide rates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model</head><p>A conceptual model can be defined as 'a type of diagram which shows a set of relationships between factors that are believed to impact or lead to a target condition' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</p><p>Conceptual models have been proposed for aspects of suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> , and for rural issues.</p><p>After reviewing existing suicide models, this model has been developed according to the established 'Cry of pain/ Entrapment' model, described below <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . This model is a particularly good fit for rural suicide because it includes acknowledgment of the role of social and cultural factors in suicide, while not excluding the role of biological and service issues. It can be argued that factors such as social isolation increase the likelihood of defeat, entrapment and 'no rescue', which are core to the Cry of pain/ Entrapment model. This model uses the Cry of pain/ Entrapment model of suicide risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> to build a framework of factors in the literature which are associated with suicide in rural areas. Williams argues that stressful experiences resulting in feelings of defeat and loss can increase the risk of suicide. These appraisals are particularly harmful when the person cannot escape from the defeating situation.</p><p>In turn, it is this state of entrapment combined with no opportunities for rescue which Williams posits as associated with an elevated risk of suicide due to the activation of the 'learned helplessness script'. Learned helplessness is the realisation that there is no relationship between individual action and outcome. Williams and Pollock <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> proposed that suicidal behaviour is reactive and the response ('the cry') to a situation that has three components: defeat, no escape, and no rescue. O'Connor et al, among others, have provided empirical evidence in support of this model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</p><p>The original Cry of Pain/ Entrapment model was designed to examine individual psychological processes, and their relation to suicide. It is apparent from the recent reviews of rural suicide, however, that individual actions do not occur in isolation and are affected by the social, economic and cultural context. This model, therefore, places suicide in a social, economic and cultural context. This rural conceptual model is shown in diagrammatic form (Fig1). There are factors which increase the risk of suicide in almost all settings, which the present authors have termed 'cross-setting factors'. There are also particular stressors more likely to affect rural populations. The ability to cope with the situation is affected by a range of factors including views on seeking help, social networks and service availability. The decision to self-harm in this situation is not inevitable, and is affected by social and cultural norms, and the individual's view of self-harm as an option. Finally, if self-harm is undertaken, the likelihood of death resulting from the self-harm is affected by the choice of method of self-harm, and the availability of rapid care if the person survives the initial attempt.</p><p>The components of the model are, therefore:</p><p>• the occurrence of stressors</p><p>• the judgement by the individual of their ability to cope with the problem, or to escape from it</p><p>• a potential assessment that they are unable to change the situation</p><p>• a decision to self-harm</p><p>• the likelihood of death resulting from that selfharm.</p><p>While there is no suggestion that all the stages apply in all instances of death by suicide, the model does provide a structure within which to consider rural suicide. Each of the component parts of the model (Fig1) will now be discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-setting factors:</head><p>The factors shown under 'crosssetting factors' have some association with suicide in any setting. Subsequent components of the model identify issues of particular interest in rural areas, but some cross-setting factors are best summarised here.</p><p>Male sex is consistently associated with higher suicide rates, with the exceptions of India and China <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21</ref> . People living in poverty have higher than average suicide rates in most studies, although the strength of the association varies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Mental illness is associated with higher levels of suicide and suicidal ideation, with marked increases in rates, particularly among people with mood disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> . Substance misuse is associated with higher suicide rates. In relation to alcohol, people are more likely to kill themselves when intoxicated, and people with a problematic alcohol consumption have higher rates of self-harm and suicide than those without such a problem. Similar findings have been reported for drug misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26</ref> .</p><p>There is increasing evidence that biological factors are associated with suicide risk, with higher rates found in some regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27</ref> , and families hypothesised as being linked to genetic predisposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29</ref> . It is apparent, however, that this risk is modified by environmental influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30</ref> .</p><p>There are also a range of psychological factors associated with suicide risk. These include problem-solving deficits, avoidant coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , reduced positive future thinking 31 and impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> . In some studies, media coverage of particular deaths by suicide was associated with higher rates in subsequent weeks, and there is reasonable evidence that this is likely to be a causal link <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34</ref> .</p><p>Stressors: Isolation has been reported to be a stressor in some areas and occupations. In high income countries, farmers are now likely to work alone for long periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35</ref> . In other cases, a spouse may be isolated on a farm or rural dwelling. If there is access to only one vehicle, and public transport is poor, then enforced isolation may result. In some countries, including Australia and Canada, there can be very large distances between settlements.</p><p>Rural areas have been subject to enormous change in some countries, a process sometimes termed 'rural restructuring'. Depopulation and ageing populations are common <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Farm incomes have declined in many areas, and pressures have increased to also earn income from employment in nonfarming jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36</ref> . Control over activities in some areas may be affected by environmental pressures.</p><p>Some groups in rural areas have experienced significant social or political exclusion. Indigenous groups report considerable cultural disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> , as in the forced education of many Australian Aboriginal groups, and other groups such as the Inuit in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40</ref> . Many groups feel excluded from national processes, and qualitative work reports feelings of dislocation and exclusion that are likely to be potent additional stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> .</p><p>People who are identified as 'different' may experience additional pressures. Homosexual people often report substantial stigma in rural areas, with resultant adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> . Quinn discusses the evidence for an association between the experience of being homosexual in some rural areas, and suicide risk, and concludes that there is insufficient information on the nature of the association <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48</ref> . Nevertheless, there is good evidence for the occurrence of stigma and discrimination, and a strong argument for work on social attitudes. Some research is now exploring resiliency in homosexual people in rural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49</ref> . This type of work should offer insights in to protective factors for rural homosexual people.</p><p>Factors affecting support: Some groups are less likely to access care. In some countries, farm workers are a particularly stoic, self-reliant <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51</ref> group. When asked to list sources of care, they often identify informal supports. In part, this may be due to stigma related to psychological distress and mental illness, and there are numerous reports of continuing stigma attached to mental illness in rural communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52</ref> .</p><p>Although there is little evidence that the prevalence of mental illness is any greater in rural than in urban areas, mental health services for those who do suffer from such illness tend to be less available in many rural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53</ref> . Where such services do exist, geographical constraints may make them less able to respond to a crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref> . The availability of services outside working hours may be further reduced because of the difficulty in sustaining on-call arrangements in large areas with widely distributed staff.</p><p>Some rural areas, and some people within rural populations, have well developed social networks. In other cases, perhaps because of geographical isolation or stigma, social support may be less available.</p><p>Religious groups and spiritual views can affect support availability. Some cultural and religious groups offer potent support to members, and religious beliefs can be an important strength for people. In some rural and Indigenous groups, these issues can be particularly important <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57</ref> .</p><p>Substantial social disruption to Indigenous groups is associated with less identification with traditional religious beliefs, and reduced connection with religious, cultural or spiritual tradition is associated with higher rates of suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58</ref> .</p><p>Traditions vary markedly according to the group, however, and associations therefore vary from setting to setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59</ref> .</p><p>Decision to self-harm: Views about the acceptability of self-harm and of suicide vary widely. In traditional Inuit culture, taking a decision to remove a burden from a community has been viewed positively, and this may increase the acceptability of self-harm, and therefore the likelihood of considering it as an option <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60</ref> .</p><p>Some rural communities have experienced high levels of self-harm and suicide. Where this has happened, suicide may appear more readily on an individual's list of possible responses to stress and perceived helplessness. Young people who have never been held in high regard by their community may see the intense community response to a death as validation of their life and value, with a subsequent increase in the likelihood of this being identified as an option <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61</ref> .</p><p>Likelihood of death: Regardless of intent, once a person has decided to self-harm the likelihood of death is affected by the method they choose, and by the availability of treatment if the episode is life-threatening but not immediately fatal. Some methods, such as the use of firearms, drowning and hanging have high case fatality rates. Firearm ownership is common in rural areas in many countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63</ref> , and a large number of country dwellers are familiar with their use. Hanging and drowning are difficult to prevent, and are common methods of self-harm in rural areas. Not all self-poisoning has a high case fatality rate, but some types of pesticide poisoning are very likely to result in death. Pesticides are often widely available and poorly controlled in rural areas, particularly in low-and middleincome countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">65</ref> . The choice of method is affected by local understandings of how self-harm in conducted, and while this is partly affected by media depictions, local knowledge of previous events is also likely to be important.</p><p>Where a person survives the attempt but is left in lifethreatening condition, medical assistance may not be available in rural areas. In low-and middle-income countries where there is limited transport infrastructure and low healthcare resources, treatment can be difficult to access.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use of the model</head><p>The literature on suicide in rural areas is large and expanding, making it difficult for busy planners and service providers to read and integrate. The conceptual model provides a structure for use in local areas to when considering preventative efforts and seeking to identify areas for intervention. While it is not possible to consider all the rural suicide-prevention literature here, some examples of possible areas of work will be outlined. The best response in individual areas will depend on the particular pattern of suicide and suicidal behaviour in the local area.</p><p>Cross-setting factors confirm that economic development work, while apparently distant from death by suicide, can help to reduce poverty, which is an important cause of increased risk of suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Local work on increasing uptake of eligible state benefits and so increasing household income can be one method of poverty reduction in countries where this is a relevant policy option.</p><p>Substance misuse and mental illness are common risk factors. Local areas will be able to judge the extent to which substance misuse, in particular, is likely to be important.</p><p>Reviewing the availability of and access to services for these problems, including mood disorders, will be important in overall efforts to reduce suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">66</ref> . It can be difficult to increase investment in services, but increasing support to isolated professionals may be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">67</ref> .</p><p>Other areas can also be addressed. Media reporting of suicide appears to be important in affecting public perception, and this can be influenced <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68</ref> . This is also relevant to modelling suicidal behaviour, and the choice of method of self-harm. Many education systems have begun to deliver training on coping skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">70</ref> . Isolation and poor social networks are associated with increased risk in some rural groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63</ref> . Stigma can affect help-seeking and willingness to discuss problems, and programs such as those developed by Suicide Prevention Australia can be designed to reduce this <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71</ref> . The availability of lethal means of self-harm can be influenced. In areas where pesticide poisoning is the main method of suicide, there is encouraging evidence of the effectiveness of specific interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">73</ref> . In other areas, access to firearms may be a more important issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr">[76]</ref> .</p><p>There  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Conceptual model of rural suicide.</figDesc></figure>
