<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding of such mixed-state criticality is called for, particularly with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle for such entangled states of matter. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry -a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the N → 1 limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at Θ-angle π, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. At the conceptual level, our protocol can be viewed as a non-unitary extension of the measurement-based quantum computation scheme, and highlights a general fundamental relation between measurement-induced phase transitions and mixed-state criticality. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology, while also providing a concrete protocol amenable to simulation on near-term quantum devices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the early days of quantum mechanics, Born's rule has been providing a link connecting quantum measurements to the probabilistic dynamics they induce. Its generalization from few-body to many-body quantum systems allows to connect quantum many-body dynamics to (classical) statistical mechanics with strong disorder. A well-studied example of this link is the connection of noisy topological quantum memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to the random bond Ising model (RBIM) and the emergence of an error threshold described by Nishimori criticality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as the disorder-induced generalization of Ising criticality. Such a link to Nishimori physics has recently been uncovered also in the context of monitored quantum circuit dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, many-body teleportation thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and mixed-state phase transitions in open quantum systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. From a symmetry perspective, the most striking difference between clean Ising and disordered Nishimori criticality is their relation to Kramers-Wannier self-duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which is an idiosyncratic symmetry for the clean Ising transition, while for Nishimori criticality it is inevitably and strongly broken <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Self-duality has long been appreciated as one of the most elegant symmetries for a many-body system * guoyizhu@hkust-gz.edu.cn to exhibit, often serving as a guiding light to deeper understanding, such as Wegner's seminal insight <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> connecting spin to gauge-invariant models and, subsequently, the interplay of gauge and matter shaped by t'Hooft <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and the Fradkin/Shenker phase diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Today, self-duality is again providing a spotlight in the exploration of quantum circuits where its non-invertible algebraic character, its relation to anomalies and fractionalization are broadly discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This has led us to question whether in the context of monitored circuit dynamics there is a way to twist Born's rule into preserving self-duality, what kind of criticality this might induce, and how decoherence or coherent deformations might then break it down, e.g., to Nishimori criticality.</p><p>Here we provide a variant of the von Neumann entanglement entropy of mixed states which unifies the notions of general measurement-induced phase transitions and associated decoherence-induced mixed state criticality by simultaneously providing an overarching diagnostic of distinct universal critical data of both, the measurement record in the bulk and the enganglement of the boundary quantum state. We apply this quantity to demonstrate how statistical ("weak") Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry can protect decoherence-induced criticality in mixed states. In particular, we show that self-duality can naturally appear (even at zero temperature) in the form of an average "weak" symmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> when decohering (i) a short-range entangled symmetry protected topological state (SPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>), (ii) a long- SPT can be realized as a cluster state on a Lieb lattice (with site and bond qubits), which can be viewed as a lattice gauge state with matter electric charge eand gauge magnetic flux m-vortices, that are dual to each other. Dephasing the site qubit uncondenses e resulting in average or correctable topological order as a deconfined gauge state that spontaneously breaks the 1-form Z (1) 2 symmetry. Dephasing the bond qubit uncondenses m and leads to the GHZ-like state as an average Z (0) 2 spontaneous symmetry breaking order. When both e and m are uncondensed, it can leave a boundary critical state with weak self-dual symmetry and weak Z (0) 2 symmetry. (b) Protocol: preparing a cluster state on a Lieb lattice, and measure the site qubit in X basis, and the bond qubit in cos(θ)Z + sin(θ)X basis with a tunable angle θ, leaving a boundary chain untouched. The bulk can also be viewed as a "register" that records all the measurement outcomes. In the schematic, we deduce the e and m-vortices from the measurement outcomes. (c) The phase diagram. When the bond measurement angle θ is tuned to the symmetric angle π/4, the system exhibits the weak self-dual criticality, described by the SO(2N )/U (N ) Non-linear Sigma Model (NLSM) at topological Θ-angle π in N → 1 limit. Changing the measurement angle θ at the microscopic level has the same effect as changing the topological Θ-angle in the long-wave-length theory. Different perturbations can be used to tune the e-vortices away from duality: the upper panel uses the (measurement) noise to mask and blur the existence of an e-vortex, while the lower panel uses the deformation to damp it. Within the phase diagram, the white region is the trivial state; the dark gray region indicates the strong-to-weak spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SW-SSB) of Z2 ordered phase with long-range glassy correlation [|⟨ZiZj⟩|] ≠ 0 and [⟨ZiZj⟩] = 0 (easily verfied at θ = π/2); the light gray region has only weak Z2 symmetry due to the noise, but exhibits the same long-range correlation. There are 3 paradigmatic critical points in this phase diagram: the Nishimori critical point, the weak self-dual critical point, and the Ising+ critical point. The arrows in the phase diagram outline the RG flow indicated by our numerical results. Here we unfold the two perpendicular phase diagrams (by tuning ps and pη, respectively) into the plane, and their crossing line ps = 0 = pη is not a phase transition generically. range entangled toric code <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, or (iii) a measurement prepared cat state <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, either by projective measurement or by maximal dephasing noise. Specifically, we demonstrate that the bulk decoherence of a cluster state <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which on a Lieb lattice exhibits Z (0) 2 × Z</p><p>(1) 2 (0-form and 1-form) SPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, can lead to a mixed quantum critical state on its boundary, described by a self-dual variant of the random bond Ising model. The same boundary state can appear upon decohering a toric code or a mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) state (dubbed "Nishimori's cat" state in Refs. <ref type="bibr">3 and 5)</ref>. This trio of states is, of course, not incidental as all three of them -the cluster state on a Lieb lattice, the toric code on one of its sublattices, and the GHZ/cat state on the other sublattice -can be unified via a Z 2 lattice gauge theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, where the site and bond qubits in the underlying Lieb lattice are interpreted as matter and Z 2 gauge fields, respectively. When the matter field is decohered in a first step, one obtains a deconfined gauge theory as an intermediate state, which is the topological toric code <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1(a)</ref>. If, on the other hand, the gauge field is first decohered, then one obtains a gauge-symmetrized Z 2 ferromagnetic order, i.e. the state dubbed Nishimori's cat <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Finally, if both the matter and the gauge degrees of freedom are decohered in the bulk, one might naively expect a trivial state. However, the emergence of self-dual symmetry prohibits triviality and protects criticality: a vestigial quantum critical state persists at the boundary -this is the aforementioned critical boundary state that reveals itself upon close inspection of the mixed-state ensemble after bulk decoherence.</p><p>From a symmetry perspective, the boundary state inherits the strong Z 2 symmetry from the bulk</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">⎛ ⎝ ∏ j X j ⎞ ⎠ ρ = ρ .</formula><p>However, a strong KW self-dual symmetry, KWρ ∝ ρ, is explicitly broken by the measurement-induced disorder in the bulk. Nevertheless, a weak KW self-dual symmetry KW ρ KW = ρ can be preserved on average, which can protect the mixed critical state, forbidding a flow into the trivial state or a strong-toweak spontaneous symmetry breaking phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> with spin glass order parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Before going into the details of our study, we want to provide a brief overview of our main findings. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> summarizes the conceptual idea of decohering the SPT order of a cluster state via the quantum circuit schematically illustrated in panel (b). Introducing both incoherent noise (parametrized by p s ) and a coherent deformation (parameterized by p η ) we have explored the phase diagram of panel (c), which centers around a line where self-duality is preserved as a weak symmetry TABLE I. Overview of the mixed-state criticality originating from Ising. Shown is a characterization of the three mixed-state critical theories of the phase diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(c</ref>), and a comparison to the pure-state Ising universality class. The asterisk indicates results with system size Lx &gt; 1000 taken from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref>  (parametrized by the measurement angle θ for p s = p η = 0) and which exhibits a critical point whose universality and field theoretical description is distinct from both the Nishimori criticality induced by incoherent noise and yet another type of critical behavior, dubbed "Ising+" induced by the coherent deformation -both of which break the weak self-duality, present along the center line of our phase diagram. Using extensive numerical simulations that combine elements from tensor network, Gaussian fermion, and Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the critical exponents of this novel self-dual quantum critical point as well as the other two critical theories, relying primarily on Shannon entropy, entanglement entropy, and coherent information measures. A summary of the three types of criticality is given above in Table I. Having established that these three critical theories fall into distinct universality classes, we explore the renormalization group (RG) flow between them by tracking the changes of critical exponent and central charge estimates as we break the self-dual symmetry upon moving away from the center line of our phase diagram. Notably, we find clear numerical evidence that incoherent noise initiates an RG flow from self-dual to Nishimori criticality. On the other hand, upon introducing a coherent wave function deformation that breaks self-duality, we discover another critical theory (in the limit of infinitely strong deformation) that can be described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT) that can analytically be shown to retain the unitary Ising CFT in a subset of its operators, which is why we have dubbed it "Ising+" criticality. In our phase diagram, we find that this critical point is an unstable fixed point with numerical evidence for an RG flow back to the weak self-dual criticality (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.)</p><p>More generally, the diagnostic we employ unifies the notions of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) and decoherence-induced mixed states. The MIPT typically focuses on the spacetime dynamics of a monitored quantum circuit, emphasizing the entanglement entropy of the quantum state at the final time, i.e. its 'temporal boundary', while the latter often refers to a quantum state experiencing a noisy channel without necessarily considering the time dynamics. In our setting, we design the 2D system as a hybrid with a decohered classical bulk and an untouched quantum boundary, as a measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) way of realizing the MIPT. In this way, the measurement outcomes are materialized and carried in the bulk, while the monitored evolved quantum state resides on the boundary. In this setting, the bulk undergoes a decoherence-induced mixed state transition, that is signaled by the Shannon entropy of its measurement record <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, yielding a universal finite-size correction of Casimir-energy type at the critical point. The boundary undergoes an MIPT, whose quantum trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy obeys universal critical scaling at exactly the same critical point. We unify both quantities in a single entanglement entropy S AC of the 2D mixed state between (referring to the drawing below) the region A of length l on the boundary (standing for "Alice") and its boundary complement "Bob"</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Charlie Alice Bob L x l L y S AC = - πc Casimir L y 6L x + c ent 3 ln ( L x π sin πl L x ) + ⋯ (1)</formula><p>which encodes both the bulk and boundary conformal data.</p><p>In particular, while the universal bulk finite-size scaling correction reveals the effective central charge c Casimir of the underlying non-unitary CFT, we caution that the universal number <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> c ent extracted from the boundary entanglement entropy is not equivalent to this central charge, c Casimir ≠ c ent . This feature sharply distinguishes the monitored (i.e. random) non-unitary CFT from a conventional 'non-random', translationally invariant unitary CFT, where in the latter case the two universal quantities c Casimir and c ent are well known to be precisely identical, and are equal to the central charge c, which vanishes in the monitored ('random') case. The sodefined variant S AC of the von Neumann entropy is applicable to generic MIPTs and critical mixed states, and is discussed in more detail in Sec. IV C, see in particular Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>, with the mixed state written as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">3</ref>). These expressions apply to any MIPT, where "(em)" is replaced by the set of measurement outcomes from the entire space-time history of the circuit. In a mixed state, "(em)" is replaced by the good quantum number where the density matrix is block diagonalized, such as the toric code under bit-flip and phase-flip error <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The remainder of this manuscript illustrates this very general physics in detail for the example of the specific system which forms the topic of this paper, with Sec. II introducing our mixed-state preparation protocol and its decoherence channels. We also briefly point out the underlying Z 2 gauge symmetry and its tensor network representation. In Sec. III we then proceed to introduce four alternative model representations in terms of a (1+1)D monitored circuit, a 2D classical stat mech model, followed by a (1+1)D Majorana circuit and a two-dimensional Chalker-Coddington network model, along with a discussion of Kramers-Wannier self-duality in all four formulations. The self-dual critical state is discussed in detail in Sec. IV based on its coherent information, bulk Shannon entropy, and boundary entanglement entropy. In Sec. V we then discuss the entire phase diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1(c</ref>) in detail with a particular emphasis on the RG flows between the various critical theories. We close with a broader discussion and an outlook in Sec. VI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Protocol: preparation and decoherence</head><p>Our protocol comprises two principal steps: (i) the preparation of an entangled resource state -the cluster state, which, in step (ii), is subject to decoherence by either projective measurements or 50% Pauli noise in some orientable basis direction. For the first step we prepare a short-ranged entangled cluster state <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>: ∏ CZ |+⟩ ⊗N using a finite-depth circuit on a (square) Lieb lattice as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1(b)</ref>, where we discriminate between the bond qubits Z ij and the site qubits Z j with i(j) denoting sites of the square lattice. Secondly, we dephase all the qubits in the bulk in a designated basis, by projectively measuring the site qubits in the X direction and the bond qubits in a tilted direction</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ θ = cos(θ)Z + sin(θ)X .</formula><p>The "measurement angle" θ can also be understood as the angle of a coherent unitary rotation error around the Y -axis right before a measurement in the Z-basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> (not to be confused with the topological Θ-angle of the NLSM). Schematically, an elementary building block of this circuit for a given bond then takes the form below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Z + + + CZ X X CZ Z Z R Y (θ) ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ site site bond</formula><p>, for a bond of the square lattice with two qubits at the sites (denoted by i and j) and one qubit on the center of the bond (denoted by ij). Here all qubits (at the sites as well as the bonds) are originally initialized in X-basis eigenstates |+⟩ = X |+⟩, then subjected to two controlled-Z (CZ) gates</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">CZ × CZ = exp(-iπ(1 -Z i )(1 -Z ij )/4)exp(-iπ(1 -Z j )(1 -Z ij )/4</formula><p>) that (maximally) entangle the nearest neighboring site-and bond-qubits. Before the final round of measurements in the X and Z bases, respectively, the bond qubit is rotated via R Y (θ) = exp (iθY /2) by the measurement angle θ. The measurement channel can be viewed as a maximally dephasing channel: N = N s ○ N b where N s (⋅) = (⋅) + X(⋅)X acts on the site qubits and N b (⋅) = (⋅)+σ θ (⋅)σ θ acts upon the bond qubits. If the measurement outcome on a bond is negative Z ij = -1, we perform a feedback Z i Z j to its adjacent site qubits, which equivalently flips the site measurement outcome and can be done in a post-processing manner. Note that, from a symmetry perspective, there is a distinction of the site versus bond qubits -the SPT order of the cluster state on the underlying Lieb lattice is protected by a 0-form Z 2 symmetry for the site qubits and a 1-form magnetic Z</p><p>(1) 2 symmetry for the bond qubits <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Due to this inequivalence of the symmetry forms, the decoherence of the site and the bond qubits N s ○ N b leads to two distinct intermediate states when decomposing it into two steps:</p><p>(i) N b : If first the bond qubits are measured and dephased <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, this leaves a 2D state which can be tuned between a product state and the "Nishimori cat" state <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, i.e. a glassy GHZ state exhibiting strong-toweak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) order <ref type="bibr">[8, 9] [46]</ref>.

The vertex stabilizers can be interpreted as a Z 2 Gauss law, where |X j = -1⟩ for the site qubit denotes a Z 2 matter charge usually labeled as e-vortex, and Z ij operator for the bond qubit denotes a corresponding electric field. Consequently, |X ij = -1⟩ labels a nonzero gauge field, and the bond stabilizer Z i X ij Z j = 1 describes the minimal coupling between matter and charge, where the matter hopping is coupled with the gauge connection X ij operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.

Since a gauge transformation can be independently generated by creating a local X loop around any vertex, one can count a total number of 2 LxLy gauge-equivalent configurations that share the same boundary quantum state |ψ(em)⟩. We will therefore label the bulk bits only by their em-vortex configuration for brevity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Mixed state dynamics</head><p>Finally, note that the object of interest in the following is the total mixed state of the bulk and the boundary, Eq. 3, -we will show that this bulk-boundary mixed state can exhibit longrange entanglement. If, on the contrary, one considers only the boundary mixed state by simply tracing out the bulk (and thereby throwing out all bulk measurement outcomes), the resulting boundary density matrix ∑ em |ψ(em)⟩⟨ψ(em)| = I is a short-range entangled maximally-mixed state. Such a distinction between monitored dynamics (keeping the measurement outcomes) versus dissipative dynamics (averaging over measurement outcomes) is related to the fact that measurement-induced phase transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref> are only visible in the ensemble of quantum trajectories, but not in the associated quantum channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EQUIVALENT MODEL REPRESENTATIONS</head><p>To understand the unusual phenomenon of our mixedstate criticality and particularly its manifestation in a critical boundary state, we enumerate four distinct, but mathematically equivalent models that all capture this physics: a monitored (1 + 1)D quantum Ising chain, a 2D disordered classical statistical mechanics model, a monitored (1 + 1)D Majorana fermion chain, and the (2 + 1)D Chalker Coddington network model. We discuss the Kramers-Wannier duality in these representations of the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. (1+1)D monitored quantum circuit</head><p>Our first representation follows the spirit of measurementbased quantum computation (MBQC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>, where one views one spatial dimension of a resource quantum state (prior to any measurement) as a fictitious time dimension and a subsequent sequence of spatial measurements then allows to effectively induce a unitary evolution (which implements a quantum computation) along this fictitious time. Here, in analogy, we can also view one spatial dimension of our bulk quantum state (prior to the measurements) as a fictitious time dimension, which then evolves under measurement and builds up the entanglement in the boundary quantum state (corresponding to the final time). Our circuit protocol, recast as tensor network diagram, can then be derived to be equivalent to a (1 + 1)D imaginary-time evolving transverse-field Ising model. The bulk classical bits serve as the "register" that record the measurement outcomes, which determine the evolution of the quantum state, i.e. its quantum trajectory.</p></div>

In the absence of e and m random vortices, such a pure state has the strong KW self-dual symmetry. That is, in the long wavelength limit, the resulting critical (boundary) state is effectively described by the 2D Ising CFT, protected by strong Z 2 symmetry and by strong KW self-dual symmetry. The non-invertibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> of the transformation can be deduced when the MPO in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(a</ref>) is closed in periodic boundary condition, which inevitably maps ∏ j X j+1/2 = 1 and thus carries a global parity projector.</p><p>Notably, the transfer operators M Z and M X above are nonunitary operators, which can be interpreted as the Kraus operators of effectively weak measurements of the Z j Z j+1 and X j operators in the (1 + 1)D dynamics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement-induced random quantum trajectories</head><p>Due to the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement, our effective Ising circuit is subject to both bit-flip X and phase-flip Z errors, manifesting themselves in the random measurement outcomes of the bond and the site qubits, respectively. Using a gauge transformation as illustrated in Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-unitary measurement-based quantum computation</head><p>We started our discussion of the (1 + 1)D monitored quantum circuit model with an analogy to the framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Let us close this discussion by pointing out some additional connections and distinctions in this context. Similar to the MBQC approach, we initiate our protocol from a cluster state as the principal entanglement resource and perform projective measurements in the bulk to propagate a 1D quantum state on the edge by means of quantum teleportation, trading time with space [89-93]. In the standard MBQC approach, the transfer matrix that evolves the quantum state was shown to be unitary and can implement universal quantum computation when the measurement angles are carefully chosen to lie along the Z direction or are restricted to within the XY plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. Then the measurement outcome is maximally random because each post-measurement unitary trajectory shares equal probability, as in the standard example of quantum teleportation with perfect entanglement resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref>. In the absence of noise one can always correct the measurement outcomes to obtain the same pure state. In contrast, in our protocol we tilt the measurement angle between Z and the XY plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">95]</ref> (equivalent to an imperfectly prepared cluster state <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), which turns the effective spatial propagation into a probabilistic nonunitary <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref> circuit. The measurement outcome is no longer maximally mixed but follows a highly correlated distribution. Not all post-measurement random pure states are guaranteed to be able to be corrected to the same pure state.</p></div>

For the system under consideration this is a superconductor in two spatial dimensions in Altland-Zirnbauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115]</ref> symmetry class D. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[114]</ref>, the two-dimensional space (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(d</ref>)) of the (2 + 1)D system represents the spacetime of the circuit depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>), and in a formulation of the (2+1)D system on a 2D spatial lattice and discrete time, this is referred to as a "Chalker-Coddington" model <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[116]</ref>: In each time-step of the discrete time the Majorana fermions propagate across a link of a square lattice [the so-called "surrounding lattice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[117]</ref>, whose sites are the midpoints of the links of the lattice in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(d)</ref>] whose plaquette-centers represent the locations of Ising spins (σ i ) on one sublattice, and dual Ising spins (µ p ) on the other sublattice of the bipartite lattice of plaquettes, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(c</ref>). A spin (σ i ) and dual spin (µ p ) located at (the center of) a plaquette corresponds to a (2 + 1)D vortex enforcing a minus sign for fermions encircling the plaquette in the time of the (2 + 1)D system. In this formulation, a negative sign of the variable "s ij " appearing in the transfer matrix, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>), corresponds to a pair σ i , σ j of vortices on nearest-neighbor sites i and j of the sublattice of spin plaquettes, while a negative sign of the variable "t p,q " in Eq.

In this language, the square of the partition function of the Ising model in any fixed configuration of e and m vortices (in a particular gauge) is obtained (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref>) by tracing over (two identical copies of Majorana, or equivalently a single copy of complex) fermions, which we denote by Z(e, m). (See Eq.

Historically, such a Chalker-Coddington model was (a) applied to various settings of generic ("uncorrelated") quenched disorder averages over configurations of Majorana fermion zero modes (e and m vortices) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113]</ref>. In a theoretical description using replicas, these situations correspond to the limit of the number N of replicas going to zero, N → 0. In the present work we apply, (b), the aforementioned Chalker-Coddington model to settings where e and m vortices are measured, and we are thus interested in quenched measurement disorder subjected specifically to the Born-rule probability distribution. In a theoretical description using replicas, these situations correspond <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">111]</ref> to the limit of the number N of replicas going to unity, N → 1. In both applications, (a) and (b), Kramers-Wannier duality -meaning the invariance of the respective probability distribution under Kramers-Wannier duality, also called "statistical", or "weak", or "average" Kramers-duality -plays an essential role for the resulting physical behavior of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship with previous work</head><p>The key conclusion of the prior work in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113]</ref>, referring to generic ("uncorrelated") quenched disorder (corresponding to the replica limit N → 0), was that there are two fundamentally different situations, leading to very different physical properties: case (i), discussed below, which does not exhibit a metallic phase, as well as case (ii) discussed below which does exhibit a metallic phase. We discuss those now in turn, with support of the schematics in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(e,</ref><ref type="figure">f):</ref> (i) In the case of the RBIM, in its entire phase diagram at and away from the Nishimori line, the vortices are allowed to appear only on one sublattice of plaquettes of the Chalker-Coddington model, namely on the sublattice of (say) spin plaquettes. In this case, only two phases are possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[118]</ref>, a ferromagnetic (topological) phase and a paramagnetic (topologically trivial) phase.</p><p>In the RBIM these vortices occur in adjacent pairs. Each such pair corresponds to a negative sign of the random variable s ij described in the first paragraph of this section. This model, the RBIM case (i), maximally violates statistical ("average") Kramers-Wannier symmetry since vortices are only allowed to occur on one of the two sublattices of plaquettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[119]</ref>, the (say) sublattice of spin plaquettes.</p><p>(ii) If, on the other hand, Majorana zero modes are also allowed to appear on the other sublattice of plaquettes of the Chalker-Coddington model, namely the sublattice of dual-spin plaquettes where they occur in adjacent pairs, then in addition to the ferromagnetic (topological) and paramagnetic (topologically trivial) phases, a third, metallic phase will occur in the phase diagram. This is the so-called Cho-Fisher (CF) model, originally intended <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120]</ref> as a formulation of the Nishimori system (a), but later shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112]</ref> to actually describe a different system with the novel properties described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113]</ref> and reviewed here. It should also be noted that it was proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref> that a metallic phase is forbidden when vortices are only allowed to occur on one sublattice of plaquettes of the Chalker-Coddington model, as is the case in the Nishimori model, case (a).</p><p>A variant of the CF model was also discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref> where vortices occur randomly with some probability on any site of the two sublattices of plaquettes of the Chalker-Coddington model, but with equal probability on both sublattices (dubbed the O(1)-model). This system was shown to exhibit only the metallic phase throughout its entire phase diagram, and no ferromagnetic nor paramagnetic phases whatsoever survives infinitesimal disorder strength.</p><p>We now discuss the two cases of distinct replica limits:</p><p>(a) N → 0 replica limit, uncorrelated quenched disorder.-The phase diagram of the CF model, case (ii), exhibits a line possessing average Kramers-Wannier symmetry along the phase boundary separating ferromagnetic (topological) and paramagnetic (non-topological) phases, and connecting the non-random (pure) Ising critical point with a multicritical point at which a transition to the metallic phase sets in, and continuing into the metallic phase. This self-dual line is depicted as the vertical line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(f) <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref>. Recent numerical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref> found that the RG flow emerges from the multicritical point and flows into the pure Ising critical point which (obviously) possesses "strong" as opposed to "statistical" ("weak", or "average" -in recent jargon) KW symmetry.</p><p>(b) N → 1 replica limit, Born measurement disorder.-The previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113]</ref>, briefly summarized in item (a) above, raises the question about the nature of these various phases and transitions when the quenched randomness does not originate from generic, uncorrelated randomness, but rather from measurements of the e and m degrees of freedom (representing (2+1)D vortices) satisfying the Born-rule probability distribution. This question has, in fact, been the very motivation for the work that we report in the paper at hand and is what we will address in the following.</p><p>It is useful to begin with the KW self-dual system which, in the above-reviewed language of the Chalker-Coddington model, is a version of the KW-self-dual line of the CF model, where however now randomness arises from measurements of e and m, and is thus subjected to the Born-rule probability distribution. In short, we will demonstrate that the KW self-dual model is a "measurement-version" of the CF model discussed in (a) (ii) above, in which the generic quenched disorder is replaced by the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical measurement outcomes. In that sense, the KW self-dual system is a self-dual 'cousin' of the Nishimori critical point (and it will be in a different universality class, as we also numerically confirm -see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).</p><p>As the self-dual circuit is a circuit of non-interacting fermions in Altland-Zirnbauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115]</ref> symmetry class D, it is generically described <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[122]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref>] by a NLSM with target space SO(2N )/U (N ) where N is the number of replicas. Moreover, following the same logic as that used in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref> for symmetry class DIII, the case of randomness arising from measurements satisfying the Born-rule probability distribution requires <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">111]</ref> taking the replica limit N → 1. In addition, and importantly for the present context, Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> established averaged (i.e. statistical) KW duality of this NLSM. As the topology of the target space SO(2N )/U (N ) allows <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for a Θ-term, criticality is known to occur when Θ = π. [This is in complete analogy with, e.g., the familiar O(3)-NLSM, describing the 1D Heisenberg chain.] In summary, this establishes the description of the KW self-dual point by the SO(2N )/U (N ) NLSM at Θ-angle Θ = π in the limit N → 1. (We note that independent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[106]</ref> arrived at the same conclusion about this critical point, starting from the microscopic ('lattice') formulation of Majorana fermion parity measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126]</ref>) Moreover, Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> also found that the SO(2N )/U (N ) NLSM as N → 1 is stable under RG to a certain class of deformations (not necessarily related to the ones we study numerically in the present paper). It is worth noting that with Born-rule measurements there is, in contrast to generic, uncorrelated quenched randomness [discussed in part (a) above], no stable metallic phase. This is easily understood as a consequence of the known RG beta function of the coupling constant of the NLSM on this symmetry class D target space (reproduced, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), which demonstrates stability of the metallic phase in the replica limit N → 0, relevant for case (a), while in the replica limit N → 1, relevant for case (b), the metallic phase is unstable. The phase diagram that thus emerges for the measurement-version of the CF model with Born-rule measurements is that depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> above (the same as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref>), except that the metallic phase is completely removed: There is then a vertical line describing the self-dual model connecting the nonrandom (pure) critical Ising point (bottom) with the KW selfdual fixed point (top). Moving to the right or to the left of this vertical line breaks statistical KW duality and leads to the ferromagnetic (topological) or paramagnetic (topologically trivial) phase. These are described by moving the Θ-angle of the NLSM away from π in one direction or the other.</p></div>

THE SELF-DUAL CRITICAL STATE</head><p>Let us start our discussion of mixed-state boundary criticality by characterizing the self-dual critical state first.

Such scans for different system sizes also allow us to extract the correlation length exponent ν from a finite-size scaling analysis.

Let Q be a set of qubits of a general quantum system that is the focus of our interest. In order to determine the coherent information, which indicates whether this logical memory is still intact, one employs a reference qubit R, whose state maximally entangles with the logical qubit state of the memory. For instance, when viewing the GHZ state as a repetition code, one would entangle the reference qubit together with the initial qubit chain to form a joint GHZ state</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">|ψ 0 ⟩ QR = |00⋯00⟩ Q ⊗ |0⟩ R + |11⋯11⟩ Q ⊗ |1⟩ R ,</formula><p>as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b)</ref>. When viewed from the Majorana fermion representation, this protocol can alternatively be interpreted as encoding and decoding the logical information in a Kitaev Majorana chain-based topological quantum computation setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref>. In the topologically nontrivial phase of the Majorana chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, the unpaired Majoranas at the boundaries form, within their topologically degenerate 2-state manifold, a mixed state of even and odd parities. This mixed state corresponds to a 2-dimensional logical code space without any encoding yet. It can, however, be purified by maximally entangling it with a reference qubit R <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref>.</p><p>The logical information being encoded into the system spreads through the bulk evolution, and meanwhile keeps being "eavesdropped" by the local measurements of an observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">133]</ref>, such that the spacetime evolution can be interpreted as a faulty channel. Whether the quantum logical information is stolen by the observer or whether it is still preserved in the system, is what is quantified by the quantum coherent information <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[128]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[130]</ref>]</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">I c = S vN (ρ QC ) -S vN (ρ QCR ) ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where we have included an additional index C indicating the existence of classical information (obtained from measurements) accessible for a decoder.

The density matrix element of R is determined by the partition function under the corresponding boundary conditions, which can be represented by the tensor network as follows: In the ordered phase θ → π/2, the domain wall decays exponentially with system size,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">⟨0 | ρ R | 1⟩ =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">⟨0| ρ R |1⟩ / ⟨0| ρ R |0⟩ ∝ O(e -Lx ),</formula><p>which means that R is almost diagonal and maximally mixed, thereby giving rise to a maximal coherent information</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">I c → ln 2.

For the non-perturbative regime between these two limits, we perform a hybrid Monte Carlo and Gaussian fermion numerical computation of the coherent information I c while sweeping θ, which is found to exhibit a clear level crossing near the selfdual point θ c = π/4 as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b</ref>). The clean finite-size collapse indicates the critical length exponent ν = 1.72 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. At θ &gt; π/4 the mixed 1D quantum state is a Z 2 SW-SSB phase.

The resultant state still preserves the weak Z 2 symmetry because of vanishing long-range correlation tr(ρZ i Z j ) = ∑ em P (em)⟨Z i Z j ⟩ em = 0.

Fitting our numerical data we extract an estimate of the effective central charge c Casimir = 0.447(1), for the self-dual point.</p><p>On a more technical note, we calculate this effective central charge estimate for the "vacuum state", i.e. a state in the even sector for which we enforce the absence of an m-vortex through the hole of the cylinder by restricting ∏ x s x,y=1 = +1 as a Wilson loop surrounding the cylinder along the first column, which is akin to the periodic boundary condition of the clean Ising model without disorder. For this vacuum state, the typical scaling dimension of the m-vortex determines the typical correlation between two far separated m-vortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It can be deduced from the energy cost of threading an mvortex through the hole of the long cylinder, which pulls a semi-infinite long line defect through the cylinder, see the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a) for a schematic, equivalent to changing the boundary condition from periodic to antiperiodic. From the perspective of the 2D mixed state, this energy cost is equivalent to the relative entropy between the even and odd sector of the mixed state, when the density matrix is divided into two blocks according to the absence or presence of an m-vortex through the hole of the cylinder:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">F 1 -F 0 L y = -∑ em P (em) ln P 1 (em) P (em) ∝ 2π∆ m L x ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where P 1 (em) is the partition function with an extra m-vortex through the cylinder hole, given the same em configuration in the bulk. The additional entropy scales with a universal scaling dimension of the vortex, which from our numerical simulations summarized in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a), can be extracted to be ∆ m ≈ 0.156 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> .</p><p>Due to the self-duality, the scaling dimension of the e-vortex in the bulk shall be identical to ∆ e = ∆ m .

Then the typical spin-spin correlation function in the bulk is governed by the same scaling dimension ∆ e . We also compute the scaling dimension of the first excitation in the even sector, which is found to be ∆ ϵ ≈ 0.259(1) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lyapunov spectrum</head><p>Besides looking solely at the finite-size scaling of the vacuum energy, Eq.

In particular, we compare clean Ising, Nishimori, and the weak self-dual criticality, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> below. As a consequence of the underlying 10-fold way <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">124]</ref> (Altland-Zirnbauer) symmetry class D, the single-particle spectrum has particlehole symmetry, being symmetric with respect to the zero energy level. The even and odd sectors are labeled by the black and red colors. The spectrum becomes denser upon increasing the system size L x , which can be viewed as forming two "bands" in the thermodynamic limit where the gap closes. The vacuum of the CFT is obtained by fixing the even sector and filling the lower band. Pumping an m-vortex through the cylinder hole traps a Majorana mode, drawing two levels from the band into the middle of the "gap". They lie at exactly zero energy for the clean Ising critical point, resulting in a two-fold degeneracy of the many-body spectrum due to the Majorana zero mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. However, they split in the Nishimori critical state, which we attribute to the hybridization with the background m-vortices in the bulk. For Nishimori we numerically verify that ∆ m ≈ 0.341 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, which roughly agrees with the scaling dimension 2π∆ m /L x ≈ 0.691(2)π/L x reported in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">137]</ref>, see Appendix A 3 for more details. For the weak self-dual critical state with not only proliferated m-vortices but also proliferated e-vortices, the midgap modes appear to converge to the zero levels, restoring the Majorana zero modes. Consequently, the many-body spectrum exhibits a double degeneracy in the odd sector akin to the clean Ising critical state, see Appendix A 3.</p></div>

Upon close inspection of the scaling behavior at the boundary phase transition upon introducing the noise, we find that its universality qualitatively changes immediately, indicating an RG flow from self-dual criticality to Nishimori as we will discuss in the following.

For example, for a pure state |ψ(em)⟩⟩ = |ψ(em)⟩ ⟨ψ(em)| its Choi state is simply a tensor product of the two states, which can be further glued by the noise Kraus operators, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>(a) for schematic.

The intra-layer solid bond originates from the pure state Eq. 2, and the interlayer dashed bond is glued by the noisy Kraus operators, see Appendix Sec. A 4 for derivation. The trace of the original physical qubits is equivalent to an overlap with a Bell state between the ket and bra: trρ = ⟨⟨Bell|ρ⟩⟩, while the purity becomes the norm of the Choi state: trρ 2 = ⟨⟨ρ|ρ⟩⟩. Thus the corresponding Born's probability is also accordingly distorted by the noise: P (em) = ⟨⟨Bell|ρ(em)⟩⟩ = ∑ e ′ P (e ′ |e)P (e ′ m).</p><p>It is important to note that the effective 2D statistical model thus becomes a bilayer Ising model, where the noise probability tunes the interlayer Ising coupling, and the random measurement outcome injects vortices to both layers. The (1+1)D dynamics is thus a quantum ladder of Ising spins or Majorana fermions, with interchain interactions beyond the noninteracting fermion regime. Explicitly, in the language of the statistical mechanics model described in Eq.

A small value of p s amounts to RGrelevant fermion interactions which break statistical ('weak") KW symmetry, while these fermion interactions are numerically found RG-irrelevant in the vicinity of the infrared Nishimori point at p s = 1/2. The lack a Gaussian Majorana representation for 0 &lt; p s &lt; 1/2 also implies that numerical calculations (e.g. of the Neumann coherent information, etc.) are generically hard to perform for those values of p s . However, we can turn to a Born measurement average of the second Rényi coherent information by adapting Eq.

Its expectation value can be efficiently calculated by our tensor network representation <ref type="bibr">[147]</ref>, see Appendix Sec. A 4 for details. For a generic mixed quantum state, the location of the phase transition in parameter space and its universality class could depend on the order of the Rényi quantity, as different copies of the density matrices are involved and are mapped to statistical models with different layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref>. However, in our case here, the limit p s = 0 is an em-trajectory-resolved pure state whose different Rényi entropies are related to different scaling operators within the same critical theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref>. Analogously, in the maximally noisy limit p s = 50%, it becomes an mtrajectory-resolved, fully dephased, diagonal density matrix, whose Rényi entropies all diverge, as in the p s = 0 case, at the same transition point <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">110]</ref>.

Indeed, the numerical exponents we compute in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> are consistent with those obtained for the Nishimori criticality in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">137,</ref><ref type="bibr">[148]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[149]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[150]</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1(c</ref>), for p s &gt; 0 and θ &gt; θ c , we expect the boundary state to be dephased in the thermodynamic limit into a classical glassy Ising-ordered mixed state. This is evidenced by the numerically computed noisy coherent information I c → 0 under finite-size scaling (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> in Appendix E). The onset of measurement noise leads to a dephasing effect that immediately collapses the logical qubit into a logical classical bit in thermodynamic limit. In the Majorana representation, it means the topological protected logical qubit composed of the two edge Majoranas is unstable against the (noise-induced) proliferation of e-vortices in spacetime. It does not contradict the topological protection because the e-vortices are highly non-local topological defects. If a bond measurement error is turned on in addition, the ordered phase and the Nishimori criticality survive until a finite threshold, as realized in a noisy digital quantum processor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>

This raises the question of whether there is a way to break the self-duality while preserving the purity of the trajectory-resolved Majoranas, which we will now address by considering a coherent deformation instead of incoherent noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Breaking self-duality by deformation</head><p>To break self-duality without breaking purity of each trajectory, one can introduce a bath to absorb the e-vortices, or to damp the Pauli X operator of the site qubits. To be concrete, we deform the quantum state by applying a finitedepth local non-unitary circuit exp(-η ∑ j (1 -X j )/2) onto the site qubits, before their measurement. This non-unitary gate has previously been denoted as a "wave function deformation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. If not directly implemented in a circuit this deformation can, in principle, also be realized as the ground state of a 2D Rokhsar-Kivelson type Hamiltonian <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[151]</ref>. Consequently, the statistical model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">9</ref>) picks up an additional weight factor</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">P (em) ′ ∝ Z(em) 2 × exp ⎛ ⎝ η 2 ∑ + ∏ ⟨ij⟩∈+ t ij ⎞ ⎠ ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>up to an em independent normalization constant such that ∑ em P (em) ′ = 1. Note that this extra term is reminiscent of a gauge coupling, with η endowing a mass to the e-vortex.</p><p>By tuning η from 0 to ∞, we can thereby control the density of the e-vortices, which completely vanish at η → ∞. This expression can alternatively be viewed as a "reweighting" of the post-measurement Born ensemble. The corresponding (1 + 1)D circuit is composed of a deterministic exp(β ′ X/2) and a monitored (non-deterministic) exp(±βZ j Z j+1 /2) imaginarytime evolution. However, we caution that the probability of the random gate exp(±βZ j Z j+1 /2) at a given time is not only conditioned upon the "past" but also the "future" of the (1 + 1)D evolution, which is computed by tracing out the whole (1 + 1)D spacetime sheet. For convenience we compactify the phase diagram within p η ∈ [0, 0.5] where η = ln 1+2pη 1-2pη . In the limit η → ∞, the e-vortices vanish, P (em) ′ ∝ P (m) ′ δ e,0 . In the absence of e, the m-dependent partition function P (m) ′ reduces to two random bond Ising layers that share the same m-vortex disor-der:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">P (m) ′ ∝ Z(m) 2 = ∑ σ,τ exp ⎛ ⎝ β 2 ∑ ⟨ij⟩ s ij (σ i σ j + τ i τ j ) ⎞ ⎠ = ∑ σ,τ ∏ ⟨ij⟩ [1 + tan 2 ( θ 2 ) σ i σ j τ i τ j + s ij tan( θ 2 )(σ i σ j + τ i τ j )] ,<label>(32)</label></formula><p>where we use the fact that tanh(β/2) = tan(θ/2), and in the second line we perform a high-temperature expansion. When the disorder is traced out, the s terms drop out, so we find the normalization constant of the Born probability to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">∑ m P (m) ′ ∝ ∑ στ exp[tanh -1 tan 2 (θ) ∑ ⟨ij⟩ σ i σ j τ i τ j ],</formula><p>which is a non-random Ising model describing the disorder average correlations of the joint Ising spin σ ′ j ≡ σ j τ j . A transition point can then be readily determined via Kramers-Wannier duality</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">tan 2 ( θ c 2 ) = 1 1 + √ 2 ,</formula><p>which yields θ c /π = 0.364 . . .. Notably, at this critical point all disorder-independent operators are described by the unitary Ising CFT, which obeys this self-duality. For instance, the two-point correlation ⟨σ ′ i σ ′ j ⟩ ∼ |i -j| -1/4 because σ ′ picks up the scaling dimension 1/8 from the Ising CFT. Nevertheless, measurement-induced quenched randomness (which also breaks self-duality) causes (random) quantum trajectory resolved quantities to be no longer described by simple unitary Ising CFT, which is the reason why we have dubbed this critical theory "Ising+" theory. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>(b), the critical length exponent ν = 1.00(5) extracted from coherent information agrees with that of the simple Ising CFT. If one looks into the entanglement entropy scaling of the (1+1)D quantum state formed by the joint spins, σ ′ j , or its ground state energy scaling, one would recover the central charge 1/2. In contrast, the measurement-averaged entanglement entropy for our quantum state is expressed in terms of τ spins alone, which yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">c vN ent | η=∞ = 0.310(2) ,</formula><p>which is a universal number that is not captured by the unitary Ising CFT. Besides, the normalization condition ∑ m P (m) ′ = 1 ensures that this critical point has vanishing central charge following Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">13</ref>).</p><p>Properties characteristic of quenched disorder (including the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical measurements, governed by the Born-rule distribution) are described by derivatives with respect to replicas, analogous to the effective central charge -just for different observables. (See, e.g., Ref. 110.) For instance, when formulated within the replica formalism, c vN ent | η=∞ = 0.310(2) above should be a derivative with respect to N as N → 1 of the corresponding replicated boundary condition changing ("twist") operator correlation function computed with N replicas; this is needed to generate an average of a logarithm in the entropy. The result c vN ent = 0.310( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">2</ref>) comes from the extra (N -1) replicas and the derivative.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>(b)(c), when deviating from the η = ∞ limit, ν and c ent quickly cross over to the exponents for the self-dual criticality. This again indicates an RG flow, now from Ising+ criticality to self-dual criticality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Strong to weak self-dual symmetry</head><p>If we further add a mass term to not only the e but also the m-vortices, we can maintain the self-dual symmetry while suppressing both e and m on equal footing.

In the limit p γ = 1/2, γ = ∞, all e and m vortices are suppressed and our mixed-state self-dual criticality reduces to the non-random Ising criticality, whose (1+1)D quantum state exhibits self-duality as a strong symmetry KW |ψ⟩| γ=∞ = |ψ⟩| γ=∞ , up to boundary condition terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[152]</ref>. This can be visualized in the Majorana representation where the state inherits the Majorana translation symmetry from the Majorana quantum circuit. For any finite p γ , the self-duality is respected and the point at θ = π/4 remains always critical, distinct from the deformation critical line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1(c</ref>). Therefore we sit at θ = π/4 and perform our Born sampling computation for the Born-averaged entanglement entropy to obtain the scaling exponents c vN ent as a function of p γ . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>(d), the finite-size fit c vN ent for the critical point closer to the clean Ising significantly drift upwards, while that closer to the mixed critical point converges faster. This indicates a crossover from the unitary Ising CFT, with strong self-dual symmetry, to the mixed state self-dual criticality, with only weak self-dual symmetry. For the measurement-version of the Cho-Fisher model at hand the RG flow is thus towards decreasing mass, i.e. flowing from pure Ising to the KW-self dual point. Note that this is the opposite direction of the RG flow within the conventional Cho-Fisher model in the N → 0 replica limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>, which is schematically shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2(f)</ref>.</p></div>

Putting together all the numerical evidence, one arrives at a flow within the mixed-state critical line from Ising+, to self-dual criticality, and finally towards Nishimori criticality. In other words, when noise sets in, every fixed point could flow to Nishimori criticality -elevating it to a remarkably stable universality class in this context. This adds to the mounting evidence that Nishimori criticality might be an ubiquitous phenomenon in the quantum dynamics of monitored cluster states -it naturally arises from Born's rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it emerges both in the presence of incoherent noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and coherent deformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> as well as when both are present simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

It is interesting that in the language of the non-interacting fermion description of the KW self-dual point this noise amounts to an interaction amongst the Majorana fermions during the crossover, while the two endpoints of the RG flow, the ultraviolet KW self-dual as well as the infrared Nishimori critical point, are both described in terms of non-interacting fermion systems.</p><p>Relationship with measurements performed on quantum critical ground states</p><p>The type of (1+1)D systems we discuss in the present paper belong to the setups appearing in the context of measurement induced phase transitions (MIPT) in deep 1D quantum circuits <ref type="bibr">[78-81, 110, 111, 153, 154]</ref>. The systems we discuss are a particular (e-and m-) measurement-only <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[155]</ref> version of those, that surround the key question of weak self-duality symmetry, and which we write in the formulation of the mixed state of Eq. 3 in 2D space. In these setups measurements are performed in the 2D bulk spacetime of the quantum circuit. In such a circuit, including at the MIPT, the 2D bulk lacks space and time translational invariance in a fixed quantum trajectory. Only observables averaged over quantum trajectories (measurement outcomes) are described by (rather rich) nonunitary "random" CFTs. Examples are the self-dual and the Nishimori critical points discussed in this paper. The quantum state at the final time (the boundary) of the circuit is described by boundary critical properties of this "random" non-unitary bulk CFT [dictated by a particular scale-(and conformally)invariant boundary condition].</p><p>This setup should be contrasted with another (technically more tractable) type of measurement setups that has been discussed in the more recent literature, where measurements are performed on a quantum critical ground state of a 1D translationally invariant critical Hamiltonian of a unitary (1+1)D CFT including, e.g., a gapless Luttinger liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[156]</ref> or a critical transverse field Ising model in the examples first discussed in the literature, with natural generalizations to higher dimensional analogs (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">157]</ref>). When formulated in path integral language in (1+1)D spacetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[156]</ref>, the quantum critical ground state is generated at the imaginary time τ = 0 time-slice by an infinite imaginary time evolution from infinity with the unitary CFT Hamiltonian. Measurements are performed only at this τ = 0 time-slice, representing a line-defect in (1+1)D space time. Away from the defect line, the 2D bulk of spacetime is completely translationally invariant. There are a number of variations of this setup, including e.g. those dis-cussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[158]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[161]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[162]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[163]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[164]</ref> to briefly mention only a small subset. In many cases, including those where uniform measurement outcomes are postselected, the defect is described by a perfectly unitary defect/boundary CFT (thus, in those cases, bulk and defect/boundary are both unitary). In cases where no postselection (or bias) of measurement outcomes on the quantum critical ground state is performed, a defect can appear that itself needs to be described by non-unitary ('random') "measurement-dominated" defect/boundary fixed point CFT (exhibiting scaling behavior whose richness is qualitatively similar to that exhibited at general MITPs and by the systems discussed in the paper at hand). Examples of this are provided, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[164]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connection to decoherence transitions of the toric code</head><p>Our phase diagram, parametrized by a measurement angle θ, describes the maximal decoherence limit of the toric code phase diagram of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> which discusses a weak measurement / imperfect teleportation / Pauli noise channel, whose theory is described, as mentioned, by the symmetry class D NLSM with target space SO(2N )/U (N ) with theta term in the (N → 1)-replica limit. The RG flow, revealed in our work here, shows that the weak self-dual critical state of the projectively measured toric code immediately flows to the Nishimori critical lines when the measurement strength is moved away from the projective limit (and turned into a weak measurement).</p><p>The self-dual decoherence here is due to the non-Clifford Kraus operator ρ → ρ + Z+X √ 2 ρ Z+X √ 2 , which involves some terms like XρZ that create m vortices in the ket space but e vortices in the bra space, contributing to off-diagonal elements of the density matrix in the anyon basis. This should be distinguished from the self-dual Clifford noise with both bitflip and phase-flip with the same probabilities: ρ → (1-p) 2 ρ+ p(1-p)XρX +p(1-p)ZρZ +p 2 Y ρY ), which is purely block diagonal in the anyon basis. The latter case results in a trivial state at p = 50%, separated from the toric code by a decoupled Nishimori×Nishimori transition at p c ≈ 10.9%, as the statistical model can be factorized into two independent RBIM along the Nishimori line. The physical reason for the factorization is that the e and m vortices always appear in pairs in both the ket and the bra space at the same location, with trivial braiding statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref>. Similarly, the Clifford depolarizing noise is also mapped to the Nishimori transition of a random bond Ashkin Teller model <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[165]</ref>. It is interesting to note that another way of Clifford self-dual decoherence by proliferating the fermions with Kraus operator Z r X r+(1/2,1/2) can lead to a non-critical intrinsic mixed state topological order <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[166]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[168]</ref> at the maximal decoherence limit.</p><p>Previously, an (N → 0)-replica limit was discussed in randomly deforming the toric code <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[169]</ref>, while the (N = 2)replica case was discussed more recently in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">129]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-unitary measurement-based quantum computation</head><p>On a conceptual level, one way to think about the relation between bulk and boundary states is within the framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. There, a 2D bulk cluster state serves as a (short-range) entanglement resource for a deep (1 + 1)D quantum circuit -propagating along one the two space dimensions instead of a real time dimension [89-93] -to prepare (compute) a nontrivial (1+1)D quantum state. The universality of MBQC guarantees that any pure state can be prepared, in this way, at the boundary of a cluster state by an effective deterministic (1+1)D unitary circuit with sufficient space resource and classical communication. What we discuss here is a seemingly very different setting with an effective circuit that is probabilistic nonunitary <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">96]</ref> and leads to a mixed state <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">140]</ref>. But if one thinks of MBQC as a measurement-based approach to implement conventional unitary state preparation (quantum annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[170]</ref>), then one can cast our setting as a generalization of MBQC to non-unitary state preparation. This in turn points to a much broader application landscape of MBQC, as one can now imagine to prepare entangled mixed-states of matter that have no counterpart in the pure-state framework.</p></div>

An optimal decoder is one that can correct the whole SW-SSB phase at t &gt; π/8 with glassy long-range order into an SSB phase with long-range order. Such a decoder would leave the KW self-dual critical location invariant, and could possibly preserve the self-duality at the transition point, turning our weak self-dual criticality into a standalone (1 + 1)D mixed state:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">ρ Q = ∑ em U (em) |ψ(em)⟩⟨ψ(em)| Q U (em) † ,</formula><p>which should be amenable to near-term experimental probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Cylindrical boundary conditions</head><p>Here we discuss the boundary condition of the statistical model in the fermion representation when we place the 2D quantum state on a cylinder, i.e. implementing a periodic boundary condition along the X direction. If the measurement outcomes are post-selected to be positive, the statistical model is a clean 1+1D Ising model in the periodic boundary condition. And when the boundary term is twisted to be antiperiodic boundary condition, it excites an Ising primary field that costs energy. Nevertheless, in the presence of random bond disorder which breaks the translation symmetry, it is less clear to determine the periodic or anti-periodic boundary condition by directly looking at a given bond. Essentially, the boundary condition is related to the global flux pumped to the cylinder, which is still well defined in the disordered system. Consider the generators of the dynamics by taking into account a random bond, which under Jordan-Wigner transformation becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">s x,y Z x Z x+1 =s x,y iγ 2x γ 2x+1 , s x,y+ 1 2 X x =s x,y+ 1 2 iγ 2x-1 γ 2x ,<label>(A2)</label></formula><p>where at the boundary γ 2Lx+1 = -P γ 1 . Here there are two independent global quantum numbers</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">W = ∏ x,y=1 s x,y = ±1 , P = Lx ∏ j=1 X j = Lx ∏ j=1 iγ 2j-1 γ 2j = ±1 ,<label>(A3)</label></formula><p>where W determines the global flux pumped through the cylinder being 0 or π, and P specifies the parity of the spin or the fermion. A schematic of the two sectors distinguished by the global flux is illustared below</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">m m m m m W = + 1 W = -1 ,</formula><p>where the bulk configurations are kept the same. In the clean 1+1D Ising, the vacuum state lies in W = +1 , P = +1 and the lowest excited Ising primary field lies at W = +1 , P = -1, which has a dual counterpart, i.e. a domain wall excitation that twists the boundary condition W = -1 , P = +1 with the same scaling dimension 1/8. This degeneracy is related to the exact zero modes when the fermion is placed at periodic boundary condition such that its momentum can take 0 value. In the disordered system, the global flux that the fermion experiences is determined by -W P taking into account the flux induced by the random bond disorder and the opposite of the fermion parity. Once the boundary condition is fixed, the state is further divided into the two sectors determined by P . Technically, we will perform the Born measurements to get the Born ensemble as a grand canonical ensemble of the global flux, and then we divide the ensemble according to W = ±1, and fill the "Fermi sea" of the single-particle fermion eigenenergy levels to get the many-body state energy of the even fermion parity P = +1 in the eigen-fermion basis (caution that the fermion parity of the eigenmodes could differ from the original fermion modes [148] by a fixed sign). Then we can generate the many-body Lyapunov spectrum of even parity by increasing the double number of eigen-fermion modes, and that of the odd parity P = -1 by increasing an odd number of eigen-fermion modes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Lyapunov spectrum</head><p>Akin to the numerical approach to Chalker-Coddington network models in Ref.</p><p>[148], we evolve the (1+1)D quantum chain with 2L x Majorana fermions up to long times L y ≫ L x , which relaxes to a "steady" state, getting rid of the temporal boundary effect. In order to extract the universal bulk information, we discard the initial dynamics at early times, and perform statistics for the norm change of each fermion mode from now on. After a layer of gates, L x independent, normalized fermion modes linearly evolve to a set of un-normalized fermion modes, whose norms change by a factor r n for n = 1, . . . , L x in descending order. Numerically, r n is the diagonal element of the R matrix after the QR decomposition for the transfer matrix composed by a layer of gates. Here Q is the orthogonal matrix and R is the upper triangular matrix according to the standard linear algebra convention. In numerical practice, the transfer matrix of a layer can be further decomposed to smaller chunk of gates in order to suppress the rounding error when L x is large. r n can be treated as a random variable that fluctuates as time evolves. The typical average ϵ n = -ln r n for n = 1, ..., L x can be interpreted as the single-particle fermion energies of the (1+1)D quantum chain. Back to the second quantization picture, the many-body energies, or the Lyapunov exponents are</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">E m = 1 2 Lx ∑ n=1 ν n ϵ n ∝ 2π L x (∆ m - c Casimir 12 ) + . . . ,<label>(A4)</label></formula><p>where ν n = ±1 specifies the parity of the n-th eigenfermion mode, and by enumerating all the possibilities we have m = 1, ⋯, 2 Lx many-body eigen-energy levels. Here the manybody levels can be further divided according to the global fermion parity. The spacetime bulk of the evolution as a transfer matrix converges to ∏ y M (y) = ∑ m e -EmLy |E m ⟩⟨E m | [148]. Consequently, the 1D quantum ground state energy E 0 dominates in the limit L y ≫ L x in contributing to the 2D free energy (Shannon entropy of the measurement record) according to F = E 0 L y +. . .. The excitations E m -E 0 ∝ 2π∆ m /L x are expected to obey a scaling according to the underlying CFT, and due to the state-operator correspondence, their energy gaps capture certain operator correlation functions in spacetime. We have performed such calculations for the self-dual critical theory for different system sizes, resulting in the "spectra" of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>, where both Ising and Nishimori criticality are also included for comparison. The first column of the data plots lists the vacuum energy density in the even sector. The second column is the domain wall energy, obtained by the energy difference between the ground states of the even sector and the odd sector. The third column is the dimensionless many-body energy Lyapunov spectrum normalized by the width of the cylinder L ≡ Lx. These levels are obtained by filling the energy levels of the single-particle fermion modes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>, and they are shifted by a constant such that the ground state level lies at 0. For the spectrum, the black levels with squared markers are for antiperiodic -W P = -1 boundary conditions of the fermions, which are composed by the periodic spin chain in the even parity sector (W, P ) = (+, +) or the antiperiodic spin chain in the odd parity sector (W, P ) = (-, -); the red levels with circle markers include (W, P ) = (+, -) and (W, P ) = (-, +). The three rows are Ising, Nishimori and weak self-dual, respectively. Here clean Ising is for benchmarking, which exhibits the correct c = 1/2 for Casimir energy and ∆ (σ,σ) = 1/8 for the Ising primary field, and ∆ (ϵ, 1) = 1/2 for the fermion primary field. The sound velocity or the spacetime anisotropy factor is found to be 1 from the clean Ising benchmark, which is consistent with the fact that we work in spacetime isotropic lattice model instead of the continuously weak monitoring limit. For Nishimori we find E1 -E0 ∝ 2π/L * 0.341 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with sizes up to L = 30, which roughly agrees with Merz and Chalker's ∝ 0.691(2)π/L from the scaling dimension of the vortex-vortex correlation with fermion calculation of sizes up to L = 22 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and the estimated window in the figures in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">137]</ref>.</p></div>

(b) 2D classical statistical model with defect strings pulled by the e and m-vortices. The red defect string runs along the dual lattice and flips the sign of the Ising coupling from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic coupling, while the blue defect string stretches along the original lattice and inserts an Ising spin operator at the end of the string (the location of the e-vortex) to the Boltzmann weight changing its sign. Both strings can fluctuate across the lattice by gauge transformation, and do not change the gauge invariant partition function that is determined only by the e and m locations.

An external observer "eavesdrops", attempting to recover the logical information -with the coherent information reflecting the success of this recovery (with Ic = ln 2 indicating perfect recovery). The solid vertical line indicates the critical point θc = 0.251(1)π (fitted via the data collapse shown in the lower right inset), which agrees with the exactly known self-dual location π/4 within its error bar. In our numerical computation, 100 ∼ 1000 independent m configurations are sampled and 1000 Monte Carlo sweeps for e configurations are performed. For θ &lt; 0.2π, we initiate from e-vortex-free for Monte Carlo sampling, while for θ &gt; 0.2π we initiate from random vortex configurations.</figDesc></figure>

The global Ising symmetry of the network guarantees that⟨0| ρ R |0⟩ = ⟨1| ρ R |1⟩ and ⟨0| ρ R |1⟩ = ⟨1| ρ R |0⟩.The resultant coherent information, equal to the entropy of R, is determined by the absolute ratio | ⟨0| ρ R |1⟩ / ⟨0| ρ R |0⟩ |, which is simply the expectation value of inserting a domain wall defect.</figDesc></figure>

Characterization of the self-dual critical theory via the effective central charge and entanglement scaling at the point θc = π/4. For the system placed on a cylinder, we label the decohered bulk as "Charlie" (C) and the two segments of the bipartition of the boundary quantum chain as "Alice" (A) and "Bob" (B). (a) The Shannon entropy density of Charlie is equal to the free energy density of the classical statistical model (10), which is governed by the effective central charge c Casimir = 0.447(1). Inset: twisting the boundary condition yields the scaling dimension of the vortex operator being ∆m = 0.156(1). For comparison, the black line in the inset shows the scaling dimension ∆ϵ = 0.259(1) of the first excitation without the twist i.e. in the even sector. The numerical sampling is performed for long cylinder of sizes Lx = 6 -30 and Ly = 100Lx with 30, 000 Monte Carlo samples, where the energy density is extracted deep in the bulk. (b) The von Neumann entropy of Alice conditioned upon Charlie scales logarithmically with the chord length, from which we extract the prefactor c vN ent = 0.795(1) as the scaling dimensions of the boundary twist operator. To show the data collapse, we further subtract the half-cut entropy: ∆S vN ≡ S vN (l) -S vN (l = Lx/2) to get rid of the Lx dependence. The numerical calculation was performed for cylinder of sizes up to Lx = 512 and Ly ≥ 2Lx in periodic spatial boundary condition, with 2, 000 Monte Carlo sweeps for Lx = 512 and 500, 000 sweeps for Lx = 8 -32.</figDesc></figure>

Each layer denotes one tensor network as the spacetime evolution of the (1 + 1)D quantum state, subjected to random eand m-vortices. The site measurement noise ps blurs the e-vortex configuration, the deformation pη absorbs the e-vortices to the bath, while the coherent deformation pγ absorbs the eand m-vortices together, maintaining the self-duality.

At ps = 50% the Nishimori critical point, ν = 1.65<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, cvN ent = 0.421(5) based on our calculation of sizes up to Lx = 32.

At pη = 0.5 the Ising+ critical point, ν = 1.00(5), c vN ent = 0.310(2). The data is computed by finite size scaling of size Lx = 4, 8, 16, 32, whose data collapse is shown in Appendix Sec. E.

Numerical computation for the domain wall energy, ground state energy and the spectrum for the many-body states in the second quantization picture, comparing Ising, Nishimori, and weak self-dual critical states. The system size ranges Lx = 6 ∼ 30.The first column of the data plots lists the vacuum energy density in the even sector. The second column is the domain wall energy, obtained by the energy difference between the ground states of the even sector and the odd sector. The third column is the dimensionless many-body energy Lyapunov spectrum normalized by the width of the cylinder L ≡ Lx. These levels are obtained by filling the energy levels of the single-particle fermion modes in Fig.5, and they are shifted by a constant such that the ground state level lies at 0. For the spectrum, the black levels with squared markers are for antiperiodic -W P = -1 boundary conditions of the fermions, which are composed by the periodic spin chain in the even parity sector (W, P ) = (+, +) or the antiperiodic spin chain in the odd parity sector (W, P ) = (-, -); the red levels with circle markers include (W, P ) = (+, -) and (W, P ) = (-, +). The three rows are Ising, Nishimori and weak self-dual, respectively. Here clean Ising is for benchmarking, which exhibits the correct c = 1/2 for Casimir energy and ∆ (σ,σ) = 1/8 for the Ising primary field, and ∆ (ϵ, 1) = 1/2 for the fermion primary field. The sound velocity or the spacetime anisotropy factor is found to be 1 from the clean Ising benchmark, which is consistent with the fact that we work in spacetime isotropic lattice model instead of the continuously weak monitoring limit. For Nishimori we find E1 -E0 ∝ 2π/L * 0.341(1) with sizes up to L = 30, which roughly agrees with Merz and Chalker's ∝ 0.691(2)π/L from the scaling dimension of the vortex-vortex correlation with fermion calculation of sizes up to L = 22<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and the estimated window in the figures in Ref.<ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">137]</ref>.</figDesc></figure>

(a) Schematic: the green dashed line corresponds to the spacetime isotropic case we study in the main text, which locks β ′ /2 to the KW dual counterpart of β/2 because we assume a uniform measurement angle θ for the bond qubits in the bulk, which corresponds to an isotropic spacetime in the effective statistical model. As shown in the box, if we allow the measurement angle for the horizontal bond qubit θ ′ to be independently tuned, then we can tune β and β ′ independently, moving away from the spacetime isotropic line. Then a longer cylinder is needed to reach a steady (1+1)D quantum state.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Born-average Rényi entropies</head><p>One can generalize Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> to the Born average of the n-th order Rényi entropies:</p><p>Note that, in contrast, the Rényi entropies of the mixed state go beyond the Born average and correspond to the higher replica limits described by different critical theories at different critical locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the Rényi entanglement scaling dimensions here clearly deviate from the Calabrese-Cardy formula for unitary CFT, where the central charge is the only fingerprint that governs all the Rényi entanglement entropy. In contrast, here our numerical results show that there are at least two independent exponents c vN ent = 0.795(1) and c (∞) ent = 0.484 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. From another perspective, given the limited knowledge about non-unitary CFTs, it is surprising to see that only two parameters are sufficient in describing all the Rényi entropies, which also appear in the case of entanglement transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref>. </p><p>ent , which is should be compared with the Calabrese Cardy formula for unitary CFT c</p><p>A similar scaling with Rényi indices was observed in the context of measurement-induced phase transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref>. The calculation uses parameters Lx = 512 and Ly = 1024 with periodic spatial boundary conditions, performing 2000 Monte Carlo sweeps using the stochastic fermion evolution method. For Lx ranging from 8 to 32, 1000 Monte Carlo sweeps are performed for the e configuration, conditional upon each of the 500 m configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C: Comparison with continuous weak measurement</head><p>Here we verify the basic notion of universality -that the critical exponent does not depend on the microscopic details such as spacetime anisotropy, or whether the measurement is which also satisfies</p><p>as physically required for the consistency of the quantum measurement. Using this Gaussian distribution function instead of the bimodal distribution, our numerical computation for a small size (Fig. <ref type="figure">9c</ref>) does not show significant deviation from 0.795(1) reported for the spacetime isotropic case for size L x = 512.</p><p>Appendix D: Central charge of Ising+</p><p>Here we discuss the normalization issue of the Ising+ model. In our main text we normalize the probability function of disorder:</p><p>where we denote Z Ising = ∑ m Z(m) 2 with Ising coupling constant tanh -1 tan 2 θ as defined in the main text. Z(m) 2 can be represented as a tensor network or a CC network, same as Z Ising . However, it is not straightforward that Z(m) 2 /Z Ising can be represented as a network, because inverting a network -1/Z Ising is a highly nonlocal nonlinear operation. In our numerical CC network calculation (as a bilayer tensor network), the transfer matrix generates Z(m) 2 only, without the normalization factor Z Ising . Therefore the quenched disorder averaged free energy that the Majorana fermion picks up is contributed by two terms:</p><p>where F Ising+ is the Shannon entropy of the disorder that scales with c Casimir , the effective central charge for Ising+ that we define in this paper. And F Ising is the free energy of the clean Ising model with central charge 1/2. Therefore, the Majorana fermion sees a combination of c Casimir for Ising+ and 1/2 from clean Ising. The normalization of the partition function subtracts the 1/2 contribution. More generally, for N replicas,</p><p>the unnormalized version of the free energy picks up a background term with the Ising free energy linearly coupled to the replica index N . Thus taking the derivative with N yields a replica-independent constant contribution originating from the critical Ising CFT. This is why in our definition the Ising+ has central charge 0 rather than 1/2:</p><p>Lyapunov spectrum. Since we do not have a transfer matrix for Z(m) 2 /Z Ising , we cannot define its Lyapunov spectrum. Instead, the Lyapunov spectrum that we compute corresponds to the unnormalized model described by partition function Z(m) 2 = tr(T Ly ), where T is the transfer matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix E: Supplementary data for finite-size data collapse</head><p>We close the manuscript by providing supplementary data for the critical states along the three critical line by tuning the e-mass (Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>), e-noise (Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>), and em-mass (Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>), respectively.</p></div>			</div>
