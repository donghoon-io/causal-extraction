<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The northeastern region of Thailand has the largest area planted to rice in the kingdom and produces more than one third of the total national output. But 85% of the 5.2 million ha of rice in this region are cultivated under rainfed conditions, with a single crop per year. The low physical productivity (average paddy yield is 1.8 t ha -1 ) of the paddies is mainly due to the combined effects of low water-holding and infertile coarse-textured soils, erratic rainfall distribution (1200 mm/year mainly from May to October) and low input use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Jintrawet, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Somrith, 1997)</ref>. But for more than 7 millions farm workers living in this most populated region of the kingdom (21 millions out of a national total of 65 millions, regional population density of 126 inhabitants/km 2 ), small-scale RLR farming has been a way of living for centuries with an average size of land holding of 3.2 ha <ref type="bibr">(OAE, 2007)</ref>. Rice is the staple food crop of both dominating Lao Issan (who eat glutinous rice, mainly RD6 variety) and Khmer (who eat non glutinous rice, mainly KDML105 variety) people who live mainly in the lower sub-region where paddies cover some 80% of the area. Rice is grown on undulating land made of adjacent mini catchments composed of well-drained upper, medium and flood-prone lower paddies that are usually planted to different RLR varieties with different duration cycles. RLR is also a major economic crop because of the local production of renowned strains of aromatic rices that find their way to international markets. Paddy sales could represent some 20% of the households total cash income. Under very constraining soil-water conditions, the grain quality of these aromatic jasmine cultivars is the main comparative advantage allowing to secure higher farm gate price for paddy that partly compensate the average low yields and single crop per year. Seed quality is important to maximize this comparative advantage.</p><p>In this farming context, RLR varietal and seed management is complex and involves decisions on varietal choice, desired degree of agrobiodiversity, and the procurement of good quality seed. In recent years, facing the inadequate supply of good quality seed of dominant RLR varieties, the Thai rice seed system (RSS) has been undergoing profound changes, especially the entry of different types of private seed producers (from large private companies like the CP Group to village level Community Seed Centers), and the subsequent increased adoption of a few recommended varieties (particularly KDML105, RD6 and the shorter duration non glutinous RD15) replacing hundreds of traditional cultivars exchanged among farmers. A growing number of diverse stakeholders interact in the RSS without knowing each other or coordinating their operations, and each of them having only a very incomplete understanding of how the whole system operates.</p><p>The main objective of this study was to test the use of participatory modelling to build a shared representation of rice varietal and seed management at the provincial scale with the main concerned stakeholders (different types of rice growers, extension agencies, cooperatives, public and private seed suppliers, and community seed production centres) in the major RLR producing province of Ubon Ratchathani in lower northeast Thailand. Based of this better understanding of the local RSS, the second objective was to implement this shared representation of the RSS into an agent-based model (ABM) used as a simulator to explore different possible future scenarios identified by the main stakeholders and to assess the ability of the RSS to meet farmers' demand and to adapt to its unpredictability under those different circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Vejpas et al. 2005)</ref>. In this paper, following a short presentation of the participatory modelling methodology and tools used in this case study, the emphasis is on the description of the ABM co-designed with the local actors and its use to simulate scenarios. The paper ends with a discussion of the results and a presentation of the future perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">MATERIAL AND METHODS</head><p>The so-called Companion Modelling <ref type="bibr">(ComMod, www.commod.org )</ref> approach was used to facilitate the dialogue among the RSS stakeholders and the exchange of knowledge and points of view about the seed system because it is a proven methodology to set-up and manage inclusive, open, and highly interactive collaborative modelling processes <ref type="bibr">(Bousquet &amp; Trebuil, 2005)</ref>. ComMod processes are iterative but evolving and rely on different kinds of models (conceptual, role-playing games, agent-based ones) to stimulate the interactions among stakeholders. These models are co-designed, validated, played or simulated with stakeholders and evolve according to their changing needs following the acquisition of new knowledge or change in the context.</p><p>The main phases of the implemented ComMod process were as follows:</p><p>-A preliminary sample description survey at the farm level was carried at the provincial level, among 258 farmers in 25 districts, to gather baseline data on the spatial, quantitative, and qualitative distribution of farmers' needs of rice seed in every district of Ubon Ratchathani province. In particular, it provided a picture of the heterogeneity of farmer' situations regarding access to seed suppliers, the districts located in the northern part of the province having a more diverse choice compared to the more remote southern ones. Representatives of key organizations involved in the RLR see system were also interviewed to provide information of the activities of different kinds of seed suppliers and to sensitize them to participate in the ComMod process.</p><p>-Short workshops with selected seed producers: To understand the rice seed system structure and functioning at the provincial scale, a series of meetings were organized with representatives of the main seed producing organizations. For most of them, it was the first opportunity to meet and discuss the RSS issue. During these meetings, a conceptual model of the seed system was built based on the knowledge provided by the participants. This knowledge base was displayed on the screen as a set of Unified Modelling Language (UML) class and activity diagrams to be gradually enriched and validated by them. After several sessions, an agreement on the structure and functioning of the provincial RSS was reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Vejpas et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>-In the next phase, this conceptual model was translated into two complementary roleplaying games:</p><p>(i) the fist one was used with farmers at different locations (according to a gradient of remoteness of their villages to seed suppliers) to validate the research team understanding of the generation of the demand for seeds at the village level. This gaming and simulation tool allowed to better understand the farmers' decision-making processes dealing with the selection and allocation of a combination of RLR varieties in their paddies, their seed management practices, and choice of seed suppliers.</p><p>(ii) the second gaming tool simulated the production and provision of seeds in a virtual province by various suppliers operating at the village, sub-district, district or whole province levels. These participatory modelling and simulation sessions were used to elucidate seed supplier practices, decision-making processes and interactions. This activity was instrumental in the validation of the conceptual model representing the relationships (or lack of) among the RSS stakeholders and the flow of different types of (foundation, stock and certified) seeds among them <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Vejpas et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>-Finally an autonomous Agent-Based Model (ABM) was built.</p><p>Participatory modelling and simulation of the rice seed system in Northeast Thailand Abrami G., <ref type="bibr">Vejpas, C., Bousquet, F., Trebuil, G.</ref> This ABM implemented under the CORMAS platform simulates the seed requirements from farmers and the allocation of seed from public and private suppliers to meet the demand for certified seeds of the two most popular glutinous (RD6) and non glutinous (KDML 105) rice varieties and is described extensively in the following section. It implements the conceptual models developed in the previous phases and runs simulations on a yearly time step and at the village, district, and provincial levels.</p><p>The ABM was instanciated on the specific case of the virtual province used during the second gaming workshops and presented to key stakeholders during a series of meetings and demos in their offices. The features and operating rules of the simulator were explained and discussed with representatives from the main seed suppliers to improve and gradually validate them. More particularly, the decision making rules concerning seeds quantity planning and allocation priorities were</p><p>The potential use of this simulator to help manage the current reform of the RSS (favouring a growing role for the private seed suppliers, especially the community seed centres) was also discussed. These potential users proposed possible future scenarios of interest to be simulated and assessed for such a purpose.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">1 The Conceptual models</head><p>The representation of the seed consumption (at the farm and village levels) and seed supply (from the village community to the provincial level -and even the national level regarding the provision of foundation seeds) systems are described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Vejpas et al. 2005)</ref>, but key findings from the conceptual modelling and role-playing game workshops are summarized in figures 1 and 2 showing the decision model for the choice of seed sources and suppliers at the farm level and the seed supply system at the provincial scale respectively. This conceptual model was used as a base for designing the initial version of the Agent-Based model. Whereas focus of the first phase of conceptual modelling and role-playing game was on the provincial seeds system as well as on the farmers scale, in this phase the focus was brought exclusively on the provincial seeds system. As a consequence, contract farmers and detailed farmers behaviors were not considered in this phase which focused on provincial seeds system flows and decision making. . A prototype was then use to hold workshops with the stakeholders where they discussed, refined and corrected the hypotheses displayed through the demonstration of the prototype. The result can be seen on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The diagram on the left is equivalent to the UML diagram of figure 2. The diagram on the right is the conceptual model such as it is implemented in the ABM : priorities and specification in seeds flows are specified, as well as the status of the stakeholders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Agent-Based Model</head><p>The way these multi-level models were merged into a single ABM integrating all the relevant scales of seed consumption, production and distribution is shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Overview</head><p>This ABM represents the Rainfall Lowland Rice (RLR) seeds system of North-East Thailand at the provincial scale. Only "active" stakeholders are represented (the fact that the decisions are taken by Bangkok institutions is not represented). Agents are RLR seeds system stakeholders that act from the Province level to the Farm level and that might have preferential relations between each others. These agents exchange and/or multiply seeds stocks from 2 varieties: a glutinous (RD6) and a non glutinous one (KDML105).</p><p>These agents hold roles in the seeds supply chain. They might be seed producers, middlemen or rice growers, respectively to each variety. These roles are connected through provider and customer links ranked with priorities. These links and their priorities depend on which stakeholder they are held by. One time step represents one year and reproduces the phases of one time step of the RPG : planning of needed quantities and orders, production or multiplication of seeds in stock from last year, treatment of orders and direct requests, seeds provision to farmers. From one year to the other, seeds production is adjusted on previous years and farmers demand is adjusted on paddy market prices. Seeds prices are not considered in the model as it was not considered as a determinant parameter for seeds supplier choice. The number of multiplication and origin of seeds is traced but only used marginally. The model can be described abstractly as follows: A resource is exchanged among a supply chain from producers to consumers. Consumption and production of the resource can happen only once a year. 1 producer only is able to produce a high quality resource in small quantities. Other producers multiply the resource they manage to get from the supply chain. Each time the resource is multiplied, its quality decreases. All stakeholders in the supply chain have preferences among their providers and customers. Each time step happens as following : 1. Planning: customers plan their demand and stakeholders establish their needs 2. Resource production 3. Resource supply : the resource is distributed accross the supply chain up to the customers 4. Assesment : customers assess supply and may change supplier 2.2.2. Entities and scales</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.1">Biophysical Entities</head><p>Seeds entity represents seeds stocks that circulate between the stakeholders. A seeds stock is described by :</p><p>a quantity, given in tons a variety. 2 varieties are available in the model : KDML (aromatic) and RD6 (glutinous). It is the 2 main RLR varieties that are recommended and produced by RRC. -a quality : FS (Foundation -produced from breeder seeds in RRC), SS (Stockproduced from FS), CS (Certified -produced from SS), or NC (non certified, produced from CS) -a source : the list of all its multipliers an age : the number of years since its last multiplication</p></div>

All aggregate spatial entities are AdministrativeArea. Each Cell belongs to a Tambon, that belong to an Amphoe, that belong to a Province. Amphoe are also characterized by their accessibility. In normal amphoes, farmers and farmers communities have access to the provincial public seeds producers (RRC and SC). In remote amphoes, a part of seeds renewal is done through informal exchanges between farmers.</p></div>

It is characterized by the up and down limit of paddy prices. Farmer individuals are represented by Farmer agents. In each tambon, their individual needs generate a global seeds demand. A Farmer updates his needs each year considering the proportion of rice varieties on its plots and whether he renews its seeds or not. This demand is attributed to a supplier. This supplier is attributed by initial conditions but it may change according to the farmer experience. Stakeholder is the generic entity representing the seed system stakeholders. These stakeholders are :</p><p>Participatory modelling and simulation of the rice seed system in Northeast Thailand Abrami G., <ref type="bibr">Vejpas, C., Bousquet, F., Trebuil, G.</ref> - -TambonFarmers : virtual entity aggregating demand and seeds distribution for the farmers of one Tambon. TambonFarmers defines n, the number of farmers in the tambon, as well as providersDistr which is the repartition of providers share within one tambon. Can get seeds from any stakeholder but RRC. In remote amphoes, no acces to SC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.4.">Supply Chain Roles</head><p>5 different roles in the seeds supply chain have been identified. These roles define the behaviors of the stakeholders in the seeds systems within the various supply chain processes. (needs planning, seeds production or multiplication, seeds supply, seeds use). These roles are :</p><p>-FSProducer : produces FS according to estimate needs and limiting capacity; supply FS to customers. Held by RRC -Multipliers : purchase FS or SS from providers, multiplies into SS or CS, supply production to customers. Held by SC, CSC, producing AC -MiddleMen : purchase seeds from providers, supply it to customers. Held by ST, BA, non producing AC and DAO. -RiceGrowers: purchase seeds from providers and use it for paddy. Held by TambonFarmers Supply Chain Roles are characterized by :</p><p>a variety they deal with. A stakeholder should have as many roles as varieties he is dealing with providers and customers ranked with priorities. Links are set up according to stakeholders and priorities are set up according to rules discussed with stakeholders and displayed in the parameters table in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.5.">Time Scales</head><p>The time step is 1 year for all entities. The year is separated in different phases (planning, production, distribution, estimation) where the entities may or may not act depending on their roles.</p><p>As stakeholders planning have to adjust on sales from an arbitrary initial value, a simulation is initialised first with a "blank" 20 years run so that the system gets to an equilibrium through stakeholders adjustments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.4.">Spatial Scales</head><p>The smaller spatial unit is the tambon (sub-district) and the grid represents a province.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Processes and Scheduling</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.1.">Biophysical Processes</head><p>The only biophysical processes in the model are held by FSProducer and Multiplier agents and concern seeds production and multiplication. They consist in applying a stochastic hazard on expected seeds production or multiplication values. Resulting seeds are put in their distributionStock.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.2.">Socio-economical processes</head><p>Paddy price evolution (Market) has been asserted as unpredictable: it consists in a series of randomly drawn values between the lower and upper limits identified with the stakeholders.</p><p>Farmers' seeds demand is calculated each year individually for each farmer. It depends on previous years seeds provision in that farmers demand for seeds when they get too old according to its own criterion (a fixed frequency) and renew their demand every year until it is satisfied. However the demand may be satisfied by informal exchanges. In consequence, a farmer's seeds demand results from his rice growing area, its seeds age, its seeds replacement frequency, its propensity to get seeds from other farmers, and its varieties distribution. Depending on market prices, farmers may raise their proportion of KDML and renew more seeds.</p><p>Farmers' supplier choice. Farmers may decide to get a new supplier when their current supplier does not succeed in delivering seeds, or delivers seeds which have been multiplied too much or coming from outside the system<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . There is a fixed set of suppliers that can be accessed by all the farmers within a tambon. We have chosen to implement the simplest possible set of hypotheses to represent the choice of a new supplier. This set of hypotheses is realistic enough and allows to test the dynamicity of the model but it would need to be refined to represent realistic dynamics. These hypotheses are : (1) seeds price has no impact on supplier choice (2) farmers assess their supplier on their reliability in answering a demand with adequate seeds (which have not been multiplied too much or coming from outside the system) (3) farmers assessment of a supplier is cumulative all along his life and a good assessment increases the chance to be chosen again (4) even with a bad assessment, it is always possible that a farmer choose a supplier again.</p><p>Seeds supply planning is performed by all supply chain actors and consists in making previsions on customers demand every beginning of year: the planned quantity is the objective quantity to get its distribution stock. There is 2 way of planning in the model : collecting information about customers needs and adjusting the prevision on this information (order based planning) or adjusting the prevision on previous years actual sales (adjusted planning). RRC and DAO have registered customers and practise order based planning. All the other one do not collect orders and adjust to previous sales. The depth of memory used can be adjusted.</p><p>Participatory modelling and simulation of the rice seed system in Northeast Thailand Abrami G., <ref type="bibr">Vejpas, C., Bousquet, F., Trebuil, G.</ref> Seeds purchase is performed by all supply chain actors except FSProducer. It consists in sending a direct request to a provider in order to get the planned quantity of seeds.</p><p>For Muliplier and MiddleMen agents, direct requests are sent to providers one after each other, following their priority ranking for the whole needed quantity of seeds, until this quantity has been purchased or the providers list is over. The offer of a provider is always accepted, and its answer is needed before sending the next direct request. Multiplier agents put received seeds in their productionStock, MiddleMen agents put received seeds in their distributionStock.</p><p>When it has completed its purchase, SC checks its productionStock. If plannedQuantity is not reached it transfers the needed quantity from its distributionStock to its productionStock.</p><p>For RiceGrower, the quantity of seeds to purchase is determined by the aggregated Farmers' seeds demand. If a supplier does not provide enough seed, farmers randomly drawn among its suppliers do not get seeds.</p><p>Seeds distribution is performed by all supply chain actors except RiceGrower. At the end of a "distribution round", the received direct requests are treated. If there is enough seeds in the distributionStock to satisfy all the direct requests, all the direct requests are answered with the requested seeds quantity. If not, the seeds are distributed using weights according to buyers priorities so that higher priority buyers get more seeds but that nobody gets nothing. If different qualities of seeds are available, best quality are given first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.3.">Description of scheduling</head><p>One time step is scheduled as followed: 1.</p><p>Step initialisation : surplus stocks are destroyed : distribution stocks are set to 0 2. Planning : Paddy price evolves with market; farmers set their demand; stakeholders plan their objectives recursively (the top producer asks their plans to all its customers who ask their plans to all their customers and so on until end customers. When a provider has received the answers from all its customers, it operates its planning (either order-based or adjusted) and answers all its providers and so on). The way these sessions are populated and sequences has been quite a delicate parameter of the model : it may greatly influence the simulation results and can only be a very rough approximation of the real seeds market sequencement. We've considered different possibilities but after a few sensitivity analysis, we've decided to Participatory modelling and simulation of the rice seed system in Northeast Thailand Abrami G., <ref type="bibr">Vejpas, C., Bousquet, F., Trebuil, G.</ref> use a slight enhancement of the sequencement represented during the game, which had already been validated by the stakeholder. The only difference with the game is that traders are second-order providers (they can provide seeds to other providers) and that some CSC may be provided by DAO, as we learnt during ABM sessions. 5. Assesment : farmers assess their suppliers and possibly choose a new one for the following year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.3</head><p>The prototype and the workshops 2.3.1. Workshops progress and ABM interface elements for interacting with the stakeholders</p><p>The workshops were designed so that the ABM demonstration could be used as a restitution support of our understanding of the system. The model structure and dynamics was explained step by step through the different viewpoints provided by the CORMAS interface. Special emphasis was put on data and hypothesis concerning the agents that represents the stakeholders attending the workshop. The stakeholders could react and complete or correct the model all along the demonstration. Then a debriefing was held in order to define what are the stakeholders expecting from the model. Providers and customers lists and priority levels can be modified at any time of the simulation through a dedicated interface. The procedure used during the demonstration was the following: the spatial elements of the interface are presented and explained; the different agents are shown within the territory they supply: are all the stakeholders represented? Is their spatial allocation right? ; for each agent, the supplying and buying links are shown: are all the links correct? Is there some links missing? Are the priorities right?; the simulation is run for a year step by step, showing the information and seeds exchange between the agents; simulation results figured as histograms are shown for a few years (figures 4 and 5). The model structure description was very efficient in definitively validating the stakeholders roles and relations. The histograms were very efficient in getting back on the hypothesis we made on agents decision-making about seeds distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Workshops main results</head><p>The workshops were very efficient in getting information gaps filled. In particular, the following elements of the model were extracted and validated from the workshops : validation and completion of stakeholder links and priorities, definition of the institutional status, impact of tambons remoteness, refinement of the seeds allocation function, hypotheses on farmers demand evolution with paddy market price, definitive choice of varieties, AC networks. 5 potential scenarios that could be explored with the ABM simulations were also defined :</p><p>-baseline scenario, in the current state of the model -institutional reform : merging of RRC and SC. This scenario is translated in the model by RRC providing seeds only to SC -decentralisation : number of CSC increases with institutional reform. This scenario is translated in the model by creating 1 CSC in each tambon.</p><p>-modernisation : all farmers get mechanized and renew their seeds every year -decentralisation + modernisation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Simulation results</head><p>The 5 scenarios were simulated with an identical random paddy price series and with and without farmers being able to change supplier. The model is always more efficient in delivering seeds to farmers without generating too much surplus when farmers are not able to change suppliers. The main reason is certainly that as one hypothesis being that farmers tend to prefer suppliers who deliver only province grew certified seeds, there are less farmers getting their seeds from AC which is giving a 100% success in the cases where suppliers are not fixed. There is no subsequent difference in the different scenarios, except the ones with modernisation where the demands are answered more efficiently. This is due to the fact that even if the demands are increasing, they are more stable, which makes the seed system stakeholders able to predict is correctly and answer it (figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). It can be surprising looking at the customers ratio evolution of the different suppliers that multipliers production and delivery to farmers is not rising when the demand is rising. This is due to the fact that the system has still not reach its full capacity (many farmers can work with SS obtained from DAO who obtained it easily from SC as its only concurrent which is AC is getting most of its provisions from its network as a pervert consequence of farmers adaptation) and that as multipliers production is driven by demand and demand is driven by suppliers reliability, AC and CSC never manage to increase significantly their customers numbers and indeed increase the number of seeds in the system by making new multiplications because their supply is not reliable enough (production hazards + completion by outside seeds) compared to DAO which is getting SS directly from DAO with a very high priority (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>).</p><p>The conclusion is that the hypotheses in the model allow representing faithfully a stable situation but are not good enough to represent a self adapting system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Knowledge integration from various sources and at different scales</head><p>The multi level ABM implemented in this process makes use of indigenous as well as expert and scientific knowledge about the local RSS. It also represents interactions between the formal seed production and distribution system operated by public and private agencies, and the village and farm levels more informal practices regarding the use of rice seeds.</p><p>While the RPG was very useful to communicate the contents of a conceptual model, to enrich and validate it with its end users, the ABM allows to run simulations at the provincial scale with out being limited by either the number of participating players (which is always limited to less than twenty in a RPG session), or the cost (time and cash) of a simulation.</p><p>Potentially, there is no restriction on the number of stakeholders that can be simulated with the ABM. However we chose to use in the ABM the same simplified setting as in the RPG where only 4 sub-districts are represented (there are around 300 in a province) for several reasons : (1) it made it possible to design an interface very similar to the representations used during the gaming workshops that would hence look familiar to the stakeholders and would allowed to keep on deepening the discussions started during these workshops (2) it kept the simulation simple and allowed to easily check what is happening at the level of specific sub-districts (3) it creates a gap between real world data and simulation that prevent users to focus on results and figures instead of focusing on processes and hypotheses. This last reason was particularly important as we did not want our partners to confuse our simulator with a decision-support tool.</p><p>Used in the workshops, the model did reach its goal of extracting and confronting stakeholders information. It was particularly efficient in giving direct feedback on the hypotheses validated by the stakeholder in the form of histograms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Limits and potential improvements of the ABM</head><p>From a more methodological point of view, modelling such a seed system leads to the representation of a very particular type of supply chain and so we could not find examples of simulations on which we could rely on in the operational systems literature :</p><p>-The production of certified seeds is a lengthy process while seed distribution occurs over a very short period of the year.</p><p>-Seed quality issues have to be taken into account during seed multiplication as seed quality is more important than seed price in the selection of a supplier by local farmers.</p><p>-Each stakeholder in the RSS thinks and acts at a very different scale.</p><p>The potential use of the simulator was as a tool for getting feedback on implications and potential unpredictable consequences of management options. The prototype that was developed in the time frame of the project only exhibits potential contributions of such a simulator. Developing this prototype into an operational tool would necessity a new round of interaction with stakeholders in order to identify focal aspects that should be deepened and collect further data and hypotheses. For instance the main limits are :</p><p>-the suppliers volume planning is only driven by the demand, may it be with perfect information (registered customers) or crude estimation on previous years. The consequence is that when farmers increase the demand on more reliable suppliers, the less reliable ones enter a positive feedback loop where they keep on reducing their volume planning as they keep on loosing customers. This is particularly true for seeds multipliers which volume planning is shifted by 1 year (time for producing the seeds). This results in a strong dependency to initial conditions (number of initial customers and initial score of a supplier) which does not look very realistic. It means that more information of main constraints and drivers of suppliers volume planning are needed.</p><p>-seeds producers cannot be as flexible as middlemen as they have constraints on the seeds production. At which rate are they able to increase or decrease their production capacity? Are there some upper and lower limits ? An important constraint on seeds producers dynamic that is not represented would be for instance the way contract farmers are contracted.</p><p>-farmers suppliers choice possibilities should not be homogeneous in a tambon. In reality they are driven strongly by accessibility to suppliers. It would be necessary to represent heterogeneities in terms of access to suppliers and information of the farmers.</p><p>-the simple situation should be upscaled to a situation with a number of stakeholders that would reflect the size orders of a province.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES</head><p>The model presented in this paper was built in partnership with local researchers, representatives of local public and private seed producing organizations, as well as different types of rice growers in Ubon Ratchatani province.

As a consequence, it seems that the behaviour providing the more stability while providing some dynamics possibility is when farmers change suppliers when they get off-type seeds but score them positively (which means I try to find a new supplier because this one is not providing top quality but it is still ok because it has a reliable supply).</p></div>
