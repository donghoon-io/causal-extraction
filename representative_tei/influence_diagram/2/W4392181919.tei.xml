<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) governance models have become increasingly complex due to the involvement of numerous independent agents, each with their own incentives and strategies. To effectively analyze these systems, we propose using Multi Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs) [9] as a powerful tool for modeling and studying the strategic interactions within DeFi governance. MAIDs allow for a comprehensive representation of the decisionmaking processes of various agents, capturing the influence of their actions on one another and on the overall governance outcomes. In this paper, we study a simple governance game that approximates real governance protocols and compute the Nash equilibria using MAIDs. We further outline the structure of a MAID in MakerDAO.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) governance protocols empower token holders to actively participate in shaping the future of the platform by voting on a variety of important decisions. These decisions can range from technical adjustments, such as parameter updates, to broader protocol improvements that impact the entire ecosystem. The process of deciding how to vote on a particular proposal is complex and influenced by multiple factors. Firstly, voter behavior is often shaped by the actions and decisions of other voters. This phenomenon, known as social influence or herding behavior, can significantly impact the outcome of votes as individuals may be swayed by the perceived consensus or the actions of influential stakeholders within the network. Secondly, external factors, such as market sentiment, play a critical role in shaping voter decisions. Market trends, news events, and the overall economic climate can affect how token holders perceive the implications of a proposal and thus influence their voting behavior. Understanding the dynamics of these voting games is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the system. For the analysis of such games, we propose to use Multi Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs). MAIDs combine the ideas of Bayesian Networks (BNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Influence Diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to describe decision problems related to multiple agents. MAIDs are graphical models used to represent decision-making scenarios involving multiple agents, each with their own objectives, beliefs, and actions. They extend the traditional influence diagram framework to accommodate the complexities of interactions and dependencies among multiple decision-makers. In a MAID, nodes represent variables such as decisions, uncertainties, utilities, and influences, while directed edges indicate causal relationships or dependencies between them. Each agent is associated with a subset of nodes, representing their local decisions, beliefs, and preferences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). MAIDs allow for the explicit representation of interactions between agents, including cooperation, competition, coordination, and negotiation. This enables the analysis of strategic interactions and the prediction of outcomes resulting from the decisions of multiple agents. There has been a lot of related work done by Google Deepmind (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>) on agent incentives for artificial intelligence architectures which forms the underlying motivator to try and bring the same ideas to DeFi. Just as Bayesian networks make explicit the dependencies between probabilistic variables, MAIDs make explicit the dependencies between the probabilistic variables that determine the decision taken by each agent in the game. Note that for every MAID, there is a corresponding extensive form game.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. The next section introduces MAIDs. Section 3 describes a simple governance model. In Section 4, we solve the MAID for Nash equilibria in a single-agent and in a multi-agent setting. Section 5 presents a MAID for MakerDAO governance. Finally, Section 6 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Multi Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs)</head><p>In this section, we recall the necessary notions from Koller and Milch <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to introduce MAIDs and the algorithm to compute Nash equilibria of MAIDs. Definition 2.1 (Chance, Decision, and Utility Variables). We define the variables as follows:</p><p>• A chance variable represents uncertain events or outcomes, similar to nodes in Bayesian networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that affect each agent's decisions. The set of all chance variables is denoted by 𝜒.</p><p>• A decision variable is a variable whose value is chosen by an agent and these are the decisions that each agent 𝑎 ∈ A can make. The set of all chance variables is denoted by D. • A utility variable specifies a utility function for each agent 𝑎 ∈ A. The set of all utility variables is denoted by U. We define V := 𝜒 ∪ D ∪ U the set of all variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.2 (MAID).</head><p>A MAID is tuple M = ⟨A, 𝜒, D, U⟩, where A is the (finite) set of agents, 𝜒 the (finite) set of chance variables, D the (finite) set of decision variables, and U the (finite) set of utility variables. For each agent 𝑎 ∈ A the individual sets of variables are ⟨D 𝑎 , U 𝑎 ⟩ and thus D = 𝑎∈ A D 𝑎 , U = 𝑎∈ A U 𝑎 . Note that M defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> structure where variables are nodes.</p></div>

Let M = ⟨A, 𝜒, D, U⟩ be a MAID. For every variable 𝑋 ∈ V, Pa(𝑋 ) ⊂ V \ U is the set of all parent nodes. By definition (and in keeping with the structure of a DAG) utility variables do not have child nodes. For any agent 𝑎 ∈ A, the parent set Pa(𝐷) for 𝐷 ∈ D 𝑎 , is the set of variables whose values agent 𝑎 knows when he chooses a value for D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.5 (Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD)).</head><p>Let M be a MAID.

A decision rule for a decision variable 𝐷 ∈ D is a function that maps each instantiation pa of parents Pa(𝐷) to a probability distribution over the domain dom(𝐷). An assignment of decision rules to every decision 𝐷 ∈ D 𝑎 for a particular agent in 𝑎 ∈ A is called a strategy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.8 (Joint Distribution</head><p>). If M is a MAID and 𝜎 is a strategy profile for M, then the joint distribution for M induced by 𝜎, denoted 𝑃 M [𝜎 ] , is the joint distribution over V defined by the Bayes network where:</p><p>• the set of variables is V;</p><p>• for 𝑋, 𝑌 ∈ V, there is an edge 𝑋 → 𝑌 iff 𝑋 ∈ Pa(𝑌 );</p><p>• for all 𝑋 ∈ V \ D, the CPD for 𝑋 is P(𝑋 );</p><p>• for all 𝐷 ∈ D, the CPD for 𝐷 is 𝜎 (𝐷).</p><p>We are ready to motivate the definition of agent utility.</p><p>1 there are more things on the utility. maybe we need to add them.</p><p>Definition 2.9 (Expected Utility).

Definition 2.11 (Nash Equilibrium for a MAID). A strategy profile 𝜎 is a Nash equilibrium for a MAID M if for all agents 𝑎 ∈ A, 𝜎 D 𝑎 is optimal for the strategy profile 𝜎. Now that we understand the Nash equilibrium in a MAID, we present an algorithm that helps us compute the Nash Equilibria <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Proposition 2.12 (MAID and Extensive-Form Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). Let M be a MAID. Then, there is a corresponding extensive-form game tree T . For any strategy profile 𝜎, the payoff vector for 𝜎 in M is the same as for 𝜎 in T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Algorithm for Computing the Nash Equilibrium</head><p>In order to compute the Nash equilibrium for a particular MAID M, we will require the use of a few more definitions as follows:</p><p>Definition 2.13 (s-reachable). A node 𝐷 ′ is 𝑠-reachable from a node 𝐷 in a MAID M if there exists some utility node 𝑈 ∈ U 𝐷 such that adding a new parent 𝐷 ′′ to 𝐷 ′ would create an active path in M from 𝐷 ′′ to 𝑈 , given the evidence set Pa(𝐷) ∪ {𝐷 }.</p><p>Here, a path is considered active in a MAID if it is active in the same graph viewed as a Bayesian network (BN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 2.14 (Relevance Graph). The relevance graph for a MAID M is a directed graph whose nodes are the decision nodes of M. There is an edge directed from node 𝐷 to node 𝐷 ′ (denoted 𝐷 → 𝐷 ′ ) if and only if 𝐷 ′ is 𝑠-reachable from 𝐷 in M.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.15 (Strongly Connected Component).</head><p>A set S of nodes in a directed graph is a strongly connected component (SCC) if for every pair of nodes 𝐷 ≠ 𝐷 ′ ∈ S, there exists a directed path from 𝐷 to 𝐷 ′ . A maximal SCC is an SCC that is not a strict subset of any other SCC.</p><p>We can find the maximal SCCs of a relevance graph in linear time, by constructing a component graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> whose nodes are the maximal SCCs of the graph.

This is done based on the previously selected decision rules, with arbitrary decision rules assigned to decisions that are not pertinent to the current SCC. In this derived MAID, the only decision nodes that remain are those within the current SCC, while all other decision nodes are treated as chance nodes. To find the equilibrium in this transformed graph, a subroutine designed to identify equilibria in games is used. The game is then transformed into a game tree, and a standard game-solving algorithm is applied to identify a decision rule that maximizes the expected utility for the individual agent.</p><p>Before stating the result of correctness of the algorithm, we need the following definition. Definition 2.17 (Perfect Recall). An agent 𝑎 ∈ A has perfect recall w.r.t. a total order 𝐷 1 , . . . , 𝐷 𝑛 over D 𝑎 if for all 𝐷 𝑖 , 𝐷 𝑗 ∈ D 𝑎 , 𝑖 &lt; 𝑗 implies that 𝐷 𝑖 ∈ Pa(𝐷 𝑗 ) and Pa(𝐷 𝑖 ) ⊂ Pa(𝐷 𝑗 ).</p><p>Proposition 2.18 (Correctness of Algorithm 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). Suppose every agent has perfect recall. Then, the output 𝜎 𝑚 of Algorithm 1 is a Nash equilibrium for M.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model</head><p>Let us first describe a simple governance game. Assuming that there are 𝑛 homogeneous agents (meaning that all of these agents exhibit same exact behaviour given similar situations) who own stake in the governance of a DeFi protocol. Assume that the DeFi protocol has a governance token $GOV and each of these agents owns some amount of $GOV that would enable them to vote on proposals. Proposals can be brought forward by members of the governance for the rest to make a decision on. It is assumed that the member who brings in the proposal will choose to remain neutral and will abstain from voting. For example, in a DeFi lending borrowing protocol the proposal could be to strengthen the risk parameters of the collateral assets to allow a user to borrow less amount of an asset at the same amount of collateral simply to preserve the sustainability of the protocol. Let us visualise this model through the lens of MAIDs. Here we define the input variables of the MAID M = (A, 𝜒, D, U) in the following way:</p><p>(1) A: set of 𝑛 agents;</p><p>(2) D 𝑎 = {𝑑 𝑎 }: set of decision variables for each agent 𝑎 ∈ A,</p><p>where 𝑑 𝑎 = {yes, no} (decisions about a proposal); (3) U 𝑎 = {𝑢 𝑎 }: set of utility variables for each agent 𝑎 ∈ A (How sustainable this decision would be for the protocol? Will it benefit the protocol?) (4) 𝜒 = {CR, MS}: set of chance variables (collateral risk CR and market sentiment MS that determine the decision, where CR ∈ {risky, not risky} and MS ∈ {good, bad}.</p><p>We define utilities as follows: For agent 𝑎 ∈ A,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑢 𝑎 (𝑑 𝑎 |CR = risky, MS = bad) = +100 if 𝑑 𝑎 = yes, -100 if 𝑑 𝑎 = no.</formula><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑢 𝑎 (𝑑 𝑎 |CR = risky, MS = good) = +50 if 𝑑 𝑎 = yes, -50 if 𝑑 𝑎 = no.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Explanation of the Utilities</head><p>As we have defined two chance variables-collateral risk and market sentiment-we need distinguish between four cases.</p><p>(1) For any agent 𝑎 ∈ A, given a collateral asset classified as risky and a prevailing negative market sentiment, voting in favor of the proposal (decision variable 𝑑 𝑎 = yes) yields a positive of +100. Conversely, voting against the proposal (𝑑 𝑎 = no) results in a utility of -100. (2) For any agent 𝑎 ∈ A, given a risky collateral asset and a positive market sentiment, voting in favor of the proposal (decision variable 𝑑 𝑎 = yes) results in a positive utility of +50. Conversely, voting against the proposal (𝑑 𝑎 = no) leads to a utility of -50. (3) For any agent 𝑎 ∈ A, given a non-risky collateral asset and a negative market sentiment, voting in favor of the proposal (decision variable 𝑑 𝑎 = yes) yields a positive utility of +25, primarily driven by anticipated future risk mitigation benefits. Analogously for 𝑑 𝑎 = no. (4) For any agent 𝑎 ∈ A, given a non-risky collateral asset and a positive market sentiment, voting in favor of the proposal (decision variable 𝑑 𝑎 = yes) is deemed unsustainable and results in a utility decrement of 100. Analogously for 𝑑 𝑎 = no.</p><p>Remark 2. We consider equal voting power regardless of the amount of $GOV tokens that each agent has. Under stake-based voting, each agent's expected utility would be scaled by the proportion of $GOV tokens. In our model, we assume independence between the chance variables-market sentiment and collateral risk. We do not assume a direct causal link between market sentiment and collateral risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. We assume homogeneous agents to make the model tractable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis</head><p>As devised in Section 2, we present some experimental results using the "pycid" library developed by Google Deepmind <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We start by initialising and devising dummy variables as follows:</p><p>• Recall collateral risk as CR. For CR ∈ {risky, not risky}, we create dummy binary variables where risky is denoted by 1 and not risky is denoted by 0. When we say that collateral is "risky", we mean that the collateral is portraying high levels of price volatility at that instant of time and vice versa when we use the term "not risky". • Recall market sentiment as MS. For MS ∈ {good, bad}, we similarly create dummy binary variables where good is denoted by 0 and bad is denoted by 1. Again, when we say that market sentiment is "good", we mean that the market conditions for the collateral asset and future sentiment for its price volatility is favourable for long term investment and vice versa when we use the term "bad". • Vote as V. Notice that V = 𝑑 𝑎 and the notation was chosen for the slight difference to represent the action of voting and for ease of keeping track. Recall that V = 𝑑 𝑎 = {yes, no} = {1, 0} for 𝑎 ∈ A. Simply, yes implies voting for the proposal and no is voting against the proposal. Every agent in the protocol has the same exact choices for the proposal. • Utility as U as defined above as a utility function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Single Agent Optimal Strategy</head><p>We have all the tools that we need to analyse the model. Let us consider the case of a single agent in this model of governance. Given inputs(A, 𝜒, D, U) as we have defined above in Section 3 equations (1), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and (4), we have all the ingredients required to develop the MAID for the single agent in question and the dynamics of the governance protocol as defined above can be summarized in the causal influence diagram (CID) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>CR, MS influence the V and U. We defined the conditional probability distribution (CPD) on the chance variables, in the form of a uniform distribution, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑃 (CR = risky(1)) = 𝑃 (CR = not risky(0)) = 0.5 𝑃 (MS = good(0)) = 𝑃 (MS = bad(1)) = 0.5</formula><p>Under the utility functions defined in the previous section and using the preliminaries, the optimal policy for 𝑉 = 0 (Vote against) and 𝑉 = 1 (Vote For) can be summarised in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. when CR = 0 and MS = 0 That is, for any arbitrary agent in the MAID, the optimal strategy 𝜎 for every agent would be to vote for strengthening the risk parameters (V = 1) in case the collateral dynamics are risky (CR = 1) or if the market sentiment is bad (MS = 1)and vote against the proposal (V = 0) only if both the collateral dynamics are less volatile (CR = 0) and the market sentiment is good (MS = 0) too. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Multi Agent Equilibrium</head><p>To put things back into perspective, we know the optimal strategy for an agent in our governance model and so we have an understanding of their independent decisions when faced with the same conditions. But what does it mean for their collective equilibrium? Let us formally address this.</p><p>Remark 3. If we assume that all agents in the governance protocol are making the decisions simultaneously, then it is safe to also assume that their independent decisions would converge to the same decision. So we make another assumption of non simultaneous decisions and every agent can see each other's vote to add in some complexity.</p><p>Remark 4. In a DeFi governance model where agents are homogeneous and share the same optimal strategy but make decisions at different times, voting on a proposal takes the form of a Stackelberg Game, where the leader acts according to their optimal policy first.</p><p>To see this in action let us consider the case of two agents in the system and their interactions. Since the population of governance voters is assumed to be homogeneous and similar, taking case of two agents is sufficient. Like before let us define and initialise variables as follows:</p><p>• Agent 1 as A1 • Agent 2 as A2</p><p>• Utility of Agent 1 as U1 We change the perspective of the game. As we have assumed before, every agent 𝑎 ∈ A has the same CID (V 𝑎 , 𝐸 𝑎 ) which implies the same chance 𝜒, decision variables D 𝑎 and utility variables U 𝑎 for all agents.</p><p>Given some value of chance variables CR and MS, agent A1 has made a decision to vote V on the proposal to derive utility U1 which will be seen by the other agent in the governance protocol. The influence diagram (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>) implies that each agent's decision has an effect on the other's utility. Recall the non simultaneous criterion that implies that one agent's vote influences the other agent's vote and hence also the decision. Consider time steps t = {1, 2} (i.e the game will run for 2 time steps for each agent to make their decision). Both agents have the same chance variables and decision variables. For t = 1, A1 makes a decision that gives him utility according to the scheme mentioned in Section 3. At t = 2, A2 observes the decision made by A1 and makes their own decision. If agent A2 follows the decision of agent A1, it also follows their optimal strategy. Hence, the utilities are equal, U1 = U2.</p><p>In all other cases we claim that the utilities would be ≤ 0. Indeed, since agents A1 and A2 are following their optimal strategies and are homogeneous (similar), a positive utility U2 for A2 by choosing a different decision than A1 breaks the homogeneous assumption since that would imply that one of the two agents derive more utility from a decision than the other which is not possible.</p><p>Remark 5. Given a system with agents A1 and A2, where A1 is designated as the leader, if agent A2 experiences a net positive utility (𝑈 2 &gt; 0) by adopting a strategy divergent from A1's, the following conditions must hold:</p><p>(1) Agent Heterogeneity: The utility functions of A1 and A2 are not identical, implying diverse preferences or objectives. (2) Strategic Rationality: Agent A2's decision to deviate is a strategic choice, prioritizing its individual utility maximization over collective welfare or protocol adherence. Under these conditions, A2's behavior can be characterized as strategic or potentially adversarial, posing a risk to the system's equilibrium.</p><p>Using Algorithm 1, we obtain the results for the pure Nash equilibrium of the system displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. The analysis indicates that in a two-agent system where agent A1 acts as a leader, the optimal strategy for agent A2 is to mimic A1's decision. This outcome aligns with the equilibrium of a Stackelberg game <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, wherein the leader's choice precedes and influences the follower's action. Consequently, within a homogeneous agent population, where all What does it mean for DeFi governance protocols? One could claim that if the optimal strategy for any arbitrary agent in a DeFi governance is to promote protocol sustainability then the protocol should have no instances of manipulation (such as Governance Extractable Value <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) assuming homogeneity of agents. In case there is a deviation from the optimal strategy (or if there exists an incentive to deviate) then there will exist an instance of "attack" behavior which may be harmful to the protocol. In the next section, we look at a very simple attack model using MAIDs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Application to MakerDAO Governance Protocol</head><p>The Maker Protocol operates as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating the creation of Dai, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Users engage with the protocol by depositing cryptocurrency assets, such as Ethereum or other tokens, into smart contracts as collateral. Based on the value of this collateral, users can then generate Dai, typically up to a predetermined percentage of the collateral's worth. To maintain the stability and security of the system, the protocol enforces various risk parameters, including collateralization ratios and debt ceilings, which dictate the relationship between collateral and the amount of Dai that can be generated. Users pay stability fees on the Dai they generate, serving as interest rates that contribute to the protocol's stability. Governance of the Maker Protocol is decentralized, with MKR token holders participating in decision-making through a voting mechanism. These holders vote on proposals to adjust risk parameters and other protocol settings, ensuring the protocol remains responsive to market conditions and emerging risks. Additionally, the protocol includes mechanisms for liquidating collateral if its value falls below a certain threshold, helping to mitigate systemic risk and maintain the stability of the Dai ecosystem. More information about the governance dynamics of the Maker protocol can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The binary voting mechanism employed by MakerDAO, where MKR holders cast yes/no votes on proposals, is analogous to the governance games analyzed in preceding sections. By applying MAIDs to a simplified binary voting model, we can examine agent interactions under two scenarios: homogeneous agents sharing identical MAIDs and heterogeneous agents with opposing objectives (e.g., protocol sustainability vs. disruption). This analysis provides insights into the game-theoretic dynamics within the protocol and MAIDs can be used in similar ways to model more complex interactions and in turn be used to create a formal verification system for coordination games in DeFi governance protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">MAID for MakerDAO</head><p>In this section, we outline the structure of a game between the users of the Maker protocol and the MakerDAO governance member on the smart contract level. For the MAID, the variables are as follows:</p><p>• The chance variables 𝜒 include smart contract modules, market conditions, collateral dynamics, demand for DAI stablecoin and security risks. • The decision variables D include debt (that the user wants to undertake) and the risk parameters (that the governance DAO members want to set for a particular asset). • The utility variables U include profitability for the users of the protocol and protocol sustainability for the governance members of the DAO.</p><p>The MAID is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Chance</head><p>Variables. First, we outline the various smart contracts modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that interact with each other and with external actors to maintain system stability and facilitate user interactions. Then, we describe the remaining chance variables.</p><p>(1) Smart Contract Modules:</p><p>• Core Module: The Core Module is crucial to the system as it contains the entire state of the Maker Protocol and controls the central mechanisms of the system while it is in the expected normal state of operation. • Collateral Module: The collateral module is deployed for every new ilk (collateral type) added to Vat. It contains all the adapters and auction contracts for one specific collateral type. • The System Stabilizer Module: It's purpose is to correct the system when the value of the collateral backing Dai drops below the liquidation level (determined by governance) when the stability of the system is at risk. The system stabilizer module creates incentives for Auction Keepers (external actors) to step in and drive the system back to a safe state (system balance) by participating in both debt and surplus auctions and, in turn, earn profits by doing so. • Oracle Module: An oracle module is deployed for each collateral type, feeding it the price data for a corresponding collateral type to the Vat. The Oracle Module introduces the whitelisting of addresses, which allows them to broadcast price updates off-chain, which are then fed into a median before being pulled into the OSM. The Spot'ter will then proceed to read from the OSM and will act as the liaison between the oracles and dss. • MKR Module: The MKR Module contains the MKR token, which is a deployed DS Token contract. It is an ERC20 Adjusting parameters like the liquidation ratio and debt ceiling is essential for managing security risks associated with insolvency or exposure to volatile assets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Decision Variables.</head><p>( For instance, the debt ceiling sets limits on debt generation against specific collateral types to prevent over-leveraging and maintain system stability. Similarly, the liquidation ratio and penalty incentivize users to uphold sufficient collateralization levels, mitigating the risk of liquidation events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Utility Variables.</head><p>(1) Profitability: Profitability within the Maker Protocol ecosystem is intricately linked to the effectiveness of risk parameters and smart contract modules. The stability fee, determined by governance, directly impacts the profitability of Vault owners by influencing the cost of borrowing Dai against collateral. Additionally, the efficacy of the System Stabilizer Module in managing liquidations and surplus auctions affects the profitability of participants, including Keepers engaging in these auctions to earn profits. Higher liquidation penalties incentivize users to maintain adequate collateralization, thereby reducing the need for liquidations and potential losses for the protocol. (2) Sustainability: The sustainability of the Maker Protocol hinges on prudent management of risk parameters such as the debt ceiling, liquidation ratio, and stability fee. While higher debt ceilings can potentially increase revenue through stability fees, they also expose the protocol to greater risk if not managed carefully. Similarly, a lower liquidation ratio allows for more borrowing and higher fee generation but escalates the risk of undercollateralization and losses during market downturns. The stability fee, crucial for revenue generation, must strike a delicate balance to avoid discouraging borrowing and reducing demand for DAI. The Governance Module assumes a pivotal role in aligning decisions regarding risk parameters and protocol upgrades with sustainability goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this study, we explored a simple DeFi governance game and analyzed its equilibria in both single and multi-agent settings using Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs). Our analysis included a practical example involving an attacker and provided the framework for constructing a MAID specifically tailored to MakerDAO, which can serve as a foundation for further exploration of decentralized governance dynamics. Our work demonstrates the potential of MAIDs as a powerful tool for understanding the complex interactions within DeFi governance models. However, there are several promising directions for future research. Firstly, our current model employs discrete uniform conditional probability distributions; extending this to continuous distributions could yield more insights. Additionally, the analysis was limited to two agents, and there is significant potential to expand this framework to accommodate a larger number of agents, each with possibly different utility functions, to better mirror the diverse landscape of DeFi ecosystems. Moreover, while our study does not assume a direct causal link between market sentiment and collateral risk, incorporating such causation could provide a deeper understanding of the effects on governance outcomes. Solving the MAID for MakerDAO using realworld parameters remains an open challenge and will be crucial for validating the applicability of our model. . As DeFi continues to grow, such tools will be instrumental in guiding the development of secure and resilient governance structures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 2 . 7 (</head><label>27</label><figDesc>(Partial) Strategy Profile).
