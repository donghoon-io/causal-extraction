<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Long term decisions, such as the design of infrastructure systems and buildings or the planning of risk mitigation measures, should be made in consideration of the uncertain future. The initial design of a system determines its flexibility, i.e. its ability to cope with potential future changes. Increasing flexibility is generally considered to be a good approach to dealing with future uncertainty, such as climate change uncertainty, but its effects have not been systematically investigated. We propose the use of Markov Decision Processes combined with Influence Diagrams to solve adaptation planning problems. This framework can identify the optimal system type and capacity and determine the value of flexibility. It is here applied to two numerical examples: Planning of a waste water treatment plant under uncertainty in future population growth and planning of a flood protection system under uncertain climate change scenarios. Based on these idealized examples, it is shown that for flexible systems a lower initial capacity of the system is recommendable, while for inflexible systems a conservative design (with high safety factors) should be applied. The value of flexibility is shown to be high when significant learning is expected in the future, i.e. if information gathered in the future significantly reduces uncertainty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Infrastructure systems typically have a lifetime of many decades and the future demand on their capacity is highly uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hall et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Yzer et al., 2014)</ref>. This is the case for water distribution and wastewater treatment, energy production and distribution, transportation and flood protection systems. Similarly, land use planning has long term implications, and buildings have user requirements that can change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. The design and planning of such systems should therefore address uncertainty on future climate, socioeconomic development, changing societal preferences and changing needs arising from new knowledge and information. An overview of example planning problems and related future uncertainties is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Systematic approaches to deal with the uncertain future are often referred to as adaptation strategies, especially in the context of climate change uncertainty. <ref type="bibr">Frankhauser et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hallegatte (2009)</ref> summarize and qualitatively assess adaptation strategies from multiple sectors.</p><p>In some problem settings, the best adaptation strategy is obvious, especially if the number of alternatives is limited. However, in most cases there exist a potentially large number of alternative solutions: the decision maker is not only choosing from different types of adaptation strategies (e.g. building a new water reservoir or reducing water losses), but can also decide about the dimensions/capacity of the proposed infrastructures (e.g. capacity of the water reservoir) and often about the flexibility of the system as well, i.e. its ability to be changed in the future without excessive costs, as defined later in Sec. 2. Decisions analysis can help identifying the best solution in these cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hallegatte et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cox (2012)</ref> provide an overview of decisions support methodologies that have been used in research and practice for dealing with the uncertain future. The commonly used approach to account for future uncertainties and for evaluating the flexibility of engineering systems is the so-called Real Option (RO) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Martins et al., 2015)</ref>. The term was adopted from the field of finance. The original formulation, with quantities such as volatility, current and exercise price or expiration date, and the related models and evaluation methods, are not directly applicable to engineering questions. Nevertheless, the term RO analysis is today used for a broad spectrum of methods, which typically involve decision trees for representing the problem and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and different optimization algorithms to evaluate them. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Neufville et al. (2006)</ref> propose to use RO for evaluating different designs of infrastructure and buildings with uncertain future number of users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Buurman et al. (2009)</ref> present the application of RO to design of maritime safety systems under uncertain future terrorism threats. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gersonius et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Woodward et al. (2014)</ref> use RO analysis for optimizing the water systems for urban drainage and flood defense, respectively, under climate change uncertainty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marques et al. (2014)</ref> utilize RO analysis to find optimal design of water supply system under uncertain future demand. Martínez <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ceseña et al. (2013)</ref> provide an overview of RO applications in the planning of energy generation projects under different types of uncertainty, including the uncertainty on future energy prices or uncertainty on the probabilistic model describing the resource characteristics (wind, water). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fawcett et al. (2014)</ref> use RO for highway design under traffic growth uncertainty. Further studies use the same methods without explicitly calling them RO analysis, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Basupi and Kapelan, 2014)</ref>. For complex problems with many decision alternatives, the RO analysis using decision trees becomes intractable, the examples presented in the literature thus focus on rather simpler problems. Additionally, they mostly do not consider the fact that also the future decisions will be made under uncertainty, even if reduced.</p><p>This paper proposes the use of (fully observable) Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for optimizing long-term adaptation strategies under uncertainty. The proposed approach is general enough to replace RO analysis with decision trees for most applications, and it offers additional possibilities and advantages: (1) Modeling of the uncertain demand as a Markov process increases the computational efficiency of the model and thus the ability to tackle complex problems. (2) The introduction of partial observability (i.e. use of POMDPs) allows explicit modeling of the fact that the demand on the system will also be uncertain at the time of the future decisions. This is particularly relevant for problems where the system is designed for an extreme event, i.e. where the demand on the systems corresponds e.g. to a flood discharge, extreme precipitation or extreme wind speed. The estimates of frequency/magnitude of such extreme events are highly uncertain because they rely on limited historic data and imperfect models and the uncertainty thus remains also at the time of future decisions. (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for an indication of partial/full observability and Section 3.3 for a more detailed discussion.) (3) Using influence diagrams for graphically representing the problem facilitates communication of the model and its assumptions. Influence diagrams are significantly more concise than classical decision trees, which is a major advantage when representing complex problems with many decision options and many decision points in time. A comparable approach has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Nishijima, 2015)</ref> for the case of climate adaptation, but without considering partial observability of the processes. More recently, <ref type="bibr">(Pozzi et al., under review)</ref> use hidden-model MDP for optimizing climate adaptation decisions and they investigate the effect of future observations and learning on the decisions. The flexibility of the systems is not included in any of these studies.</p><p>The decision criterion is formulated in analogy to classical static Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), which defines the optimum as the solution that maximizes the difference between expected benefits and expected costs. Risk, which is defined as expected damage, can be considered as an additional expected cost. The objective function in static CBA is formulated as <ref type="bibr">(Špačková and Straub, 2015)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝒗 𝑜𝑝𝑡 = argmax 𝒗 [𝑏(𝒗) -𝑐(𝒗) -𝑟(𝒗)]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where v are parameters characterizing the system such as height of flood protection dikes, capacity of a waste water treatment plant or the size of a restricted area in a land use plan. b(v) and c(v) are the expected net present values of benefits and costs, and r(v) is the net present value of risk.</p><p>Unlike classical static CBA, the proposed framework uses a dynamic formulation, which explicitly models the future uncertainties in these quantities and the decisions that will be made in the future, conditionally on future observations (the preposterior principle). In the dynamic formulation, the objective function of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is modified as described in Sec. 3.1 (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">4</ref>). The future decisions are thus optimized jointly with the initial capacity. Also the optimal timing of future system adjustments is automatically identified.</p><p>In the proposed dynamic formulation, the ability of the systems to be changed in the future is explicitly modeled. A quantitative measure of flexibility adapted from <ref type="bibr">(Špačková et al., 2015)</ref> is proposed, which is a function of the costs for adjusting the system in the future when new needs arise. The decision model can be applied in two ways: (1) When the flexibility of the system is fixed, the optimal initial capacity of the system is selected taking into account its flexibility. (2) When the flexibility is an optimization parameter, the model can be used to answer the question, how much should one pay initially to make the system flexible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Flexibility</head><p>Flexibility describes the potential of a system to be changed in the future without excessive costs. Flexibility has been recognized as an important quality in engineering design <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fricke and Schulz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ross et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Saleh et al., 2009)</ref>. Alternatively, the terms adaptability, reversibility or changeability are used in the same context, with slightly different meanings. Examples of flexible systems in infrastructure planning include:</p><p> flood protection systems whose possible future upgrades are facilitated by reserving land for future construction of additional dikes or extension of existing ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Vrijling et al., 2009)</ref>;  an urban drainage system where the backbone parts are overdesigned to allow extension of the system in the future or which enables cheap adjustment of the retention capacity in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Radhakrishnan et al., 2014)</ref>;  a motorway that is built broader so that additional lanes can be established in the future without the need for extensive changes to the road structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lamb et al., 2011)</ref>;  a building design enabling cheap future conversion, e.g. dividing large apartments into smaller ones, turning an office building into a block of flats or expanding a building <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allahaim and Alfaris, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boehland, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>We propose a measure of flexibility following <ref type="bibr">(Špačková et al., 2015)</ref>, which expresses how costly it is to adjust the capacity 𝑣 of a system in the future, relative to the initial investment at time 𝑡 0 . The flexibility 𝜑 is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝜑 = 𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ) -𝑐 A (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 , 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ) 𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝑐 0 (𝑣) is the cost of implementing a system with capacity 𝑣 initially; 𝑐 𝐴 (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 , 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ) is the undiscounted cost of a future adjustment of the system capacity from 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 to 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 .</p><p>Flexibility 𝜑 = 0 corresponds to an inflexible system and 𝜑 = 1 to a fully flexible system. For fully flexible systems with 𝜑 = 1, the cost of increasing the capacity from 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 to 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 equals the difference between building to these capacities initially, 𝑐 𝐴 (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 , 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ) = 𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ) -𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 ). For such systems, the number of steps to reach the final capacity is irrelevant; the total costs are the same if one builds to the final capacity at once or if one adjusts the capacity at every time step.</p><p>For inflexible systems with 𝜑 = 0, the cost of increasing the capacity to 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 is equal to cost of building to this capacity initially, irrespective of the existing capacity 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 , therefore 𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ) = 𝑐 A (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 , 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 ). When the capacity of an inflexible system is changed, the existing system cannot be used, the system has to be built completely anew. Flexibility can also take negative values, which occur if the original system must be fully replaced and removal costs are invoked in addition to the cost of the new system. The flexibility of an irreversible system is -∞ , because its adjustment costs are infinite.</p><p>Because this measure of flexibility is defined in function of costs, it is suitable to be utilized in a quantitative optimization. This is in contrast to previously proposed measures of flexibility (e g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kumar, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ross et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sönmez and Koç, 2015)</ref>, which primarily focus on quantifying the number of ways the system can be changed. In these measures, costs are included only as a constraint for accepting/rejecting the options, if at all.</p><p>For optimizing infrastructure planning, one requires the adjustment cost relative to the initial cost. It follows from Eq. 1 that the cost of changing the capacity from 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 to 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 is 𝑐 𝐴 (𝜑, 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 , 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 ) = 𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑎𝑑 , 𝜑) -𝜑 • 𝑐 0 (𝑣 𝑜𝑟 , 𝜑).</p><p>(3)</p><p>The difference in costs for systems with different flexibility is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Note that in this figure we assume that the initial costs independent of flexibility 𝜑 (unlike in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Illustration of the costs for a fully flexible vs. an inflexible system. (a) Initial costs when the system is first implemented; (b) adjustment costs for adapting the system to new needs in the future, when the original capacity is 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 . Adapted from <ref type="bibr">(Špačková et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The proposed definition of flexibility is kept simple on purpose. In most infrastructure planning problems, the flexibility cannot be computed exactly, nor is it a constant value. It varies in function of the initial capacity 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 . Furthermore, typically only a discrete set of the planning alternatives are evaluated, and the flexibility can thus be quantified only for those. Nevertheless, the value of flexibility can be determined approximately based on simple considerations, and the concept then enables general statements and conclusion. If a more detailed model is desired, the flexibility can be expressed in function of 𝑣 𝑜𝑟 and 𝑣 𝑎𝑑 .</p><p>In this paper, the capacity 𝛾 is expressed as a single scalar value defined on a continuous scale. It can be extended to the multidimensional case, i.e. a vector of capacity values, if a single value is not sufficient to express the system performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The planning problem</head><p>The aim is to optimize the capacity 𝑣 of an infrastructure system with given flexibility over the system lifetime. In this section, different formulations of this decision problem are proposed, which should be selected depending on the characteristics of the problem. We first introduce the variables that are used in the model and formulate the objective of the optimization (Sec 3.1). In section 3.2, the value of flexibility is defined, which allows to quantify the gain from establishing a flexible system as compared to an inflexible one. Section 3.3 discusses the difference between fully and partially observable random processes. Finally, solution strategies and algorithms for the proposed models are presented in Sec. 3.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Modelling framework</head><p>The system demand is determining the design of the infrastructure system. Examples of demand variables are given in the 3 rd column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The uncertain evolution of the demand in the future is modeled through a discrete-time Markov process {𝛩 𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ 𝐓}, where 𝐓 = {1,2, … , 𝑁} are the discrete time steps (e.g. years), as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. This process is commonly called the "core process". It is described by the transition probability 𝑝(𝜃 𝑖+1 |𝜃 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑖 ), i.e. the probability of the demand being in state 𝜃 𝑖+1 at time 𝑖 + 1 given that it was in state 𝜃 𝑖 at time 𝑖 and capacity 𝑣 𝑖 was selected.</p><p>In many real applications, a direct modeling of the demand as a Markov process is not possible, because the Markov independence property, i.e. the assumption that the future of the system is independent on the past given the present, is not fulfilled. However, even non-Markovian processes can be transformed to Markovian processes through augmentation of the state space with additional variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rachelson et al., 2008)</ref>. In such cases, the variable 𝛩 𝑖 in each step is replaced with a set of variables 𝚯 𝑖 . This approach is demonstrated in the numerical example in Sec. 5 on optimizing flood protection, where uncertainty on future extreme rainfall events is modeled using 2 variables: one variable representing the climate scenario and the related trend (i.e. a "memory" in the stochastic process) and a second variable representing the annual maximum rainfall in each year. Circles denote the random variables, squares the decision nodes and diamonds the utility (benefit/costs) nodes. The arrows represent the dependence structure and the availability of information for making decisions. An arrow pointing towards a decision indicates that the corresponding parent node is known at the time of making the decision. The semantics of these influence diagrams follow those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jensen and Nielsen, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>If the core process is not directly observable, i.e. if the demand 𝛩 𝑖 cannot be determined with certainty even at time 𝑖 , a random variable 𝑍 𝑖 representing the observation at time step 𝑖 is included in the model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>). Observation 𝑍 𝑖 provides indirect information about the demand 𝛩 𝑖 . The relationship between 𝛩 𝑖 and 𝑍 𝑖 is described by the conditional probability 𝑝(𝑧 𝑖 |𝜃 𝑖 ), which corresponds to the likelihood function. The stochastic process {𝑍 𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ 𝐓} is called the "observation process".</p><p>Decisions on the capacity 𝑣 are (potentially) made at times 𝑡 0 , 𝑡 1 , … , 𝑡 𝑁 . At 𝑡 0 , the initial capacity 𝑣 0 is selected, at future time steps 𝑡 1 , … . 𝑡 𝑁 the capacity can be adjusted based on the current state of knowledge. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, decisions are made at each time step (e.g. every year). In many applications, such frequent adjustment decisions are not possible or reasonable. Decisions are then considered only every 𝛥𝑡-th time step, as discussed in Sec. 3.4.</p><p>The system demand and capacity determine the benefits (expected gains) and risks (expected losses) throughout the lifetime of the system. Let 𝑏(𝛩 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑖-1 ) denote the benefits and 𝑟(𝛩 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑖-1 ) the risk in the 𝑖th time step. They are functions of the demand 𝛩 𝑖 and the capacity 𝑣 𝑖-1 , which is selected at time 𝑡 𝑖-1 . 𝑐 𝑖 (𝜑, 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑖-1 ) is the cost of adjusting the system capacity from 𝑣 𝑖-1 to 𝑣 𝑖 according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>).</p><p>Benefits minus costs and risk is the reward 𝑊. The goal of the optimization is finding the optimal initial capacity that maximizes the expected value of the discounted life-time reward for given flexibility:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 (𝜑) = argmax 𝑣 0 𝑊 0 (𝜑, 𝑣 𝑜 ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑊 0 (𝜑, 𝑣 𝑜 ) is the expected reward for given flexibility and initial capacity:</p><p>𝑐 0 (𝜑, 𝑣 0 ) are the initial investment costs, and E[. ] is the expected value over all future demands, obtained with the future optimal decisions 𝑣 1 , … , 𝜈 𝑁 . This is a sequential decision problem, in which the optimal initial capacity 𝜈 0 can only be determined by simultaneously optimizing all future capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kochenderfer et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In some cases, the aim can additionally be to select the optimal flexibility of the system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝜑 𝑜𝑝𝑡 = argmax 𝜑 𝑊 0 (𝜑, 𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 (𝜑)).<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Value of flexibility</head><p>The value of flexibility is the additional cost that a decision maker should be willing to spend for a flexible system relative to an inflexible one. It can be determined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑉(𝜑) = 𝑊 0 * (𝜑, 𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 (𝜑)) -𝑊 0 (𝜑 = 0, 𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 (𝜑 = 0)),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where 𝑊 0 * (𝜑, 𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 (𝜑)) is computed according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) under the premise that flexibility is for free, i.e. that the initial cost 𝑐 0 (𝜑, 𝑣 0 ) is the same for all flexibilities 𝜑 (as in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). ].</p><p>(5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Fully or partially observable demands</head><p>If the system demand is fully observable, its current value is known at the time of making the decision; it is only the uncertainty about its future development that remains. In practice, there is always some uncertainty in observations of the demand, but in many applications this uncertainty is negligible compared to other uncertainties in the model. The problem then can be modeled as a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP), shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>. If significant uncertainty about the state of demand at the times of the decisions exists, the problem must be modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>.</p><p>To give examples, the number of inhabitants and the built area of a city, which determine the demand on the sewerage system, can typically be observed with high accuracy. If these are the only variables representing the future demand, the process can be considered as fully observable and modeled as MDP. In contrast, values of assets at risk (buildings, infrastructure) and their vulnerability to a natural hazard are only indirectly deducible from socioeconomic data and available damage models. Significant uncertainty therefore remains in estimating the consequences of a hazard event. Similarly, discharge measurements provide limited information about the full probabilistic distribution of the discharge maxima needed for the design of flood protection. The parameters of the probabilistic distribution of the annual maximum discharge process are thus only partially observable. In these cases, POMDP should be used to model the decision problem.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the observability of demand parameters in selected systems. This list is only indicative and should not be understood as fixed rules on the modeling approach. The ultimate selection of the model type is application-specific and depends on the data availability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Evaluation of the decision processes</head><p>A number of algorithms for solving MDPs and POMDPs has been developed in the last decades, and this continues to be an active field of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Monahan, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kaelbling et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Braziunas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Poupart, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Kochenderfer et al., 2015)</ref>.

The notation utilized here differs partly from conventions found in the classical literature on Markovian decision processes, which is mainly rooted in artificial intelligence applications. The notation utilized in this paper is based on the conventions used in the field of Bayesian networks and decision models; graphical models are used as part of the explanation. We focus on the solution of finite horizon models, where a bounded time interval (e.g. 100 years) is considered. For this purpose, the principle of backward induction can be applied, in which the model is evaluated backwards from the last decision to the initial one. We furthermore restrict the presentation to discrete-state processes; continuous demand parameters are discretized. The computational time needed for solving the decision models depends on the definition of the action and state spaces. It increases with the space of the variables in the core process, with the number of possible actions (possible capacity values), and with the number of decision time instances. Unfortunately, utilization of existing MDP/POMDP softwares for solution of the proposed models is not straightforward because of time-dependent risk and cost in the proposed model. The algorithms utilized for the proposed model are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, they were implemented in Matlab.</p></div>

The uncertain demand in [PE] is modeled as a homogeneous Markov process, where the conditional probability distribution of the demand 𝛩 𝑖 in year 𝑖, 𝑓(𝜃 𝑖 |𝜃 𝑖-1 ), is normal distributed with time dependent mean 𝜇 𝑖 = 𝜃 𝑖-1 + 𝑘 and standard deviation 𝜎, which is assumed to be constant over time.

This model of population growth is hypothetical, but it is straightforward to replace it with another model for a specific area if such is available. Principles of forecasting the demographic changes can be found for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keyfitz and Caswell (2005)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Results and discussion</head><p>The model in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> is evaluated following the procedure described in Sec. 3.4.1. In this example, the benefits are constant with respect to 𝑣 and 𝜑, hence only cost and risk are taken into account.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the main result of the decision model, i.e. the optimal initial capacity of the WWTP, which minimizes the total expected life-time reward (objective function) that is plotted with the solid line, for systems with different flexibilities. For the inflexible system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>), the optimal initial capacity equals 69 × 10 3 PE, for the fully flexible system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>) the optimal initial capacity is significantly lower at 56 × 10 3 PE. As expected, a more conservative design with larger reserve is recommendable for an inflexible system, because future adjustments of the system are more expansive. However, even for the inflexible system, the optimal initial capacity is lower than the mean demand of 85 × 10 3 PE expected at the end of the life-time. The reason for such an under-design being optimal is the effect of discounting that favors delaying investments, in combination with the uncertainty that allows for the possibility that the mean demand at the end of service life will be lower. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> also shows the contribution of the immediate risk and costs computed with Eq. ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>), which are associated with the first decision period of 15 years, and of the sum of future expected rewards computed with Eq. ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>). It can be seen that due to the discounting, the effect of the future reward is relatively small compared to the immediate reward. For illustration purposes, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows three randomly selected scenarios of the demand over the lifetime of the WWTP and the corresponding optimal decisions on capacity for WWTPs with different flexibilities. The optimal initial capacity at time 𝑡 = 0 corresponds to the one found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Every 15 years it is decided whether the capacity is kept or increased, depending on actual demand. To further illustrate the decision process, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the conditional optimization of capacities at time 𝑡 = 75yr for the demand scenario from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>. Because this is the last decision before the end of service life, it is based entirely only the immediate reward, which represents the risk and costs for years 75 to 90.</p><p>The scenario in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref> represents a future where the demand growth approximately follows the predicted mean growth (shown by the dotted line line). For this scenario, the inflexible system with 𝜑 = 0 (dashed line with circles) is never adjusted, even if the actual demand in the second half of the planning period reaches or even exceeds the capacity of the WWTP. The exceedance of the capacity is not sufficiently large to justify the high cost associated with the adjustment of the system capacity, as can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref>: the risk is not large enough to outweigh the immediate costs for increasing the capacity from 69 × 10 3 PE to any higher value. It can, however, also be observed that the objective function (i.e. solid line in the figure) has two local minima and the second local minimum at capacity 82 × 10 3 PE is not significantly higher than the global minimum at capacity 69 × 10 3 PE. This indicates that the optimal decision is sensitive to the model assumptions. In contrast, the flexible system with 𝜑 = 1 is adjusted at almost every decision point under the scenario of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>. The optimization of the last decision is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8c</ref>. It can be observed that the objective function for the flexible system has only one global minimum. The reason is the fact that there is no jump in the adjustment cost function, as can also be observed from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>. Therefore if the observed demand is larger than the one predicted at the last decision time, it is always better to adjust the system, because the adjustment costs are significantly lower than in the case of non-or partly flexible systems.</p><p>In the scenario of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>, the demand first decreases and then slightly grows in the second half of the planning time. In such a scenario, the partly and inflexible systems (dashed line with circles and dashed line with crosses) should never be adjusted as the initially selected capacity is sufficient over the whole life time. The fully flexible system (dashed line with stars) should only be adjusted once at time 𝑡 = 60yr, when the demand exceeds the initial demand at time 𝑡 = 0.</p><p>In the scenario of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>, the demand increases faster than the mean prediction, especially in the second half of the lifetime. In such a scenario, the partly and non-flexible systems (dashed line with circles and dashed line with crosses) are adjusted at time 𝑡 = 60yr after the observed demand exceeds the WWTP capacity. The fully flexible system (dashed line with stars) is adjusted every 15 years and it thus keeps an unused capacity (reserve) during the whole lifetime.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Value of flexibility for WWTP</head><p>The value of flexibility is determined following Section 3.2.

The corresponding optimal initial capacity for varying flexibilities is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>.

The relative value of flexibility with respect to the initial investment costs is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The value of the fully flexible system is approximately 6% of the initial costs of building to the optimal protection level. Overall, the value of flexibility increases non-linearly with flexibility, and a large degree of flexibility is necessary to lead to noticeable benefits. </p></div>

Considering the significant associated uncertainties, such decisions should ideally take into account the flexibility of the protection strategies.</p><p>Here, we consider the implementation of a new river flood defense at time 𝑡 0 = 0 , whose capacity may be adjusted in the future at times 𝑡 = 30 and 𝑡 = 60 years, the total planning horizon is 90 years. The annual discount rate is 0.02. The assumptions made in the example are based on realistic case studies previously analyzed at our institute <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ellinger, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Perosa, 2016)</ref>. However, direct transfer of the results to other catchments is not straightforward because the risk, cost as well as the impact of climate are site specific.</p><p>An influence diagram for the decision problem is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The decision problem is modeled by a POMDP. The uncertainty in the future demand is modeled using two random variables: climate scenario 𝑆 𝑖 representing the uncertainty in future climate and annual maximum discharge 𝐷 𝑖 . The probability distribution of the annual maximum discharge is defined conditional on the climate scenario.</p><p>Scenario 𝑆 𝑖 is in this example modeled as a discrete random variable. Only three scenarios are considered: (A) no change in the extreme flood discharge distribution, (B) moderate increase of extreme discharge, where the mean annual maximum discharge as well as the magnitude of a 100-year event increase by 16% in 100 years and (C) significant increase of extreme discharge, where the mean annual maximum discharge as well as the magnitude of a 100-year event increase by 32% in 100 years. This simple model is selected for illustrative purposes, as it facilitates an understanding of model principles and the interpretation of the results. For real applications, an ensemble of climate scenarios can be used or the parameters of the discharge distribution may be modeled as continuous random process variables. In the model, the random variable scenario 𝑆 𝑖 has three states and its transition probability matrix is the 3x3 unit matrix. All scenarios are a-priori considered to be equally probable, i.e. Pr(𝑆 1 = 𝐴) = Pr(𝑆 1 = 𝐵) = Pr(𝑆 1 = 𝐶) = 1/3.</p><p>The annual maximum discharge 𝐷 𝑖 is described by a Gumbel distribution with mean 𝜇(𝑖) and standard deviation 𝜎(𝑖) conditional on the climate scenario as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Both 𝜇(𝑖) and 𝜎(𝑖) are assumed to be linearly increasing with time; the c.o.v. is 0.8 at all times. We consider that the observed discharges can be used to update the probability of the different scenarios, as indicated by the links from the 𝐷 𝑖 to the observation variables 𝑍 𝑖 . We neglect measurement errors, and the observed discharge 𝑍 𝑖 equals the true discharge 𝐷 𝑖 . Nevertheless, because one only observes the annual discharge maxima and indirectly learns on the climate scenario, the Markov process is a partially observable one. The climate scenario 𝑆 𝑖 is not directly observed here.  The belief state is the probability distribution over the possible demand states. Here, the demand is represented by the scenario 𝑆 𝑖 , which then determines the distribution of extreme discharges. Since scenario 𝑆 𝑖 is a discrete random variable with three states in this example, its full probability distribution 𝑝(𝑠 𝑖 ) is determined by 2 parameters 𝑝 𝐴 = Pr(𝑆 𝑖 = 𝐴) and 𝑝 𝐵 = Pr (𝑆 𝑖 = 𝐵), which form the belief state.</p><p>Risk (expected damage) in the 𝑖th time step for given scenario 𝑆 𝑖 and for given capacity 𝑣 𝑖 equals where 𝑒 = 9 × 10 8 Euro is the exposure, 𝑓 𝐷 𝑖 |𝑆 𝑖 (𝑑) is the conditional Gumbel PDF of annual maximum rainfall (demand) for a given scenario and 𝜅 𝑣 𝑖 (𝑑) is the vulnerability (relative damage) for given capacity of the protection system 𝑣 𝑖 :</p><p>The damage function (the product of vulnerability and exposure 𝑒 • 𝜅 𝑣 𝑖 (𝑑)) is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. The vulnerability is zero for discharges smaller than the capacity of the flood defense system, neglecting the possibility that the flood defense fails at discharges below the design discharge. Without a flood defense, the first damages occur at discharge 𝑑 0 = 3200 m3/s, which corresponds to a 26-year event under current climate conditions. The maximum vulnerability of 1 is reached at discharge 𝑑 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 6000 m3/s, which corresponds to a 1100-year event under current climate conditions. For higher discharges it is assumed that all exposed objects are flooded and the maximum damage of 9 × 10 8 Euro is incurred. Between 𝑑 0 /𝑣 𝑖 and 𝑑 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , the vulnerability increases linearly.  </p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref> shows the probability distribution of the belief state at the decision time 𝑡 = 30 years.</p><p>A belief state here corresponds to a combination of Pr(𝑆 = 𝐴) and Pr(𝑆 = 𝐵). In agreement with the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>, it can be observed that the spread in Pr(𝑆 = 𝐵) is significantly lower than in Pr(𝑆 = 𝐴). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref> shows the conditional probability of belief states at time 𝑡 = 60yr (when the second future decision is to be made), given that the belief state at time 𝑡 = 30yr (when the first future decision is to be made) is Pr(S = A|Z 1 , … Z 30 ) = Pr(S = B|Z 1 , … Z 30 ) = 0.34. A similar pattern can be observed as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref>, but the variability in the belief states is higher. It is not unlikely that scenario A has a posterior probability close to zero or one after collecting data for 60 years. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">17</ref> shows the results of the optimization of the initial capacity 𝑣 0 for different system flexibilities. For an inflexible flood protection system with 𝜑 = 0 , the optimal capacity is 𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 = 5240 m 3 /s, corresponding to a 400-year rainfall event under current climate. For a fully flexible system with 𝜑 = 1, a slightly lower capacity 𝑣 0,𝑜𝑝𝑡 = 5090 m 3 /s is optimal (a 320-year rainfall event in current climate), because the capacity can be adjusted in the future without incurring extra costs. A comparison with the static optimization results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">6</ref> shows that considering future climate change leads to higher optimal design capacities. In the case of an inflexible system, the increase is in the order of 10%, for a fully flexible system the increase is reduced to about 6%. A comparison of the expected rewards 𝑊 0 associated with the three values of flexibility and the corresponding optimal design shows that the optimum is achieved for 𝜑 = 0. The additional cost of flexibility is higher than its benefit, and it is more economical to select inflexible systems together with a conservative design (higher initial capacity) of the flood protection system. To further investigate the characteristics of the decision problem, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18</ref> shows two randomly selected realizations of future annual maximum discharge observations and the related optimal system capacities. The optimal initial capacity at time 𝑡 = 0 corresponds to the capacity found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">17</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">19</ref> shows the conditional optimization of future capacities at time 𝑡 = 30 years for the demand realization from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18a</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">19</ref>: Optimization of future decisions at time 𝑡 = 30 conditionally on original capacity 𝑣 0 and observed demand corresponding to the realization shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18a</ref>.</p><p>In both realizations of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18</ref>, the capacities of the inflexible and partly flexible system are kept constant. The costs of adjusting the capacity of these systems is so high that it does not outweigh the possible increase in the predicted risk due to a higher frequency of flood events. This can be observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">19</ref>, which shows the sudden jump in the cost function.</p><p>The capacity of the fully flexible system is changed at time 𝑡 30 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18a</ref>, when the observations indicate an increase in the likelihood of scenario C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">19c</ref> shows the corresponding optimization, where the objective function is minimized for capacity 𝑣 30,𝑜𝑝𝑡 = 5190 m 3 /s. For the realization in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18b</ref>, the fully flexible system is not changed throughout the lifetime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Value of flexibility for flood risk mitigation measures</head><p>The value of flexibility is determined following the procedure described in Section 3.2. The optimization is repeated with free flexibility, i.e. the coefficients 𝛾(𝜑) representing the price of flexibility in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">28</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">29</ref>) are set equal to 1 for all values of 𝜑. The corresponding optimal initial capacity for varying flexibilities is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref>. The value of flexibility is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">20</ref>. The value of partial flexibility (0.1 ≤ 𝜑 ≤ 0.9) is equal to zero, i.e. it is not worth to implement partly flexible systems if they are more costly than the inflexible ones. The fully flexible system is beneficial as compared to the non-flexible but the benefit is less than 0.1% of the initial costs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>We present a quantitative decision model, which can improve the design and planning of longlife systems that face future uncertainties. The two numerical examples of Sections 4 and 5 demonstrate the applicability of the proposed decision models to the optimization of the capacities of a Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) and a flood protection system. The results show that the optimal design is influenced by the flexibility of the system, i.e. its ability to be modified in the future. By neglecting the flexibility, the planning can lead to suboptimal decisions. In both investigated examples, the associated objective functions are quite flat and sometimes have multiple local minima. As a result, the optimum is rather robust with respect to model assumptions. This facilitates a generalization of the results obtained from the case studies.</p><p>In both examples, the value of flexibility is found to be limited. In the WTTP example, it is up to 6% of the initial design costs, in the flood protection example, it is less than 0.1% of the initial design costs. The latter value is arguably an underestimation, because the amount of information used for learning the likelihood of climate scenarios was very limited. In practice, it can be expected that one will learn significantly more through improved climate models and additional data. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the value of flexibility is limited because of (a) the effect of discounting and (b) the fact that increasing capacity is a no-regret strategy, in particular in the second example. In both examples, the real effect of the flexibility would come at later times in the service life, but because of discounting, the present value of the benefit associated with late changes is small. Increasing capacity is a no-regret strategy, because of the inherent uncertainty associated with extreme events. Adding additional capacity will always lead to a further reduction of risk, therefore the net cost of an overdesign is limited. However, this effect may not be present in other applications. For example, an overdesign of a transportation system, of which parts remain unused later, has no benefits and is thus not a no-regret strategy.</p><p>A comparison of the results from the WWTP example, a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP), with the flood risk example, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), provides insights of the effect of the learning process on the optimal decisions. The more informative future observations are, the higher is the value of flexibility and the more significant adjustments are likely to be made to the system. In the WWTP example, the demand parameter is fully observable and future observations thus significantly reduce uncertainty. As a consequence, the capacity of the WWTP is likely to be changed several times during its lifetime and the value of flexibility is higher. On the contrary, the flood risk example represents a case where the future observations bring only a very limited knowledge on the true state of nature (the parameters of the extreme discharge distribution) and the learning effect is very low. As a consequence, no significant changes of the system are likely in the future and the value of flexibility is low.</p><p>For the purpose of illustration, some of the assumptions made in the examples (e.g. the low number of scenarios utilized in the modeling of the climate change uncertainty in the flood risk example) are simplifying reality. For real applications, the uncertainty in the distribution of the extreme events (due to climate or due to limited historic records) should ideally be modeled with a continuous model of the parameters of probabilistic distribution as shown for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dittes et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, the capacity of the system was modeled as a continuous variable. In practical applications, determining the costs and benefits (risks) associated with each possible capacity is often infeasible. For example, in flood mitigation planning , a large variety of different measures, and combinations thereof, can be implemented (e.g., dykes combined with retention areas, mobile flood barriers, warning systems) and each measure has one or more parameters to be optimized (height of a dyke, volume of the retention, type of the mobile barriers, etc.). In such cases it is only realistic to evaluate a limited number of combinations of these measures. The continuous optimization presented in this paper would thus be replaced with a discrete optimization, similarly to the approach presented in <ref type="bibr">(Špačková and Straub, 2015)</ref>. The discrete formulation would reduce computational cost of the proposed decision model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We propose the use of (Partially Observable) Markov Decision processes for planning of longterm adaptation strategies for civil infrastructure and structures. The approach is applicable to a wide range of systems that have relevant uncertainty in the demand on the system, both at present and in the future. The approach allows identifying the optimal system design taking into account the flexibility of the system, i.e. its ability to be changed in the future without excessive costs.</p><p>For this purpose, we define a quantitative measure of flexibility, based on costs for the initial construction and adjustments. The approach can also help identifying the optimal timing for changing the system as well as the value of flexibility, i.e. the additional costs that a decision maker should be willing to pay for increasing system flexibility. It explicitly includes the fact that also future decisions will be made under uncertainty, even if reduced through additional information. The use of an influence diagrams for graphical representation of the decision process helps communicating the model assumptions.</p><p>The approach is illustrated with two examples considering an optimization of the design of a Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) under uncertain future population growth and the planning a of a flood protection system under climate change uncertainty. In both examples, the value of system flexibility is shown to be limited, because of the fact that changes are likely to be made in the farther future and the associated net present value is small because of discounting. Additionally, increasing the system capacity is a no-regret strategy in both applications, hence an overdesign of the systems still leads to an additional reduction in system risk, even if it is suboptimal. These conditions are, however, not found in all application cases. At present, we therefore have only limited knowledge on the value of flexibility in different adaptation planning problems. Future work should include a systematic study of the value of flexibility under different system characteristics and under different types of uncertainty. The models proposed in this paper can be used for such investigations to derive generalized planning recommendations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Influence diagrams of the planning problem: (a) Fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) (b) Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).Circles denote the random variables, squares the decision nodes and diamonds the utility (benefit/costs) nodes.
