<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper considers the problem of modeling and analyzing the reliability of a system or a component (system)  where the state of the system and the state of process variables influences each other in addition to an exogenous perturbation influence: this is the dynamic reliability. We consider discrete time case, that is the state of the system as well as the state of process variables are observed or measured at discrete time instants. A mathematical tool that shows interesting properties for modeling and analyzing this problem is the so called Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) that permit graphical representation of stochastic processes. Furthermore their learning and inference capabilities can be exploited to take into account experimental data or expert's knowledge. We will show that a complex interaction between system and process on one hand and between system, process and exogenous perturbation on the other hand can simply be represented graphically by a dynamic Bayesian network. With their extended tool, known as influence diagrams (ID) that integrate actions or decisions possibilities, one can analyze and optimize a maintenance policy and/or make reactive decision during an accident by simulating different scenarios of its evolution for instance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The necessity of maintaining systems performance at high level and avoiding catastrophic accidents for systems such as nuclear power plants, airplanes, chemical plants, etc. raises new and challenging aspects of research in dependability <ref type="bibr">(reliability, availability, maintainability, safety, etc.)</ref>. One of such challenging problem is modeling and analyzing dynamic reliability: reliability that takes into account the environment of the system in terms of mutual influence between the state (for instance the system may be functioning, state OK or failed, state OFF) of the system and the state of process variables (pressure, temperature in a tank for instance) and/or exogenous perturbation. The dynamic reliability concept is recognized as a more realistic modeling of the systems for the purposes of reliability, risk and safety analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Labeau et al., 2000)</ref>. Classically, the reliability of a system is defined for the duration of its mission in given conditions. As results, qualitative tools such as fault tree analysis (FTA, a deductive top-down method for analyzing system design and performance) and possibly quantitative tools mainly probabilities calculus and stochastic processes are sufficient for analyzing and assessing important (steady state) dependability measures of the system. Fault tree analysis involves specifying a top event to analyze (such as the failure of the system), followed by identifying all of the associated events that could lead to the top event. But this representation is mainly qualitative (or logical) because the state of the system is generally supposed to be binary stating the fact that the system is operating or not and the fault tree represents just a logical function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pagès et al., 1979)</ref>. This approach has some drawbacks such as not taking into account approximate performance of the system whereas in practice it can happen that a component performs approximately and the overall performance of the system be acceptable. To overcome this, one can use many states than two to represent the functioning modes of a component; the approximate functioning will then be stated in terms of probability. A good candidate mathematical tool for this purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Tchangani, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bobbio et al., 2001)</ref> is Bayesian Networks (BN) that are graphical representation of probabilistic relationships between variables of a knowledge domain. The terminology "Bayesian Networks" comes from the work by Thomas Bayes <ref type="bibr">(Bayes, 1763</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bayes, , 1958) )</ref> in eighteenth century. Its actually development is due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Pearl, 1988)</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jensen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pearl, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Naïm et al., 2004)</ref> for a good introduction to Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network consists of two components: its structure that is a directed acyclic graph defining some relevant relationships between nodes that represent variables of a knowledge domain (for instance components or subsystems) and its parameters that give conditional probability density function (or table) of each node given the evidence on its parents (nodes that have a direct link to the former one), see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jensen, 1999)</ref> for more. A typical Bayesian network is given by Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> where A is the parent node that is relevant, in some sense <ref type="bibr">(causality, correlation, etc.)</ref>, for the knowledge of the node B; to be complete and for a quantitative evaluation purpose, this relevancy (structure) must be completed by a conditional probability table or density { } A B / Pr that is the probability of B knowing the state of A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. A typical example of a Bayesian network</head><p>Modeling a system in terms of reliability integrating an approximate functioning states can benefit of a combination of reliability diagrams or fault tree analysis approach and Bayesian networks theory, see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Tchangani, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bobbio et al., 2001)</ref>. The fault tree analysis can be used as a top level tool to represent interactions in terms of reliability between components or functions of a system; then in a second stage, Bayesian network model can be derived by transforming the AND/OR gates of the fault tree models in probability tables and considering that components can have more than two states of functioning. To illustrate this idea, let us consider a two components redundancy system and its fault tree model depicted on Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The gate AND means that the system (S) is in the state OFF if and only if the two components (C 1 and C 2 ) are in their OFF states respectively; the system will be in the state OK for any other combination of components' states. A Bayesian network model of such system where the components as well as the system may have as many states as possible is given by the Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> where the equivalent of the AND gate is determined by the conditional probability table given by the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[1]. { } k j i c C c C s S 2 2 1 1 , / Pr = = = [1]</formula><p>Besides the fact that a Bayesian network model integrates many functioning states of components, it has another advantage over the fault tree model because it has learning capabilities (see later) that can be used to derive conditional probability density functions or tables using expert knowledge and/or experimental data. Using Bayesian network approach for RAMS (Reliability -Availability -Maintainability -Safety) modeling and analysis as well as for maintenance management policy set up has gained a great interests in recent years in the literature, see for instance <ref type="bibr">(Proccacia et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Tchangani, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bobbio et al., 2001)</ref> and references therein.</p><p>But, fault tree analysis model and related methods (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Labeau et al., 2000)</ref> and references therein) as well as Bayesian networks model presented so far do not take into account the time effect (non stationary components failure rate for instance) or exogenous uncontrollable perturbations effect (the effect of the ambient temperature on the failure rate of an electronic component for instance) or the effect of the state of the process that is taking place in the system or components (for instance the pressure, the temperature and the quantity of matter in a chemical reactor or in a boiler will have an effect on the failure rate of its closing elements (valves) for instance) and so these tools are not adapted for dynamic reliability analysis. Different mathematical tools more or less complex among which are diffusion equation and Monte Carlo analysis (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Labeau et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Marseguerra et al., 1998)</ref> and references therein for an introduction to some of them) or Petri nets  <ref type="bibr">(Chabot et al., 2003)</ref> are used in the literature to analyze dynamic reliability of a system. In this paper, we will use dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) as a mathematical tool to derive a generic approach for modeling and analyzing dynamic reliability; this choice is guided by the following facts: -dynamic Bayesian networks as Bayesian networks briefly recalled in upper lines are graphical representation (and therefore an easy language to understand even for non specialists) of stochastic processes that can represent very complex relationships between variables in a given knowledge domain; -there exists efficient algorithms, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002)</ref>, for learning and inference that make it easy to integrate them into decision support systems; but one must be careful when choosing the appropriate algorithms mainly in the case of continuous dynamic variables, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Naïm et al., 2004)</ref>; -they are widely used and have shown good results in practice in many domains such as knowledge discovery, data mining, fault diagnosis, medical diagnosis, etc; -there exists efficient software (Hugin Explorer, Netica, BayesiaLab to name few) or Toolbox for use with Matlab (see BNT) and other scientific software that render their usage easy in practice even for non specialists; -when extended to influence diagrams by introducing decision nodes and possibly value nodes, they can be used for performance evaluation of maintenance policies or to support planing appropriate actions in the case of accident or catastrophic event because a built model can be used to simulate and obtain the most probable outcome with regard to different scenarios; -etc. Nowadays, dynamic Bayesian networks as a mathematical tool for modeling and anlyzing dynamic reliability is gaining a great interest in the RAMS community, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Weber et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Weber et al., 2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Tchangani et al., 2005)</ref>, a preliminary version of this paper. As stated previously, a dynamic reliability analysis problem is very large and general and so it is important to give the border of the problem under consideration; the context of dynamic reliability problem considered in this paper is defined by the following variables and assumptions. -</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C 2 s C 1 . . 13 12 11 c c c { } k j i c C c C s S 2 2 1 1 , / Pr = = = . .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">{ } s S t s ..., , 2 , 1 ) ( = ∈</formula><p>is the state (discrete) of the system, component (functioning modes) at time instant t; it belongs to a finite set S (the system is normally functioning, approximately functioning, is OFF, is under reparation, etc. for instance).</p><p>-</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">n t x ℜ ∈ ) (</formula><p>is the state (continuous) of the process variables at time instant t; n ℜ denotes a real vector space of dimension n; it could be for instance</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">[ ] T t V t T t P t x ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( =</formula><p>in a chemical reactor or a boiler where P(t) is the pressure, T(t) is the temperature and V(t) is the quantity of the matter and the superscript T stands for the transpose of the corresponding vector or matrix. -</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">l t y ℜ ∈ ) (</formula><p>is the observation or measurements of the process variables available at time instant t; it is a function of the state variables x(t) and l will be less than n in general; it could be the temperature of a chemical reactor obtained by a thermocouple for instance.</p><p>-</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">{ } m a a a A t a ..., , , ) ( 2 1 = ∈</formula><p>is the action of the decision maker at time t that influences the state of the system; there is a finite number of stationary actions defined by the set A (have a cooling effect on a component, to lubricate, to heat up, etc.) available to the decision maker at each instant t; notice that we do not consider the lower controller (PID controller for instance) effect that could have an influence (stabilization for example) on the process variables state. -</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p t w ℜ ∈ ) (</formula><p>is an exogenous perturbation that influences the system and/or the process variables behavior; it could be for instance the effect of ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity, ..) on the failure rate of a component.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">- [ ] ) ( ... ) ( ) ( 1 t t t s π π π = where { } i t s t i = = ) ( Pr ) (</formula><p>π is the probability that the system is in the state i at the time instant t; these probabilities verify the condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= = s i i t 1 1 ) ( π .</formula><p>The purpose of this paper is then to establish a model that describes how all these variables dynamically influence each other. The remainder of this paper is organized as follow: in the second section we will present dynamic Bayesian networks (only the concepts that are relevant to our purpose will be presented; for more formal presentation, the reader is invited to consult specialized literature such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002)</ref>) and their learning and inference capabilities that make them suitable for modeling stochastic processes; the third section will consider the usage of dynamic Bayesian networks for modeling and analyzing dynamic reliability as defined in the introduction section; finally a conclusion is presented in the fourth section. We will illustrate each modeling stage by using a small example to show how dynamic Bayesian networks may be used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Presentation</head><p>Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are directed graphical models of stochastic processes, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002)</ref>, and they generalize Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs) by representing the hidden and observed state in terms of state variables, which can have complex interdependencies. The graphical structure provides an easy way to specify these conditional interdependencies, and hence to provide a compact parameterization of the model. A dynamic Bayesian networks is completely defined by two components: its structure that is a directed acyclic graph (DAG, nodes represented by ovals) representing relationships between variables and its parameters that represent conditional probability density (CPD) in the case of a continuous variable (the allowed values of the variable belong to a continuous set) or conditional probability table (CPT) in the case of a discrete variable (the allowed values of the variable belong to a discrete set that will be in general a finite set). A dynamic Bayesian network structure consists of an intra slice directed acyclic graph and an inter slice directed graph; slices represent time instants to describe dynamic behavior of the system. Intra slice graph models the instantaneous relationships of nodes (a Bayesian Network) and the inter slice graph represents the dynamics of the nodes. Intra slice parameters are CPD and/or CPT of the corresponding Bayesian network and inter slice parameters represent the dynamics of variables on one hand and their relationships with the variables that influence their behavior on the other hand. For instance a dynamic Bayesian network representing a Markov chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hêche et al., 2003)</ref> will have a two time slices graph with inter slice directed graph and no intra slice graph. For instance, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>  ; this matrix must be a stochastic matrix that is it must verify the</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">conditions of equation [2] 1 , 1 = + = + BB BA AB AA p p p p .

But, as stated in the previous lines, dynamic Bayesian networks represent more complex stochastic processes than Markov chains and so algorithms to learn parameters for a dynamic Bayesian networks for a real world problem may be very complex or necessitate an approximation scheme that must be chosen carefully (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Murphy, 2002)</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">s(t-1) s(t) { } B A t s t s , ) ( ), 1 ( ∈ - (b) Dynamicbayesiannetworksmodel AA p BA p AB p BB p = BB BA AB AA p p p p P</formula><p>Most of the time, a system is not autonomous and there is a decision maker that can influence the behavior of the system, this can be taken into account by adding a decision node in a Bayesian network that leads to an influence diagram. Hence, an influence diagram is a simple visual representation of a decision problem. Influence diagrams offer an intuitive way to identify and display the essential elements, including decisions, uncertainties, and objectives, and how they influence each other. An influence diagram or decision graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Howard et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jensen, 1999)</ref> is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that depicts relationships among variables in a decision problem. A typical influence diagram is shown by Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> that describes the following decision problem: to monitor a machine, some sensors are put on it in order to give information about its actual state. According to this information one decides whether to stop the machine for diagnosis or not. Stopping the machine for diagnosis or letting it operates in bad state has a cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5. Example of an influence diagram</head><p>All the nodes necessary to define an influence diagram are shown on the former Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, namely: chance nodes (ovals) that represent uncertain variables impacting the decision problem; decision nodes (rectangles) that represent choices open to a decision maker and value nodes (diamonds) that represent attributes (most of the time numeric attributes) the decision maker cares about. They are an extension of Bayesian networks or dynamic Bayesian networks by adding decision and value nodes. In an influence diagram, an arc or edge relating two chance nodes is called a relevance arc because it indicates that the state of the source node is relevant to the probability distribution of the destination node, arcs from decision nodes to chance nodes are known as influence arcs meaning that the decision influences the outcome of the chance node and arcs into decision nodes (from chance nodes) are called information arcs meaning that the outcome of the chance node will be known at the time the decision is taken. Decision nodes are ordered in time (sequential decisions): there is a direct link between all decision nodes. Finally, arcs from chance or decision nodes into value nodes represent functional links. Relevance arcs may mean many things depending on the problem at hand such as: implication, correlation, causality, etc. The consideration of influence diagrams together with dynamic Bayesian networks in this paper is motivated by the fact that, in general, the main purpose of carrying a (dynamic) reliability study or analysis is to set up a preventive maintenance policy and so integrating decision nodes in the model to represent maintenance actions for instance is justified. In the next paragraph we will consider the properties of dynamic Bayesian networks that make theme suitable for modeling stochastic processes in general and dynamic reliability in particular.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Learning capabilities</head><p>Though learning a dynamic Bayesian network consists in two components: learning its structure and/or learning its parameters; structure learning is more difficult than parameters learning. On the other hand, in many domains such as that we are concerned with in this paper, experts are able to establish the relationships existing between variables; that is why we consider only parameters learning. For parameters learning purpose, there exists efficient algorithms and software, see for instance (BNT) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002)</ref>, that can compute conditional probability table for discrete nodes when experimental data (evidence) exist. Learning conditional probability density functions for continuous nodes necessitates in general discretization and approximation schemes that are not obvious <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002)</ref>. For our problem of dynamic reliability analysis, discretization of continuous variables (temperature, pressure, etc.) may be straightforward because in many cases the experts reason about these variables in terms of thresholds that leads to a natural discretization see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Labeau et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Marseguerra et al., 1998)</ref>. A possible direct application of parameters learning is the estimation of some important dependability performance measures of the system. Indeed, by simulating the obtained model, some parameters such as the steady state probability of being in a particular state or the mean transition time between two given states or the same state can be computed. For instance in the case of Markov and constant transition matrix assumption, learning parameters returns to determining the transition matrix P of the system from experimental data; from this matrix P, one can deduce some steady state performance measures such as: mean up time (MUT), mean time to repair (MTTR), mean time between failures (MTBF), mean life duration, availability, safety, etc. by applying the theory of Markov processes; the following facts are well known from this theory. For an irreducible non periodic Markov chain, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hêche et al., 2003)</ref> for definition, that can represent the behavior of a reparable system (there is no catastrophic states for this system), with transition matrix P, the steady state probability distribution (a row vector of dimension s) exists and is the unique solution of the equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">[4] = ⋅ = s i i P 1 , π π π [4]</formula><p>and it is known that: i π is the probability that the system is in the state i or equivalently the proportion of the time the system spent in the state i (a possible estimation of the mean up time (MUT) or mean time to repair (MTTR)) ; i π 1 is the mean number of transitions (mean time) between two visit of state i (a possible estimation of mean time between failures (MTBF), etc.).</p><p>For an absorbing Markov chain, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hêche et al., 2003)</ref>, that can represent the behavior model of a system with non reparable states and the transition matrix P in the canonical form = Q R I P 0 where I is an identity matrix with dimension equals to the number of absorbent states, R and Q are constant matrices with appropriate dimensions, it is known that the steady state behavior of P t is given by ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">- = ∞ → - 0 0 lim 1 R Q I I t P t and [ ] ( ) 1 - - = = Q I n N ij</formula><p>is called the fundamental matrix. From this observation, the following results are known: -the mean time that the system sojourns in the transient state j when beginning its behavior from the transient state i (a possible estimation of the mean time the system will be functioning approximately for instance) is the element ij n of the fundamental matrix N; -the mean time before attaining an absorbent state (a possible estimation of mean life duration) when beginning its behavior from the transient state i is the sum of the elements of the i th row of the fundamental matrix N; -the probability of being absorbed (a parameter related to the safety) by the absorbent state j when beginning the behavior from the transient state i is the</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">element ij b of the matrix ( ) R Q I NR B 1 - - = = .</formula><p>Notice that for any absorbent Markov chain, the canonical form of its transition matrix P can be simply obtained by rearranging the order of its states. This simple and short recall shows how learning capabilities of dynamic Bayesian networks can be exploited for analyzing the behavior of stochastic systems in many practical domains. In the following paragraph we will consider their inference capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Inference capabilities</head><p>Another possibility offered by dynamic Bayesian networks is the inference; that is propagating a change in the system to estimate the possible outcome and identifying the most probable state of a system or the value of a variable given the observation or measurement. For instance if the exogenous perturbation behavior changes from an estimated nominal behavior, an interesting question could be: what will be the behavior of the system state (prognostics) ? There are algorithms and software (see (BNT) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murphy, 2002)</ref>) that handle such issues. Let us define ) (t O to be a vector containing the states and/or the values of all observed nodes at time t. The general inference problem for dynamic Bayesian networks is to compute the following parameters, equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[5]</ref> {</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">} 2 1 ), ( / ) ( Pr t t O t X ≤</formula><p>≤ τ τ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[5]</ref> where X(t) represents generically the state or the value of any hidden node. The interesting and usually considered cases in practice are filtering ( 2 t t = ), prediction (t&gt; t 2 ) and smoothing (t 1 &lt; t&lt; t 2 ). Once these probabilities are computed, one can use the so called Viterbi decoding scheme (the abduction or most probable explanation) to determine the most probable state s*(t) of the component or node under consideration at the time instant t as given by equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">[6] { } { } 2 1 ), ( / ) ( Pr max arg ) ( * t t O i t s t s S i ≤ ≤ = = ∈ τ τ . [6]</formula><p>The inference offers other possibilities that could permit in practice to react quickly to given evidences; a main parameter against which one fight in practice is the time (or duration). For instance knowing the duration before a likely catastrophic event given current evidence (for instance the failure of a low level controller that causes the states of process variables to grow out of limit causing damage to the system) is important for assistance purpose and this duration can be derived from inference.

For sake of simplicity and without loss of generality we assume that all stochastic processes considered here are Markov Processes (MP), two slices dynamic Bayesian networks (in the case of non Markovian processes only the number of slices will change, more than two slices to take into account the history of the system for a more or less large horizon and the main difficulty will be the complexity of parameters specification and the complexity of learning and inference algorithms). We would like to precise that the Markovian hypothesis is guided by the sake of simplicity for the presentation and the fact that we conceive this paper as a tutorial or introduction of how to use dynamic Bayesian networks for dynamic reliability modeling.

The goal is to find a function, called a policy, which decides what to do (which action to take) in each state, so as to optimize some performance index (e.g. the mean or expected discounted sum of reward).

The failure rate of a component will brutally vary if the perturbation and/or the process state goes beyond/below a threshold for instant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>The problem of modeling and analyzing dynamic reliability has been considered in this paper through dynamic Bayesian networks as the underlying mathematical tool.</p><p>It is shown that their learning and inference capabilities can be exploited in order to take into account experts knowledge and experimental data to estimate the dependability measures and to update beliefs given evidence. The existence of efficient algorithms for learning and inference make it possible to integrate them into decision support system for maintenance purpose or to construct standalone package for analysis and optimization of maintenance policy or as an aid for proactive and reactive decision making, by simulating the possible outcome of different scenarios before and during an abnormal behavior due to the growth of the perturbation or process variables out of limit for instance. The small academic example considered along the paper shows the potentiality of the approach presented so far but this potentiality must be proved by applying the approach to a real world complex example; this is the task for future works and the generality of the approach make it possible to use it in other domains. The need of expertise suggests that the use of this approach for modeling a real world problem will necessitate a multi disciplinary team. Though the exogenous perturbation and the process variables are considered to be continuous, in practice, with most of the existing software, it will be required to sample them on a given domain and this process may lead to some errors in the estimation of dependability measures; this possibility must be taken into account by the modeling team. As stated in the previous sections, the choice of appropriate algorithms and approximation schemes for a practical application may be a matter of expertise and so the modeling process must be carried up by a team comprising experts of dynamic Bayesian networks experts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .Figure 3 .</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
