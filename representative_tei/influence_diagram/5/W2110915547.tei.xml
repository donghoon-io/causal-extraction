<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Weaving areas are the crossing of two or more traffic streams traveling in the same direction. An intense lane changing activity occurs therefore at weaving sections. The lane changes and the complex interactions between the weaving and non-weaving vehicles affect the operation and reduce the capacity of weaving sections in relation to their equivalent basic freeway segments.</p><p>Traffic in weaving sections has been examined through data analysis. Using oblique cumulative vehicle counts from loop detectors at two different weaving sections in the USA, Lee and <ref type="bibr">Cassidy (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Skabardonis and Kim (2010)</ref> show that the bottleneck activation may be triggered by disruptive lane changes from the ramp to the freeway. The effects of the weaving lane changes are further studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rudjanakanoknad and Akaravorakulchai, 2011)</ref> with video data collected on a weaving section in Bangkok. The authors prove that the capacity of the studied weaving section fluctuates over time depending on the number of lane changes and their destination. They observed that an increase of the on-ramp demand induces lane changes from slow to fast lanes and raises consequently the total capacity. They pinpointed also that an augmentation of the off-ramp demand induces lane changes from fast to slow lanes and reduces the capacity of the studied weaving section. Such interactions between weaving vehicles are investigated at a microscopic level in <ref type="bibr">(Sarvi et al., 2011)</ref>. The authors exhibit that the acceleration-deceleration behavior and the decision to change lane of the weaving vehicles are influenced by the surrounding freeway vehicles. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Marczak et al. (2014)</ref> analyzed detailed microscopic trajectory data collected on a weaving section in Grenoble (France). The authors prove that the lane changing behavior depends strongly on the prevailing traffic conditions. When the traffic is saturated the lane changes occur at the beginning of the weaving section independently of their direction. When the traffic conditions are more fluid, the lane changing positions are more distributed along the weaving section. But interestingly, the lane changes still occur at the same location independently of their direction.</p><p>The performance of weaving areas has been also estimated through analytical procedures. The model described in <ref type="bibr">(Lertworawanich and Elefteriadou, 2003)</ref> expresses the capacity of a weaving section as a function of the proportions of origin-destination demands and the speeds of the weaving and non-weaving vehicles. The current HCM 2010 methodology <ref type="bibr">(TRB, 2010)</ref> to design weaving sections is an update of the HCM 2000 methodology <ref type="bibr">(TRB, 2000)</ref> incorporating the improvements developed as part of the NCHRP 3-75 project <ref type="bibr">(Roess and Ulerio, 2009a,b)</ref>. The capacity of weaving sections is directly linked to the number of lane changes expressed as the percentage of the vehicles that desire to make a weaving movement and the length of the weaving section. However, significant differences may exist between empirical observations of weaving sections capacity and estimates from analytical procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cassidy et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rakha and Zhang, 2006)</ref>. Some authors consider microsimulation to be more suitable and reliable to estimate the capacity and predict the operation of various weaving sections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Skabardonis (2002)</ref> calibrates CORSIM with field data measured on eight weaving sections with different configurations. The calibrated CORSIM predicts accurately the operation of the different weaving sections for all configurations and demand patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Calvert and Minderhoud (2012)</ref> generalize the approach initiated originally in <ref type="bibr">(Dijker and Schuurman, 2003)</ref>. The authors test different weaving configurations with SIMONE, a microscopic traffic model, and derive, from the microsimulation results, the corresponding expression of the capacity as a function of the weaving flow rate. Some previous works deal specifically with the development of models to reproduce the interactions between the weaving vehicles. Those interactions are modeled using intelligent agent concepts <ref type="bibr">(Hidas, 2005)</ref>, generic continuous gas-kinetic traffic flows model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ngoduy, 2006)</ref> or gap-acceptance theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahm, 2011)</ref>. an accurate estimation of a weaving section effective capacity. To address this issue, the objective of the present research is to propose a macroscopic model for a freeway weaving section with an allocation scheme similar to Newell-Daganzo model for merges <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Daganzo, 1995)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is a particular representation of the Daganzo model where the capacity of both incoming links is equal and equal to the downstream capacity of the merge (denoted C theo ). The x-axis and the y-axis give the effective flows on the main road and the on-ramp, respectively. In the (F; F)-zone, the merge is free flowing because the demands are lower than the capacity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">✲ ✻ q 1 C theo q 2 C theo (F; F) (C; F) (C;C) (F;C) F: free-flow; C: congestion C a p a c i t y c u r v e α</formula><p>In the (C; F)-zone all the demand from the on-ramp succeeds in merging while the main road is congested.</p><p>In the (F;C)-zone the on-ramp is congested while the main road is free flowing. Finally, in the (C;C)-zone the on-ramp and the main road are congested and the effective flows share the downstream available capacity according to a fixed merge ratio α.</p><p>The proposed model should also incorporate an endogenous expression of the capacity drop. It is postulated that either the slowdowns or the accelerations of the weaving vehicles create voids in the traffic stream that reduce the capacity of the weaving section. It is assumed moreover that there are no spillbacks from bottlenecks downstream of the weaving section. At the macroscopic level, we consider the weaving section as the superposition of two merges and two diverges. We extend the analytical model proposed in <ref type="bibr">(Leclercq et al., 2011)</ref> for the merges by explicitly incorporating (i) the effects of the relaxation at a macroscopic level and (ii) the lane changers' behavior in relation to the prevailing traffic conditions on the target lane. We also adapt the model initially proposed in <ref type="bibr">(Laval, 2009)</ref> to derive analytically the effective capacity of the diverges.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Sarvi and Kuwahara, 2007)</ref>, it is reported that none of the most frequently used commercial tools can correctly reproduce the traffic behavior near discontinuities of the highway network, especially in congested situations. Previous analytical models mostly fit the outcome of extensive microsimulations. Their results are therefore questionable. Our model is built on a rigorous empirical analysis of the lane changing behavior. The previsions of the model are therefore more accurate because they integrate explicitly the real traffic behavior.</p><p>Unlike the microsimulation models, the proposed analytical model will require few parameters. Moreover, those parameters will have a physical interpretation, and hence can be easily calibrated with field data. The proposed model will provide a direct estimate for the effective capacity of a weaving section without requiring any complex simulation runs or elaborated calibration procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ngoduy, 2011)</ref>. It also has operational applications. It could be the basis of a tool for traffic road managers to forecast in real time the operation of a weaving section or evaluate dynamic traffic management strategies such as ramp metering <ref type="bibr">(Zhang and Wang, 2013)</ref>. The estimated capacities could be also incorporated in a dynamic route choice model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ng and Waller, 2012)</ref> to guarantee better previsions.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. A description of the assumptions and the modelling approach are given in Section 2. To quantify the influence of the model parameters, a sensitivity analysis is performed in Section 3. Section 4 finally presents a comparison between the model estimations, empirical observations and microsimulation results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preliminary assumptions and notations and modeling approach</head><p>We consider a one-sided weaving section with one lane on the main road and one auxiliary lane. Lane 1 is assumed to be the main road while lane 2 is assumed to be the auxiliary lane. Each lane obeys a triangular fundamental diagram with a free-flow speed u, a jam density κ and a wave speed in congestion w. The theoretical capacity of each lane is noted C theo . C theo is measured in vehicles/time and equals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C theo = uwκ u + w (1)</formula><p>The demand upstream of the main road (resp. the auxiliary lane) equals λ 1 (resp. λ 2 ). q 1 (resp. q 2 ) is the effective flow coming from the main road (resp. the auxiliary lane) and crossing the weaving section. β 1 and β 2 are respectively the percentages of weaving vehicles driving from and toward the main road. λ i and β i (i ∈ 1, 2 ) are the inputs of the model while q i (i ∈ 1, 2 ) are the outputs of the model, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>We also introduce a constant acceleration rate a. The headways are the time intervals between two successive vehicles. They are assumed to follow a shifted exponential distribution <ref type="bibr">(Gattuso et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chevallier and Leclercq, 2007)</ref> upstream of the weaving section. The headways density function on lane i is thus given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f i H (h) =        δ i e -δ i (h-h x ) if h x ≤ h 0 otherwise (2)</formula><p>Where h x is the minimum safety time headway:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h x = 1 C theo (3)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">δ i = λ i 1 -λ i h x (4)</formula><p>At a macroscopic level, the weaving section is seen as the superposition of two merges and two diverges.</p><p>The global model will be elaborated by (i) specifying traffic behaviors for those local units and by (ii) sketching out its operation when introducing feedbacks between the different components of the overall model. To synthesize the operation of the overall model, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is a scheme presenting the feedbacks between the different components which will be presented later in the chapter. Two mechanisms can dictate the operation of the weaving section when lane i is congested and lane j is in free-flow:</p><p>• Firstly -the weaving vehicles exiting lane i can anticipate their lane change and reduce their speed inside the anticipation zone. If the number of weaving vehicles coming from lane i is high enough, the operation of the weaving section is dictated by the model presented in subsection 2.4, see Block 1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This model gives an effective flow q d i ;</p><p>• Secondly -the weaving vehicles coming from lane j and merging on lane i can also degrade the traffic conditions in lane 1. In this case, the model presented in subsection 2.2 describes the operation of the weaving section, see Block 2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This model gives an effective flow q m i .</p><p>At the end, the output of the model is the effective flow q i on the congested lane i which is the minimum between q d i and q m i . The model is strictly symmetric when considering a situation for which only lane j is saturated.</p><p>When both incoming roads of the weaving section are congested, we assume moreover that the effective flows fairly share the available downstream capacity.   . λ 2 is the demand upstream of the main road (lane 2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), while λ 1 is the demand upstream of the on-ramp (lane 1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v i r λ i λ j β i β j Diverge model lane i: C d i Merge model lane j: C m j q d i j q m i j q d i j = q m i j yes no q d i u, w, κ, D i j , f i j u, w, κ, D ji , f ji L ant η max , a Merge model lane i: C m i q m i q i = min(q d i , q m i ) α j (β i , β j ) α i (β i , β j ) Inputs Block 2 : merge model (subsec. 2.2) Block 1 : diverge + merge model (subsec. 2.4)</formula></div>

The LL-model relies on the assumption that the lane-changers merge on lane 2 at a speed v 0 then accelerate at a constant acceleration rate a. According to the theory developed in (Laval and <ref type="bibr">Daganzo, 2006)</ref>, the accelerations create voids in the traffic stream that reduce the effective capacity of the merge. <ref type="bibr">Leclercq et al. (2011)</ref> evaluate at a large time scale the number of vehicles between two successive insertions using the variational theory. The merging process reduces the effective capacity C m downstream of the merge to Eq.( <ref type="formula">5</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C m = wκ + wηλ 1      w + v 0 a - 1 a (w + v 0 ) 2 + 2aw λ 1 + as 2 w 2 2 (w + v 0 ) 2 + 2aw λ 1 3/2      (5)</formula><p>Assuming that the inserting positions and the inserting times are independent, s, the standard deviation of their</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">sum is s = s 2 h + 2s 2</formula><p>x w 2 where s h and s x are the standard deviations of the headways distribution and the inserting positions distribution, respectively. <ref type="bibr">Leclercq et al. (2011)</ref> distinguish two situations whether lane 1 is free flowing or not. If lane 1 is in freeflow, it is assumed that the mergers instantaneously adapt the mean speed of the main road. This assumption leads to v 0 = wq 2 wκq 2 and C m becomes a function of q 2 . As C m is shared by λ 1 and q 2 , one obtains Eq.6 and q 2 is numerically computed by solving this equation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C m (q 2 ) = λ 1 + q 2 (6)</formula><p>In case of queuing on both incoming links, the effective flows share the available downstream capacity according to a fixed merge ratio α <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Daganzo, 1995)</ref>. Although there is no general definition of the merge-ratio <ref type="bibr">(Torné et al., 2014)</ref>, in the present paper, α is the ratio between both incoming link capacities. The merge ratio holds thus q 1 = αq 2 . As the on-ramp is saturated, the merging speed is simply v 0 = wq 1 wκq 1 and C m becomes a function of q 1 . The effective flows are computed solving Eq. 7.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C m (q 1 ) = 1 + 1 α q 1 (7)</formula><p>The relaxation phenomenon takes place when vehicles involved in a lane change accept shorter spacings then gradually adapt their speed to reach their equilibrium spacings. The merging vehicles in relaxation induce non-equilibrium traffic states that increase the effective flow. The LL-model does not take into account this phenomenon and, as a consequence, it underestimates the effective capacity of the merge. To address this issue we add a dynamic relaxation factor η to the fundamental diagram downstream of the merge, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>. If the number of vehicles coming from the unsaturated lane is low, the relaxation process affects only a couple of vehicles and therefore has little impact at a macroscopic level. We assume that η is a linear increasing function of λ 1 which is the demand coming from the on-ramp. The relaxation function is given by a single parameter η max corresponding to the maximum allowed relaxation parameter. We have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">η(λ ) =        1 if λ ≤ λ c 1 η max -1 αq α -λ c 1 (λ -λ c 1 ) + 1 elseif (8)</formula><p>Where q α is the flow on the main road when both incoming links of the merge are saturated.</p><p>Moreover Leclercq et al. ( <ref type="formula">2011</ref>) expressed s x simply as a function of the on-ramp length. They suppose therefore that the merging behavior depends on the road configuration but not on the prevailing traffic conditions on the target lane. However, recent empirical studies proved that either the road configuration or the traffic conditions influence the merging behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daamen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marczak et al., 2013)</ref>. We address this issue by adjusting the standard deviation according to the mean speed on the target lane v 2 . The positions of the lane changes, X , are assumed to follow a theoretical distribution D 12 that depends on a vector of parameters p 12 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X ∼ D 12 (p 12 )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Where p 12 is a function of the effective flow on the target lane, p 12 = f 12 (q 2 ). D 12 and f 12 will be adjusted from empirical considerations later in the paper.</p><p>s h is a parameter of the original LL-model. To reduce the number of parameters of our model, we propose to adjust endogenously s h as a function of the demand on the on-ramp. We have assumed that the headways follow a shifted exponential distribution. s h can be directly derived from Eq.( <ref type="formula">2</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">s h (λ 1 ) = 1 δ 12 = 1 λ 1 - 1 C theo (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Finally we have the following expression of the effective capacity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">C m = wηκ + wηκλ 12      w + v 0 a - 1 a (w + v 0 ) 2 + 2aw λ 1 + as(λ 1 ) 2 w 2 2 (w + v 0 ) 2 + 2aw λ 1 3/2     <label>(11)</label></formula><p>With</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">s = 1 λ 1 - 1 C theo 2 + 2var(X ) w 2 (12)</formula><p>It is worth noting that the shape of the headways distribution is not important only the standard deviation is. We have performed extensive numerical analysis for admissible ranges of parameters for q 2 between 0 and C theo . It appears that the upper and lower bounds of Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) are positive and negative, respectively. As Eqs.( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) are continuous function of q 2 , they admit at least one solution. The trucks are assumed to drive at a speed v r , which is lower than u, inside the uphill segment. Assuming that the exiting vehicles anticipate their maneuver inside a L ant -long anticipation zone and slow down at a speed v r this framework was further elaborated in the case of a simple diverging section with bounded accelerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Marczak and Buisson, 2014)</ref>, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4a</ref>. The headways between two successive slow moving vehicles are moreover assumed to be constant in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Marczak and Buisson, 2014)</ref> while there are random in <ref type="bibr">(Laval, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>

If λ 1 is high enough, the moving bottlenecks introduce shockwaves that propagate upstream at a wave speed v and reduce the effective flow at the diverging point, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>. The expression given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Marczak and Buisson, 2014)</ref> underestimates the capacity of the diverging junction for lower rates of slow moving vehicles. We consider therefore the analytical model presented in <ref type="bibr">(Laval, 2009)</ref>. Considering the renewal theory, Laval (2009) expresses the distribution of the headways between two successive slow moving vehicles at the beginning of the anticipation zone. The headways follow an exponential distribution whose density function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">f H (h) =        l 1 e -l 1 h if h ≤ τ(v r ) e τ(v r )(l 0 -l 1 ) l 0 e -l 0 h if h &gt; τ(v r )<label>(13)</label></formula><p>With</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">τ(v r ) = L ant v r + w v r w l 0 = β 1 uwκ u + w , l 1 = β 1 v r wκ v r + w (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>Where τ is the disturbance time introduced by a slow moving vehicle and l 0 and l 1 are the mean slow moving vehicles arrival rate at the beginning of the anticipation zone when the flow at this point is C theo or q v r , respectively, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the effective capacity of the diverge, C d is simply given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">C d = 1 β 1 H (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>Where H is the mean headway between two successive exiting vehicles. H can be immediately derived from Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">13</ref>). Note that randomly drawn lane changing positions do not influence the capacity of the diverge. Indeed, we assume that all the exiting vehicles drive at v r . The drop in capacity occurs therefore at the beginning of the anticipation zone independently of the lane changing positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Combining one upstream diverge with the associated downstream merge</head><p>From the two previous steps we have the capacity of a merge C m and the capacity of a diverge C d . The next step is to combine a diverge on lane 1 with a merge on lane 2, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>. The developments presented in this section will be identical when combining one merge on lane 1 and one diverge on lane 2. The main road of the merge is assumed to be lane 2. We assume moreover in this subsection that λ 2 is low enough to prevent congestion on lane 2 because the situation for which lane 2 is saturated can be analytically solved with the merge model presented in subsection 2.2. The lane changing vehicles coming from lane 1 temporarily drive at v r inside the anticipation zone. The demand on lane 1 is high enough to initiate shockwaves that reduce the effective flow at the diverging point.</p><p>a) There are two links, respectively denoted d 1 and d 2 , downstream of the diverge on lane 1, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>. No capacity reduction occurs downstream of d 1 . Therefore, the effective capacity of d 1 equals C theo . Because of the merging process, the capacity on d 2 is reduced to C m , which is the capacity given by the merge model for a fixed λ 2 . The merge model estimates also the effective lane changing flow q m 12 coming from lane 2, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>. But for a given v r , the diverge model proposes another lane changing flow q d 12 . As u, w, κ, L ant , η max and a are fixed, we propose to adjust v r to ensure equality between q m 12 and q d 12 . v r is found so that the following equation is satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">λ 1 λ 2 q e 12 d 1 d 2 q 1 C d C m L ant b) v r λ 1 , β 1 λ 2 Inputs Diverge model: C d Merge model: C m q d 12 q m 12 q d 12 = q m 12 yes no q 1 u, w, κ, D 12 , f 12 L ant η max , a</formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">λ 2 + β 1 C d (v r ) = C m (v r , s d (v r ))<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Once again, assuming that the headways between two successive lane changes and the lane changing positions are independent, one can write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">s d (v r ) = s 2 H + 2var(X ) w 2 (17)</formula><p>Where s H is the standard deviation of the headways distribution given by Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">13</ref>).</p><p>v r was a parameter of the diverge model presented in subsection 2.3. When combining a diverge and a merge v r is no longer a parameter of the model, but v r is adjusted endogenously as a function of λ 2 . This is the feedback between the different models. One again we have performed extensive numerical resolutions for an admissible range of parameters. It appears that Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">16</ref>) always admits a solution. Interestingly, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows that v r is a decreasing function of λ 2 . When the flow is higher on lane 2, the drivers coming from lane 1 anticipate more their lane changes because the offered gaps on lane 2 are smaller and the lane changes are therefore more difficult. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">The overall model</head><p>The goal now is to describe the complete analytical model for the weaving section. At a macroscopic level, the weaving section is represented as the superposition of two merges and two diverges.</p><p>When both incoming roads are congested, we assume moreover that the effective flows fairly share the available downstream capacity according to a fixed priority ratio which is equal to 1 and independent of the percentages of weaving flows β 1 and β 2 . As a consequence the merge-ratios α 1 and α 2 are dynamic and dependent on β 1 and β 2 . This is a strong assumption because usually α is supposed independent of the upstream demand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bar-Gera and Ahn (2010)</ref> show empirically that the merge-ratios for independent merges can be reasonably estimated by the ratios between the number of lanes on the main road and the number of lanes on the onramp. The findings of this study indicate that the merge-ratios depend on the geometrical configuration of the merge area and consequently on the infrastructure supply. But the authors pinpoint some residual differences between merge-ratios and lane-ratios. They suggest therefore that other factors influence the merge-ratios.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Reina and Ahn (2014)</ref> developed a formulation of merge-ratios using lane flow distribution (LFD). The authors showed that the proposed LFD-based model can capture variation in merge-ratios with respect to the traffic conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chevallier and Leclercq (2007)</ref> considered in simulation a dynamic priority sharing ratio to reproduce the drivers' aggressiveness. Moreover these studies are for independent merges and not for weaving sections. Note that this assumption on α 1 and α 2 can be relaxed without changing the model structure when further and specific data for weavings will be collected.</p><p>In case of continuous queuing on both incoming links, one can guarantee the consistency of the effective flow estimated by both merge models by writing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">       q α 1 = α 2 q α 2 β 1 (a) q α 2 = α 1 q α 1 β 2 (b) (18)</formula><p>Interestingly, if Eq. ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>)(a) and (b) are verified they yield the following simple condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">α 1 α 2 = β 1 β 2 (19)</formula><p>One can assume moreover that α 1 and α 2 are proportional and that there is a constant µ such that :</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">α 2 = µα 1 (20)</formula><p>One can write therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">α 1 = β 1 β 2 µ , α 2 = µβ 1 β 2 (21)</formula><p>The remaining question to adjust endogenously α 1 and α 2 is the estimation of µ. We also assume that the effective flows on lane 1 and lane 2 compete to fairly share the downstream capacity on a one-to-one basis. One should have consequently:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">min q α 1 , α 2 q α 2 β 1 = min q α 2 , α 1 q α 1 β 2 (22)</formula><p>One can easily estimate µ solving Eq.( <ref type="formula">22</ref>).</p><p>Previous studies using micro-simulation to estimate the capacity of a weaving section, pinpointed that the length of the weaving section is a key factor influencing its capacity <ref type="bibr">(Dijker and Schuurman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Calvert and Minderhoud, 2012)</ref>. Our model does not include explicitly the length of the weaving section as a parameter.</p><p>It is, however, important to stress that the length is implicitly included in the distribution of the lane changing positions. A longer weaving section may indeed introduce different lane changing behaviors and therefore a different distribution of the lane changing positions. As the standard deviation of this distribution is a parameter of the model, the length of the weaving section is implicitly taken into account in the analytical expression of the capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Sensitivity analysis</head><p>A sensitivity analysis is now performed to determine the contribution of the different parameters to the capacity drop. Let us denote C the effective capacity of the weaving section. We define C as the effective flow passing the weaving section when both lane 1 and lane 2 are saturated. As we assumed that the main road and the auxiliary lane obey the same fundamental diagram, we have simply C = 2C theo . The sensitivity to the parameters and the relative capacity drop are quantified with c the complement of the ratio between the effective capacity and the theoretical capacity <ref type="bibr">(Leclercq et al., 2011)</ref>. We focus the sensitivity analysis on the acceleration rate a, the maximum relaxation factor η max and the length of the anticipation zone L ant . The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. The dotted lines represent c for the situation with randomly drawn headways between two successive lane changes and a fixed lane changing position. The continuous lines represent c for randomly drawn headways and lane changing positions. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> : Sensitivity analysis: influence on c, the relative capacity drop of the weaving section, of a) the acceleration rate a, b) the maximum relaxation factor η max , c) the length of the anticipation zone L ant , and d) the percentages of weaving flows β 1 and β 2 . We have chosen β 1 = 0.55 and β 2 = 0.59 in the first three cases while we have fixed a = 2 m/s 2 , η max = 1.2, L ant = 20 m, w = 5.4 m/s and κ = 0.15 veh/m to study the sensibility to β 1 and β 2</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7a</ref> shows the influence of a on the relative capacity drop for different values of η max . Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref> presents the influence of η max on the capacity drop for different values of a. It appears that increasing a or η max increases the effective capacity and reduces consequently c. When a is high, the voids created by the acceleration process in the traffic stream are smaller. The effective flow is therefore higher. η max is a dilatation factor of the fundamental diagram. It increases the effective flow crossing the weaving section. Figure <ref type="figure">7c</ref> focuses on L ant for different values of a. L ant hardly influences the effective capacity. It appears moreover that the capacity drop is lower when the lane changing positions are randomly drawn. The effective capacity of the weaving section is therefore higher. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) proves that one increases the standard deviation when considering randomly drawn headways and lane changing positions. <ref type="bibr">Leclercq et al. (2011)</ref> show that the standard deviation reduces the relative capacity drop.</p><p>The capacity of a weaving section varies with respect to the percentages of weaving flows <ref type="bibr">(Lertworawanich and Elefteriadou, 2003)</ref>. We analyze therefore the sensitivity of the model to β 1 and β 2 . Figure <ref type="figure">7d</ref> is an illustration of the (β 1 , β 2 ) plane which is split in different regions according to the relative capacity drop c.</p><p>These regions are bounded by isolines of c. First of all, one can observe that c is not symmetrical with respect to β 1 and β 2 . The standard deviation of the lane changing positions is a parameter of the model. The position distribution of the lane changes towards the auxiliary lane differs from that towards the main road because their respective parameters are not the same, see Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. One observes therefore asymmetrical effects on c because those distributions, and hence the standard deviations, are different. For the lower values of β 1 and β 2 , c is less than 5%. c increases with increasing β 1 and β 2 : the higher the number of weaving vehicles, the higher the drop in capacity. For the higher values of β 1 and β 2 , less than 45% of the theoretical capacity are used. First of all, we fit empirically the distribution D of the lane changing positions. The data have been aggregated using the lane changing speed. We assume that this speed gives an accurate indication of the prevailing traffic conditions on the target lane. The data have been fitted with different theoretical distributions inside each speed class. It appears that the Gamma distribution fits the best the empirical observations. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> presents the Maximum Likelihood Estimations for the parameters of the adjusted distribution. a i→ j and b i→ j are the shape parameter and the scale parameter, respectively, of the Gamma distribution. We also represent the confidence intervals for a i→ j and b i→ j at a 5% significance level. Then a i→ j and b i→ j have been adjusted as functions of the speed with the simplest polynomial. The solid lines in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> are the adjusted polynomials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Comparison with empirical observations</head><p>Microscopic trajectory data allow us to trace each vehicle from its origin at the beginning of the weaving section to its destination at the end of the weaving section. We can therefore have an accurate estimation of β 1 and β 2 . However we do not have enough data for a given couple of β 1 and β 2 . Moreover, we cannot observe all the possible capacities because of the numerous combinations of percentages of weaving vehicles. To address this issue, we extracted from the video recordings some periods for which the weaving section is either free flowing or an an active bottleneck. The bottleneck is located at the start of the block line between the main road and the auxiliary lane. When the bottleneck is active, the congestion moves upstream (i) only on the rightmost lane on the main road or (ii) on the auxiliary lane and the rightmost lane. We have taken only the situations in congestion for which the mean speed is lower than 40 km/h (11 m/s). We have computed from the trajectories the time instants at which the vehicles pass through a fictive detector located at the start of the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparison with simulation results</head><p>A second option for questioning our analytical model is to compare it with simulation results. The simulated weaving vehicles will temporarily consider their leader on the adjacent lane if the mean speed on the actual lane is higher than the mean speed on the adjacent lane. The leader on the adjacent lane is the closest vehicle driving in front of the considered weaving vehicle. The car following rule is an extension to Newell ′ s car-following model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Newell, 2002)</ref> with a relaxation term <ref type="bibr">(Laval and Leclercq, 2007)</ref> and bounded acceleration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Leclercq, 2007)</ref>. We redirect our readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Leclercq et al., 2007)</ref> for a more precise description of the car-following model. The lane changing model simply expresses the probability of changing lane as a function of the longitudinal position. The lane changing positions follow a Gamma distribution. The parameters of the distribution are adjusted according to the results presented in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. The demands upstream of the weaving section are constant and the headways upstream of the weaving section are assumed to follow a shifted exponential distribution whose density function is given by Eq.( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). We run 1500 replications. For each replication, we simulate 15 minutes of data. Then, we construct the curve of cumulative vehicles count (CVC) 1000 m downstream of the weaving section according to the origin of the vehicles. Finally, the effective capacity is the long-term average, measured with the slope of the CVC during the last 6 minutes of the simulation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presents a parsimonious macroscopic model for a freeway weaving section with an allocation scheme similar to the Newell Daganzo model and an endogenous expression of the capacity drop. The paper proposes an explicit formulation of the relation between microscopic interactions related to the weaving activity and their impact on the capacity at a macroscopic level. It is postulated in our study that either the slowdowns or the accelerations of the weaving vehicles create voids in the traffic stream, and that these voids reduce the capacity of the weaving section. We simply consider a theoretical weaving section as the superposition of two merges and two diverges. We assume therefore that the operation of the weaving section is dictated either by the operation of a single merge or by the operation of a single diverge. A parsimonious formulation of the capacity that depends only on six parameters is proposed. The acceleration and the relaxation parameter strongly influence the effective capacity, whereas the length of the anticipation zone hardly influences the capacity. The analytical expression of the capacity accords well with empirical observations and simulation results.</p><p>The work presented in this paper assumed some simplifying assumptions. The theory was developed for a very simple weaving section with one lane on the main road and one auxiliary lane. The traffic upstream of the weaving section is consequently strictly FIFO. The proposed model has to be further developed for other weaving configurations with more lanes on the main road. The merge model should specifically be generalized for configurations with more lanes on the main road. Extensions to multi-lanes freeways have been discussed in <ref type="bibr">(Leclercq et al., 2011)</ref>. But it is assumed that the capacity drop occurs (i) only on the shoulder lane while the other lanes are free flowing or (ii) identically on all downstream lanes. The model gives a bound of the capacity drop but it cannot reproduce properly lane flow distributions because it does not consider the discretionary lane changes that may reduce that capacity on the main road <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cassidy and Rudjanakanoknad, 2005)</ref>. Research has to continue to integrate explicitly the discretionary lane changes in the analytical expression of a multilanes merge capacity. Similarly, we have considered a diverge with one lane of the main road. The traffic is consequently strictly FIFO. More research is needed to estimate the effective capacity of a non-FIFO diverge with more lanes on the main road. Then the enhanced merge and diverge models should be aggregated in order to build a generalized model for weaving sections.</p><p>The proposed model has been compared to a single dataset. Future research should be performed to collect field data on different weaving sections and compare the capacities predicted by the model to field-measured capacities. We have made a strong assumption on the priority ratio when both incoming roads are congested assuming that it equals 1, independently of the percentages of weaving flows. This is in accordance to what was observed on the studied weaving section but must be compared to reality in more cases. Future empirical researches should estimate how the weaving ratio is linked to the percentages of weaving flows. As in <ref type="bibr">(Sun and Elefteriadou, 2012)</ref> an instrumented vehicle-based experiment could be also designed to observe the drivers' action during the lane changes and have a deeper understanding of the anticipation behavior during those maneuvers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Global allocation scheme for the Newell-Daganzo's model</figDesc></figure>
