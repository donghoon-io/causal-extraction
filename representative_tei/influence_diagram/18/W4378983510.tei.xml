<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The range of early childhood from birth to eight years is a critical and at the same time strategic age range in the educational process that can affect the process and educational outcomes at a later stage. This period is a conducive period to grow, develop and teach various potential basic abilities of children, one of which is training independence.</p><p>Independence is an attitude that is acquired cumulatively through the process that a person experiences in his development, in the process towards independence the individual learns to deal with various situations in his social environment until he can think and take appropriate action to overcome each situation. Independence is the ability of children to do activities alone or be able to stand alone in various things. Actually, from an early age, children naturally have the urge to be independent. They sometimes prefer to be able to take care of themselves rather than be served. A child who has a sense of independence will be able to adjust to environmental circumstances and can overcome difficulties that occur. Children who have high independence will have emotional stability and steady resilience in the face of challenges and pressures. The characteristics of early childhood independence include children being able to do all their activities even though they are still under adult supervision, can make decisions and choices according to the views they get from the behaviour or actions of those around them, can socialize with others without the need for parental company and can control their emotions and even empathize with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wiyani (2014)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of independence must begin to grow into children from an early age. This is important because there is a tendency for parents today to provide somewhat excessive protection to their children. As a result, children have a high dependence on their parents. This does not mean that parental protection is not important, but it should be understood that excessive protection is not good. An important attitude that should be developed by parents is to provide ample opportunities for children to develop and process. Parental intervention is only carried out if indeed the child's condition is expected to be realized. Successful individuals usually have independence since childhood. They are used to dealing with many obstacles and challenges. Independent nature that allows them to be steadfast in facing various challenges so that they eventually reap success (Naim, 2012). In parenting, parents can not only communicate facts, ideas and knowledge but also help grow the child's personality. The role of parents is a pattern of interaction between parents and children. More clearly, namely how the attitude or behaviour of parents when interacting with children. Including how to apply rules, teach values or norms, give attention and affection, and show good attitudes and behaviour, so that they are used as examples or role models for their children.</p><p>Family parenting is very influential on the formation of children's character. Each family usually has a different parenting style. Parenting also affects the success of the family in transferring and instilling religious values, kindness, and norms that apply in society. Parenting includes interactions between parents and children in meeting physical and psychological needs.</p><p>Based on preliminary observations of kindergarten children. B Sungai Bilu Village there are still many parents who provide education only at home because of several kindergarten schools. B, Sungai Bilu Village only in Khadijah Kindergarten school which is actively going down the school with permission from parents to take and wait until school, although at that time some schools were closed for reasons during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even so, children who are off (at home) are still given assignments from school to do at home as part of learning, namely in Aisyah Kindergarten, the Leader's Kindergarten, Al-Ansar Kindergarten, Al-Ikhwan Kindergarten, and Abdurahman Kindergarten. From these initial observations, it turns out that there are still children who are not independent, both at school and home, which can be seen when eating children are still fed by their parents, when wearing socks children are still assisted by parents, children wearing shoes are still assisted by parents, children are still waiting at school and many indications that reflect the lack of independence of early childhood both at school and at home. Indeed, parents can foster children's independence by providing opportunities to do something that they can do themselves. But when the child needs help, make sure the parents help him. If in establishing a relationship between children and parents there is a good attitude/action, it can produce independence. But on the contrary, if parents caring for their children behave wrongly, then children in their development will experience shame and doubt. Therefore, the independence of the child is very necessary because the child can become more responsible in meeting his needs. Children who are normally independent will tend to be more positive in the future. Independent children tend to excel because in completing their tasks they are no longer dependent on others such as teachers and parents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Wiyani (2013)</ref> Character education should start with children in the early age phase. That age is proven to greatly determine the child's ability to develop his potential. Therefore, prospective educators must instil good potential in their students. This means that teachers must provide good examples or models for children so that what is imitated by children gets a positive response from society and children can develop their potential optimally. A child's future is also determined since he gets proper education at an early age, which is why, a variety of early childhood education emerges which is usually known as character education. This early age begins when the child is still in the womb or before birth (prenatal) until the age of 6 years. Early childhood a child starting from birth to the age of six years is a very decisive age in the formation of a child's character and personality. This is in line with the opinion expressed by one of the experts. A child's future is also determined since he gets proper education at an early age, which is why, a variety of early childhood education emerges which is usually known as character education.</p><p>Discipline in the preschool environment needs to be instilled in early childhood in managing their behaviour because children will face all influences from the outside environment. Discipline directs a person's behaviour in such a way that it can be accepted by people around him according to the rules that apply to him. In this case, the teacher must teach how to behave well with others. If a child from an early age has been instilled with discipline continuously, it will be easy for children to carry out rules and be able to adjust themselves to the environment.</p><p>Wiyani (2013) divides disciplines into three, namely discipline, discipline, obedience, and field of study. Discipline is how we train the mind and character of a child gradually so that children can become a person who has self-control and eventually can socialize and be accepted by society. Therefore, children's education cannot be separated from their families because the family is the first place children learn to express themselves as creatures in interacting with their groups. To achieve this desire, parents certainly have a major role because they are the main educators and examples for children before knowing about education outside the family. However, sometimes parents do not know what their attitude is in educating their children. In this case, parents must be able to play a role to be able to direct children to the developmental period. Because inevitably parents have a responsibility to children to educate them. Do not let children become the wrong care because their souls are still labile, especially in kindergarten school-age children need positive direction and guidance by providing protection and example through the intensity of communication carried out by parents.</p><p>Parents are said to be educators first because from them the first child gets an education. It is said to be the main educator because parental education becomes the basis of the development and life of children when they grow up. However, in working parents, usually, childcare indirectly switches to their grandparents or relatives who can be entrusted, the reason that children can learn from adults. When children do something, there are still caregivers accompanying, directing and educating them indirectly. Each parent has a different way of raising children, the ways and attitudes shown by parents when educating their children show the type of parenting style used that will determine the independence of children.</p><p>Parents hope that their children can grow well and have good character, especially in independence. Working parents still expect their children to be independent when left behind during work, they expect children to be able to do everything themselves and when cared for by close relatives, children can learn with the surrounding environment, have a lot of insight and can be independent because they feel that children are cared for even though they are not entirely from their parents but relatives as parental guardians. As for parents who take care of their children, they also have the hope to make children independent so that they will become resilient children in the future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The Influence of the Role of Parents on Children's Independence</head><p>The results of the study show that the influence of the role of parents on children's independence. The relationship between these two variables can be explained that the role of parents usually cannot be separated in the development of family members, because parents are part of a large family and nuclear family which usually consists of father, mother and children <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anurraga, 2012)</ref>. While child independence is an aspect that develops in everyone, the form is very diverse, depending on the development process and learning process experienced by a person. Independence contains understanding, having an appreciation / spirit to be better and confident, managing the mind to analyze problems and make decisions to act, discipline and responsibility, not depending on others <ref type="bibr">(Zainul, 2009: 19)</ref>. The results of this study are reinforced by previous research which concluded that there is a role for parents on independence (Syifa, N., Rachman, A., &amp; Asniwati, A., 2023). Parental involvement in the development of early childhood character is through building positive communication (Maimunah, Aslamiah, &amp; Ahmad Suriansyah, 2018) which is defined as an activity that is always carried out by everyone irrespective of their location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Influence of Parenting on Children's Independence</head><p>The results of the study show that the influence of parenting on children's independence. Ali (2017) that a person's development also takes place gradually according to the level of independence. So parents also play their roles according to the characteristics of their children. To form children's independence, parents need to train children's independence because independence is very important. Here are some ways parents can do to train children's independence by maintaining emotional closeness with children. So independence education for children in the family is the beginning and center for all children's growth / development to become independent adults, thus becoming the rights and obligations of parents as the main responsible for educating their children. The task of parents is to equip children by providing supervision that can help them face life successfully. Parenting is basically created by the interaction between parents and children in daily relationships that evolve over time, so that parents will produce children sealiran, because parents not only teach with words, examples but also with advice that is easy for children to understand. Katrena is a parenting style carried out by parents allows children to be responsible, become a good society, have good character. What parents do when the child is sick, when the child does not want to eat, when sad, when crying, when acting aggressively, or when the child lies. In this case, parents are required to be better prepared in carrying out the role of parenting for children so that they have life skills and can build independence. The results of the study concluded that parenting style has a significant influence on children's discipline (Maudyta, D., Aslamiah, A., &amp; Wahdini, E.,2023; Syifa, N., Rachman, A., &amp; Asniwati, A, 2023; Putri, H., Suriansyah, A., &amp; Wahdini, E,2019; Sunarty, K, 2016; Pratiwi, K. E., 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Influence of Parenting on Children's Independence</head><p>The results of the study show that the influence of the role of parents on child discipline. In essence, early childhood discipline is a self-control of the behavior of children aged 0-6 years in behaving in accordance with applicable provisions (in the form of an order of values of obedience and compliance with rules, morals, religious norms, and rules at home or at school), both written and unwritten. So in simple terms, early childhood discipline is basically an attitude of obedience and obedience to the applicable rules, both at home, school, and community carried out by children aged 0-6 years which is called the golden age period. The purpose of the learning discipline in this study is good study preparation, attention to subject matter, completing assignments on time, obeying and obeying school rules, and planning study schedules. This can be described as students can manage time well, enter class according to a set schedule, carry out activities at school according to teacher instructions and school rules, carry out class pickets before learning activities begin, ask permission if unable to attend learning activities at school. Discipline needs to be instilled in early childhood. Good self-discipline is expected to make children behave according to norms and benefit from their actions. This is supported by the results of research which states that the implementation of discipline and independence character education is very important for early childhood (Lidya, A., Suriansyah, A., &amp; Aslamiah, A, 2022; Purwanti, R., Suriansyah, A., &amp; Rafianti, W. R. 2021; Yanti, N. H., 2021)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Influence of Parenting on Child Discipline</head><p>The results of the study show that there is an influence of parenting variables on child discipline variables that state parental parenting has a significant influence on child discipline. Parenting is an overall interaction between parents and children, where parents who encourage children by changing behavior, knowledge, and values that are considered most appropriate for parents so that children can be independent, grow and develop healthily and optimally, have curiosity, friendship, and are oriented to success <ref type="bibr">(Tridonanto, 2014)</ref>. In society itself, parenting is better understood how parents nurture and educate children starting from their basic needs to the physical and psychological needs of children, including affection needs. The way or style used by parents in parenting children will also determine the behavior of their children later. The results of previous studies concluded that the Implementation of Discipline Character Education is very important for early childhood (Alhan, K., &amp; Supriyani, S, 2023; Krobo, A., 2020; Rakhmawati, E., Maulia, D., Suyati, T., &amp; Suharno, A,2019).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The Influence of Child Discipline on Children's Independence</head><p>The results of the study show that there is an influence of child discipline variables on child independence variables that state child discipline has a significant influence on child independence. habituation and discipline of children to do things regularly and in accordance with procedures formed from an early age. In addition to discipline, environment and genetics affect children's independence. However, the family environment has a greater influence on the independence of children. Parents can train children's independence from an early age by giving children the opportunity to do something that they can do on their own. Independence can help children become more confident in doing an activity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">The Influence of the Role of Parents on Independence through Child Discipline</head><p>The results of the study show the influence of the role of parents (X1) through child discipline (Z) on child independence (Y). There are many variations and models that are certainly used by parents in every educating and nurturing their children. Important aspects of this parenting style according to Irawati (2009) at least include communication between parents and children, parental authority, and parental example. Ali (2017) that a person's development also takes place gradually according to the level of independence. So parents also play their roles according to the characteristics of their children. Previous research has concluded that Implementation of independence Character Education is very important for early childhood (Alhan, K., &amp; Supriyani, S, 2023; Krobo, A., 2020; Rakhmawati, E., Maulia, D., Suyati, T., &amp; Suharno, A,2019).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">The Influence of Parenting on Independence Through Child Discipline</head><p>The results of the study show the Influence of Parenting on Independence Through Child Discipline. The relationship between the two parenting variables with children's independence can be explained that the parenting style of parents (father and mother) plays a real and large role in shaping the character of early childhood. For example, excessive parental tolerance and excessive maintenance to children usually make children spoiled. Or vice versa, attitudes and treatment too harsh from parents to children can hinder the achievement of independence. Because children obey not because of their consciousness but based on fear of their parents. Thus if because of love and worry, a mother or father who does not dare to let go of the child to stand alone, makes the child must always be helped, the child will be attached to the mother. In the end, because the child is too loved and spoiled, the child becomes unable to adjust and the development of his disposition leads to doubt. Similarly, a tough father or mother attitude can also make children lose self-confidence. However, the ideal is to still guide and supervise the child but not in a strict and rigid way. This means that children are still given the opportunity to develop themselves, take their own initiative even though they are still under the supervision and care of their parents. . The results of previous studies concluded that there is an influence of parenting on children's independence (Purwanti, R., Saleh, M., &amp; Fardhinah, Z., 2022; Suriansyah, A., &amp; Amelia, R, 2021; Wahdini, E., &amp; Suriansyah, A,2019).</p></div>
