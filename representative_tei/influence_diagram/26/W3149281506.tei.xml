<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Background: <p>Industrial estates are one of the major centers of producing energy and industrial waste in the country.One of the important points of establishing industrial units in industrial towns and areas is to pay attention to industrial ecology; rotating economic policies with industrial ecological approach should be formed in industrial towns and the limitation of vital resources should never be neglected. The industry should be used as another industry input. Given that this trend and approach does not exist in Iran, this study seeks to investigate and analyze the factors influencing the launch of the industrial ecology perspective in Iran. Developing Industrial Ecology (IE) faces significant obstacles. However, the aim of this study is to evaluate the barriers due to a combination model, including DPSIR and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). To prioritize the responses (alternatives) regards to the driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts (criteria), the hierarchy of the model are established. In this research, for the purpose of identifying and prioritizing effective factors and analyzing research results, the opinions of 44 experts in the field of waste and environment, industrial engineering and industrial process were used. Result: In the first step of the results, based on the experts' point of view and study background and the experience of the last ten years of the world's leading countries, the general framework proposed by DPSIR for IE was presented. For the comparison of two fuzzy numbers, a novel division methods using concept was used. Due to the field studies, 18 criteria and four responses are suggested. Each of the main axes of the DPSIR model was carefully analyzed and in 4 radar diagrams, the analysis of each factor was presented. The first factor (R2) Improve IE law, with Final Weight (FW) 0.251, was selected as the first priority in the IE development model in Iran. Subsequent factors, in order of final weight, included (R3) Establish IE national database (0.246), (R4) Modify industries clustering (0.249) and (R1) Industries training (0.225). Conclusion: Industrial ecology in Iran has been failed to notices so far. The results males it crystal clear that the concepts of industrial ecology have not been implemented in Iran's industrial estates. Based on the results of the analysis and the explanations provided, the proposed action plans for developing the industrial ecology model of Iran. This action provides a legal guarantee for the development of industrial ecology. Therefore, it can be said that the proposed route is the most reliable way to succeed based on current local and regional conditions in Iran.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The development of industrial ecology mostly materialized in developed countries, and after achieving suitable results, developing countries took an interest during this topic and developing its concepts in their industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Telesford, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Morales et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Naguyen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Mortensen, and Kørnøv, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Pohlmann et al., 2020)</ref>. In Iran, few plans are implemented within the field of industrial ecology, especially by specializing in industrial parks <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">(Vahidi et al., 2017)</ref>. Since the event of industrial ecology is related to more economic productivity, this state of the Iranian economy will be a really good reason for the utilization of economic opportunities created by the event of business ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bayly, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Deutz, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">, Schröder et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Simboli et al., 2020)</ref>. However, there are obstacles during this regard, which has led to the failure of some little effort made in recent years. Therefore, this research tries to check the various policies and plan the essential infrastructure of industrial ecology development in Iran supported effective indicators. A quick overview of the method of industrial ecology formation and also the most relevant studies are presented as follows. Basic ideas resulting in industrial ecology raised in Robert Ayres's works, one among the primary scientists who worked during this field. He focused on the analysis of the flow of materials and energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Schon et al., 2016)</ref>, with a greater emphasis on energy. He suggests an industrial metabolism which by ranging the operative systems, the economic will be studied as same as food and energy in a very typical ecological system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ayres, 1989)</ref>. Later, studies aimed for reducing the dependence of the economy on materials were initiated in Japan, and "industrial ecology" was used because the official title of the planning/research group <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">(Watanabe, 1972)</ref>. Years Later, in 1983, a book published by Belgians, which debate the economy of industrial ecology as a middle rather than usual monetary flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Billen et al., 1983)</ref>. Then in 1989, an enormous change occurred after Robert Frosch and Nicholas Gallopoulos' published their article with a novelty in industrial structure. Their suggestion was a replacement aspect of production processes interconnects materials flowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Frosch, 1995)</ref>. As mentioned before, one among the important challenges within the recent decade is saving energy and first resources, and reducing the spread of pollutants, to facilitate sustainable development, taking future generations considerations into consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(Tyagi et al., 2020</ref>; Khan and Kabir, 2020; Khan, 2020; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Dallas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Marques and Bassani, 2020)</ref>. Industrial ecology is one among the suggested approaches during this field. Industrial ecology will be applied to several different fields, but one among the foremost integral parts of this method may well be named as 'industrial towns' because the centers of major energy and material consumption <ref type="bibr">(Bahers et</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Gao et al., 2019)</ref> . Some studies have expressed the event of industrial ecology as a win-win-win scenario in an economicenvironmental-social trilateral relationship, and this could sure be a highlighted confirmation for the need of the presence of those concepts in industrial towns <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ho, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Tothmihaly et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Thiele, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Durán and Chichava, 2017; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Gibbs and Deutz, 2007)</ref>. One aim which may be considered for industrial ecology is to work out whether a waste material of 1 manufacturing sector may well be employed in another sector <ref type="bibr">(</ref>  Circular Economy (CE). The tactic used was supported the analysis of bibliometric within the international field. In line with bibliometric analysis, the CE evolution of CE isn't possible without the existence of concepts and tools, especially with tools like Industrial Symbiosis (IS) and ecological industrial parks (EIPs). Also, three levels of IE assistance were determined to CE, like conceptual, technical, and policy aspects. Finally, there are new CE-based research from an IE perspective with bibliometric analysis and using citation networks that include solid waste management and policies <ref type="bibr">(Saavedra et al., 2018)</ref>. Sullivan et al. conducted a study to ascertain a baseline for measure of the strategic benefits of IE principles. The analysis showed that while SMEs are mainly at the national level, they are also associated with business, through innovation, participation and strategic position. It's found that the mixing of IE, and business strategy is incredibly relevant for the three domains, but elements of all components are included in several degrees. IE, has special attention to innovation and its potential in new markets, products, and business models. Internet Explorer is additionally consciously utilized in efficient use of energy and resources, ideas that are changing to attenuate, adapt and build flexibility within the future, but also to traditional concepts of business strategy and competitive advantage. This research shows that by the mix of, IE, and strategic management theory, business organizations can play a task in creating sustainable development goals in creating positive competitive advantage <ref type="bibr">(Sullivan et al., 2018)</ref>. In Iran, the evolution of industrial Ecology began long ago; however, this development was without thought of Environmental Problems and Industrial Ecology ideas. Industrial estates are the foremost important organizations, and every one matters identifying with them are attended by Small Industries and Industrial Parks Organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Park and Gupta (2015)</ref> in a related research titled "Evaluating localism within the management of post-consumer plastic bottles in Honolulu, Hawai'i: Perspectives from industrial ecology and political ecology" assessed waste management from an environmental perspective in addition as other considerations like safety and security issues affecting urban metabolic planning. <ref type="bibr">Smith (2015)</ref> considered to investigate such issues as waste streams, the particular characteristics of waste types and conversion technologies, and also the possibility of technical savers to see the economic and environmental impacts of waste and transport and processing changes in waste management system.</p><p>At the half of the year 2005 "Iran Small Industries org" was integrated with "Iran Industrial Estate Co," and also the Iran Small Industries and Industrial Parks Organization (ISIPO) was formed which may be a developmental organization in association with the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade. The most aim designated for this organization was planning and developing industrial parks/areas (ISIPO, 2019). By the tip of 2014, a complete of 941 industrial areas were founded in Iran 754 of which are active and running, as stated within the official statistical reports of ISIPO. Establishing this, over 33000 acres of land suitable for industrial use was given to industrial units at no cost. In total, 34252 industrial units and 2429 workshops are operating in areas as mentioned earlier and have created over 700000 job opportunities, directly (ISIPO, 2019). Despite ISIOP efforts in providing the mandatory infrastructure for industrial areas, the expansion rate of those areas is above their infrastructure, which may be a worrisome issue, especially when considering environmental infrastructures. Numerous studies and studies have been conducted on the DPSIR model and consider this model as a comprehensive and integrated model for evaluation. The European Environment Agency (EEA) has used this model for integrated environmental impact assessment studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Kristensen, 2004)</ref>. Svarstad is credited with leveraging the DPSIR model as a lens so that you can act and collect, in a cycle to reach your original goal and take precautionary action <ref type="bibr">(Svarstad et al., 2008)</ref>. In this study, a DPSIR model in an exceedingly Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is conducted supported the aim of developing industrial ecology in Iran's industrial estates. Also, thanks to the experts' judgments, the priority of responses thanks to the factors, including the driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts are calculated. Finally, due to the results, the priority responses to develop the IE are discussed. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the summary of related studies to industrial ecology. </p></div>

Significantly, the opinion of some of the experienced factories owners and the industrial manager of some estates such as Alborz and Charmshahr and Salaries are also collected and used.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP)</head><p>The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a multi-criteria decision-making technique which is based on the Rational Comprehensive Theory. According to Saaty, AHP's focus is on achieving the goal that will generate a rational decision, which is the best decision among any goal that will be achieved by decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Saaty, 2008)</ref>. In other words, the main key to a rational decision is not the alternative, the criteria, or the attribute, but also it is the goal. One of the strengths of the AHP method is its flexibility in According to Saaty <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Saaty, 2008)</ref>, this AHP approach is suitable for decision making, which involves comparing decision-maker elements, and is difficult to measure quantitatively. This matter is based on the assumption that human beings' natural reaction when facing complex decision making, is by grouping the decision elements according to their common characteristics. This grouping process includes rank the decision elements and then comparing between each pair in each group in the form of a matrix. After that, inconsistency ratio and weight for each element will be acquired. Thus, it will provide ease in testing the data consistency.</p><p>The comparisons, according to the ratio-scale system, are used as input data in the AHP method to states the decision-making situation. The values in the ratio are then organized in a PCM. Preferably, the scale range 1-9 is chosen as the popular scaling system which sufficiently representing human beings' perception. However, the comparison scale used in the AHP method is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>1</label></formula><p>(2)</p><p>In the next step Consistency Ratio (CR) is calculated by using formula (3):</p><p>(3) Random Consistency Index (RI) can be used based on many references, such as Saaty's research <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Saaty, 2008)</ref>. The test of consistency result in the AHP method will be very useful. If CR ≥ 10%, the data acquired is inconsistent and If CR &lt; 10%, the data acquired is consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Saaty, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In order to utilize vague and uncertain information and data, fuzzy set theory can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Seiti et al., 2018)</ref>. Fuzzy MCDM methods are applied for modeling the vagueness and uncertainty of various systems in reality (Karagoz et al., 2020; Liu and Xiao, 2020). Van Laarhoven and Pedrycz (Van Laarhoven et al., 1983) fuzzified the AHP method for the first time. In the following, a ranking fuzzy numbers method is presented in order to enhance the efficiency and precision of the fuzzy AHP approach.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. In this research we use a new method which is described as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking fuzzy numbers method</head><p>Comparison of the two triangular fuzzy numbers, = (a, b, c) and = (d, e, f) shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>, is done by comparing their equivalent crisp numbers. The important question is how to save the characteristics of a fuzzy number while changing it into a crisp number. In the following, a novel method is presented. In this method, three possible modes are considered for a triangular fuzzy number: Second, the places of each to deal with the side ab are calculated.</p><p>and i= 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> This work is also done for side bc.</p><p>and i= 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (6</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>and i= 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (7</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>And also, and are assumed. The equivalent weight of the triangular fuzzy number of is <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> ii) Triangular with a vertical side ( , ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) Second, the places of each to deal with the side bc are calculated.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">cuts - a ) 6 ( a b i a xh i - + = cuts - a ) ( * ) 1 ( a xh a b yh i i - - = ) 6 ( b c i a xh i - + = 1 ) ( * ) 1 ( + - - - = b xh b c yh i i b xh = 11 1 11 = yh</formula><p>and i= 1, 2, 3, … 10</p><p>And also, and are assumed. Finally, the equivalent weight of the triangular fuzzy number of is <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> Using the same method described above, the weight of is also calculated as . At end, the ratio of : are considered as the ratio of two fuzzy numbers of : .</p><p>It should be mentioned that although ten were conducted in this method, but the use of more will result in higher accuracy regarding the calculation of the equivalent crisp amount of a fuzzy number.</p><p>Moreover, both vertical and horizontal characteristics of a fuzzy number should be used together.</p><p>However, the horizontal intensity must exceed the vertical. This is the main reason for the power 0.01 of when calculating the or . The power 0.01 is a result of the many trial-and-error calculations which have led to the highest accuracy.</p><p>In the following a comparative example to validate the proposed method is presented:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative example</head><p>In this comparative example, the triangular fuzzy numbers of three commonly used sets are employed for comparing the proposed ranking fuzzy numbers method with six well-known ranking fuzzy numbers Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the results. The three sets are as follows:  <ref type="table">4</ref> The results of ranking the three sets by the six mentioned methods and the suggested method.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref> shows the options listed in the form of the criteria and alternatives.  As can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, the DPSIR factors are given. Moreover, due to the AHP hierarchy, driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts are assumed as the criteria, whereas the responses are considered as the alternatives.  The weighting results and the importance of the criteria to the alternatives are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result and Discussion</head><p>This section examines the importance of each alternative to the criteria in order to evaluate the importance and prioritization of the criteria.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the importance of the following Driving Forces criteria for Responses alternatives is  on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The inconsistency ratios are checked and sure that all of them are lower than 0.1. Then, due to the ranking fuzzy numbers method, the weights of the fuzzy matrices are gained and given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impacts -Responses FAHP Evaluation</head><p>The numbers in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> shows that there are little differences between the judgments and the effects of all four responses (alternatives) are close. However, the importance of the main criteria groups are assumed equally, and the sub-criteria are also considered equal, and just the pairwise comparison of the alternatives due to each criterion are considered. Finally, the total weights are calculated and shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>. During the interviews and inspections, another important point which was observed was the lack of familiarity of workers and manager with the concepts of industrial ecology. Even with all the issues mentioned and the problems facing the development of industrial ecology, there is still considerable potential for waste flow between industrial units, but the main reason there is no such flow is the lack of information and understanding of the units about each other. Generally, industrial units in the estate work as an island and have no contact to the other units, and only some wastes such as cardboard boxes, nylon, aluminum, and plastic are collected to be recycled and are taken out of the estate. Whereas having contact between the units makes material flow possible between them. Industrial ecology brings with it the culture of recycling and reusing waste and energy and saving. The requirements for this culture are knowledge, communication, and information. The lack of these three elements and using too much energy and resources are among the major problems in Iran's industry. Considering the current economic crisis and condition in concentrating on industrial ecology plans can be a suitable approach in developing an austerity policy.</p><p>Reducing costs, saving, recycling wastes with the industrial ecology approach can make the country less dependent on importing primary resources and improve the economic status in a moderate period.</p><p>Another issue worth notice is the unsuitable location selection of industrial units based on the possibility of creating an energy and waste flow with the least distance between them. Useful studies are available on correcting the clustering of industries with the industrial ecology approach, and their experiences can be used to improve this area. For example, rectifying clustering in Australia's industrial estates <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Roberts, 2004</ref>) can be a suitable example to make corrections in this industrial estate.</p><p>If a complete series of information is collected on the units of the industrial estate and the potentials and missing areas of the flow network are identified in the estate, the management can massively help complete the flow network with attracting and establishing new industries. Not having a suitable, complete, and exact database to carry out primary industrial ecology studies is one of the obstacles facing the development of industrial ecology in this estate.</p><p>Information is the base and foundation of industrial ecology studies. The studies carried out in some estates of produced waste are general waste management studies and lack the quality and accuracy to develop and material flow model. Information such as each plants production processes, waste analysis, input material analysis, energy consumption, and location data are subjects which provide the needed information for industrial ecology studies. Developing software such as websites and online databases can help improve this situation considerably. Based on the results of the analysis and the explanations provided, the proposed action plans for developing the industrial ecology model of Iran based on the resulting priorities are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref>. and that the legislator should align with industrial ecology policies. After that, the system of industrial estate clustering needs modifications according to the IE legal and concepts. Currently, Ministry of Industries and Minerals of Iran carry out clustering with different and sometimes contradictory concepts with the industrial ecology, which in the first step, there is a need to change the perspective according to the revised rules, leads to a fundamental change in the clustering system of small and large industries in the country.</p><p>According to the studies, the absence of a comprehensive database in the field of material flow (primary and waste) and energy in all industries of the country is one of the most important obstacles to the planning and management of industrial ecology in the country. Certainly, without an intelligent IT-based database, the development of industrial ecology is not feasible. The proposed action plan is intended only to achieve the fastest possible achievements of the industrial ecology of Iran in spite of the lack of background and previous actions in this regard. Therefore, it can be said that the proposed route is the most reliable way to succeed based on current local and regional conditions in Iran.</p><note type="other">Figures Figure 1</note></div>

Central industrial ecology is answerable of fixing the linear systems of human production and consumption to closed loop systems (Mohtashami et al., 2020; Fu and Meng, 2020; Ryżyński et al., 2020; Lejarza and Baldea, 2020; Lowe and Evans, 1995). There are many advantages of using industrial ecology like environmental pollution reduction (Padash and Ataee, 2019), closed material, and energy cycle, saving money and raw materials and at last achieving practical, sustainable development (Wellmer et al., 2019; Aluchna and Rok, 2019; Padash et al., 2015; Padash, 2017; Chertow, 2008). It's important to stay in mind the interacting nature of processes and industries relationship and to not consider them as separated elements of a linear flow system. this might be used as a base for discerning ways to attach plants, industries and other waste producing processes and gather them in an interconnected web which may cause a decrease of disposed and lost material within the process (Soobhany, 2019; Onwosi et al., 2020; Vu et al., 2019). The point of interest is modified from trying to scale back facility-produced waste to abating the full waste produced by larger systems and material inflow (Stephan et al., 2020; Santagata et al., 2019; Effler et al., 2013). Some of the recent studies on IE are discussed as follows. Bahers et al., (2020) analyzed the complexity of the strength of the relationship between IE in cities and boundary regions and the nature of these social and material links. Cecchin et al., (2020) explained Industrial Symbiosis (IS) within the framework of the Economic Cycle (CE) as a new approach to sustainability and Sustainable Development (SD), which is growing rapidly. Boons (2013), presented an outline of research on how global companies accommodate their ecological impact on the speculation of ecological modernization (Jänicke, 2020; Mastrangelo and Aguiar, 2019). Schiller et al. discussed Social-Material Network Analyses studies to classify and draw on network analyses from various disciplines (Schiller et al., 2014). Cerceau et al. presented the results of a look project between 2011 and 2012 to comprise a world inventory of innovative resource management initiatives in 18 port areas of China (Cerceau et al., 2014). Reyes-Bozo et al. studied Chilean copper mining operations thanks to the green IE strategies (Reyes-Bozo et al., 2014). Leigh &amp; Li developed a conceptual framework because of environmental sustainable supply chain management, IE, and Industrial Symbiosis to embrace the combination and identify collaboratively work opportunities for companies (Leigh and Li, 2015). Corder et al. focused on identifying viable options to 'mine' metals contained in discarded urban infrastructure, manufactured products, and goods and initial estimates of the mass and current worth of metals in end-of-life products thanks to IE (Corder et al., 2015). Smith et al. considered individual wasteto-energy or waste-to-product system synergies, evaluating the economic and environmental issues thanks to the IE system (Smith et al, 2015a, 2015b). Yune reviewed the eco-industrial development within the Shanghai Chemical parcel of land and its performance within which concluded that practice within the industrial park would facilitate green development of other chemical industrial parks in China (Yune et al., 2016). Vahidi et al. conducted a study on 38 industrial units from the full active of 220 units in Qazvin, Iran, and concluded that 341.6 loads of 6 styles of wastes generated within the units are reusable result in 1.43 million dollars annual income (Vahidi et al., 2017). Hao et al., proposed a model for the expansion of green chemistry beyond the boundaries of one product, combining it with the concept of the commercial ecology in an exceedingly chemical parcel of land (Hao et al., 2017).</figDesc></figure>

In this case, driving force, pressure factors, impacts, and state regards to the pressures and driving forces are considered based on the aim of developing industrial ecology in Iran's industrial estates. Hence, by analyzing the some of the industrial estates and their current conditions such as their IE knowledge, waste generation, raw material, energy and water consumption and also their clustering system, the obstacles of IE development were investigated. Based on the background of studies in scientific research with the high cited related references in significant research, related to industrial ecology 43 factors were extracted based on DPSIR model. The extracted factors were consulted on the basis of expert opinion (based on questionnaire form). 22 factors were designated and ranked as effective factors in the industrial ecology model according to DPSIR criteria. The DPSIR factors are given in Table</figDesc></figure>

Suggested items include: 1-Implementation of industry feasibility studies in accordance with Iranian environmental laws and regulations, with emphasis on EIA and SEA; 2-Changing the definitions of the criteria for establishing industries in Iran and its tendency towards environmental and industrial ecological priorities; 3-Redefining industrial clusters with the approach of industrial ecology and renewable energies and the concepts of reuse cycles; Industrial ecology in Iran has been failed to notices so far. The results males it crystal clear that the concepts of industrial ecology have not been implemented in Iran's industrial estates. Based on the results of the hybrid model of DPSIR and FAHP model, driving forces, pressures, impacts, states factors, and responses to developing IE in industrial estates of Iran are evaluated. Due to the results, it can be concluded that if the IE development wanted to carry out efficiently, first step legal support is essential. This action provides a legal guarantee for the development of industrial ecology. The experience of countries with a proper development state of industrial ecology shows that these basic actions must be finally carried out,</figDesc><table><row><cell>Priority Responses</cell><cell>Action Plans</cell></row><row><cell>Alternatives</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
