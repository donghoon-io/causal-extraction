<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research is focused on collared and T-shirt products in the garment industry with various types of clothing, especially for the upper middle market segment. High-quality products that meet consumer needs are highly expected in today's competitive era. The results of observations of the products in this company found that there were many defects. Types of defects include dirty defects, holed, cut, and oblique defects. The method used to reduce defects is the Six Sigma method with fishbone diagram analysis, why-why analysis, and FMEA to improve product quality with the research objective of identifying the largest types of defects that occur in the production process, identifying factors that influence the biggest defects in the production process, providing suggestions for improvements using the application of six sigma with the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) stages which aims to reduce defects in the production process. The DPMO value obtained was 13619.5 for collared shirts and 15376.3 for T-shirts with a sigma level value of 3.71 for collared shirts and 3.66 for T-shirts, which is still far from what was expected. Suggestions for improving quality are making Check sheets, providing training to operators, scheduling machine maintenance, and replacing equipment with more appropriate equipment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The high volume of production demand often causes a company to ignore the quality of its products. With increasingly tight competition and high consumer demand, business actors must think more about and improve the quality of their products, starting from the initial manufacturing process until the goods are in the hands of consumers. The company is engaged in the garment industry with a variety of clothing models, especially for the upper middle market segment facilitated by automatic factory machines and supported by well-known textile suppliers with superior quality fabric quality. This company produces clothes for well-known brands. By collaborating with large companies, companies must provide the best quality products that have passed and passed the quality control process so that the quality of the products produced is always guaranteed and customers can feel satisfied.</p><p>Based on observations that have been made, in the clothing production process several types of product defects were found which were quite high, namely collared shirts at 5.4% of total production, and T-shirts at 4.6% of total production. Therefore, it is necessary to research to analyze the types of defects in the production process and the factors that cause these defects so that efforts can be made to reduce the number of defects during production. For this purpose, this research carried out an analysis of these defects with the aim of the research, namely identifying the largest types of defects that occur in the production process, identifying factors that influence the largest defects in the production process, providing suggestions for improvements that can be made to improve quality in the production process. The production process uses the application of Six Sigma with the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control) stages which aims to reduce defects in the production process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>This study aims is to reduce the total of defects, and increase the quality of the product with the Six Sigma method which uses a fishbone diagram, why-why analysis, and failure mode and effect analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Six Sigma Method</head><p>Proceedings of the 6 th Industrial <ref type="bibr">Engineering and Operations Management Bangladesh Conference Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 26-28, 2023</ref> © IEOM Society International Six Sigma is a methodology used to enhance the quality of a product. It is a widely embraced and innovative approach in the realm of quality management, serving as an alternative in quality control principles. The Six Sigma method, also known as DMAIC, is an acronym for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fishbone Diagram</head><p>The fishbone diagram, also known as the Ishikawa diagram, is a tool utilized to identify the root causes of a problem by examining its various symptoms. It is part of the seven basic tools of quality and illustrates the causeand-effect relationship of potential issues. The main problem is depicted at the head of the fishbone, with its causes branching off into sub-categories such as environment, workers, machines, and management. In the context of this research, the fishbone diagram will be employed to identify the primary causes of defects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Why-why Analysis</head><p>Why-Why analysis is a problem-solving technique that involves iteratively asking "why" to delve into the fundamental causes of an issue. While specific literature reviews on Why-Why analysis were not found, it is a commonly utilized tool in quality management and problem-solving methodologies such as Six Sigma. The process of conducting a literature review entails scrutinizing existing research to pinpoint knowledge gaps and establish a theoretical basis for one's work. Critical analysis is pivotal in comprehending research evidence, involving an assessment of its validity and relevance. Literature reviews can take various forms, each with its distinct purpose and methodology, such as narrative reviews, scoping reviews, or systematic reviews. The primary objective of a literature review is to ascertain the extent to which a body of knowledge reveals discernible trends or aggregates empirical findings related to a specific research question, thereby supporting evidence-based decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Failure Mode and Effect Analysis</head><p>Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic model utilized to identify and prevent problems within a system. It involves discussions across different divisions in a company to analyze the causes of failure for components and subsystems in a process or product. FMEA employs criteria such as occurrence, detection, and severity to determine risk priority numbers (RPN) and risk score values (RSV), which are then used to determine actions for prioritized risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>Research was carried out with the aim of identifying the types and causes of defects in products. The research process begins with field and literature studies, then identifying problems that occur and then formulating the problem. Then collect data and analyse it in the Define stage, which involves creating a project charter, SIPOC diagram, and Critical To Quality. The next step is the Measure stage, which includes calculating the P control chart, process capability, and DPMO value. After that, it is analyzed at the Analyse stage using a fishbone diagram, why-why analysis method, and failure mode and effect analysis, then recommendations for improvements related to the causes of the problems that have been identified are proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Collection</head><p>Production data and product defects used in this research are data from March 2023 to August 2023 with two clothing models, namely T-shirts and collared shirts. Based on the data obtained, for the collared shirt model, it is known that the production quantity from March 2023 to August 2023 for the collared shirt product type is 40,420 pcs with a total product defect of 2,202 pcs or 5.4% of the total production. It is known that there are 551 dirty defects, 603 holed defects, 541 cut defects, and 507 oblique defects. Meanwhile, for the T-shirt model, it is known that the number of production from March 2023 to August 2023 for the T-shirt product type is 32,344 pcs with a total product defect of 1,492 pcs or 4.6% of the total production. It is known that there are 485 dirty defects, 508 holed defects, and 499 cut defects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Discussion</head><p>On T-shirts, the defects that exist are dirty, holed and cut, while on collared shirts there are defects in dirty, holed, cut and oblique.

The total production of collared shirts was 40,420 pcs with defects of 2,202 pcs, and the total production of T-shirts was 32,344 pcs with defects of 1,492 pcs. 2.2 Opportunity Statement 6. Benefits Make efforts to reduce the number of product defects using the Six Sigma method with the hope of reducing the number of defects. This research can be useful for the company for improvements so that they can be applied to the company and it is hoped that it can reduce the number of product defects.</p><p>Proceedings of the 6 th Industrial <ref type="bibr">Engineering and Operations Management Bangladesh Conference Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 26-28, 2023</ref> © IEOM Society International Based on the control chart p above, it can be concluded that there is still data that is outside the control limits or is still not good, namely on March 17 2023, April 14 2023, May 12 2023, July 14 2023, July 21 2023. This means that the number of defects in production still needs to be there are improvements to improve the quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5. P Control Map for T-Shirt</head><p>Based on the p control chart above, it can be concluded that there is still data that is outside the control limits or is still not good, namely on May 5 2023, June 9 2023, July 14 2023. This means that the number of defects in production still needs improvement to improve quality.</p><p>Next, we obtained a calculation of the defect proportion capability, resulting in the production of collared shirts with a Cp of 1.21 and a Cpk of 0.53. Meanwhile, in the production of T-shirts, the Cp is 1.20 and the Cpk is 0.56, so both products still need improvement proposals to increase quality because they do not meet the good Cp values, namely &lt;1.33 and Cpk &lt;1. Next, the DPMO and Sigma values will be calculated. Based on the calculations that have been carried out, the DPMO value obtained for collared shirts is 13619.5 or it can be said that there are 13619.5 defects in 1,000,000 possibilities. Next, the DPMO value is converted into a sigma value, namely 3.71. For T-shirts, based on the calculations that have been carried out, the DPMO value obtained is 11532.3 or it can be said that there are 11532.3 defects in 1,000,000 possibilities. Next, the DPMO value is converted into a sigma value, namely 3.77.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Analyze Stage</head><p>After the measurement stage, the next stage is the analysis stage. At this stage, the aim is to detect problems by determining how to close the performance gap between the current system or process and the expected results. At this stage, an analysis will be carried out to explore the factors that cause defects. This is done using fishbone diagrams and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24</ref>  Proceedings of the 6 th Industrial <ref type="bibr">Engineering and Operations Management Bangladesh Conference Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 26-28, 2023</ref> © IEOM Society International</p></div>

Assessments are carried out on the level of damage (severity), possibility of occurrence, and detection. The following is a why-why analysis of collared shirt products in the table below based on discussions with the director, head of production, and production employees.
