<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Context. As the number of complex organic molecules (COMs) detected in the interstellar medium increases, it becomes even more important to place meaningful constraints on the origins and formation pathways of such chemical species. The molecular cloud Sagittarius B2(N) is host to several hot molecular cores in the early stage of star formation, where a great variety of COMs are detected in the gas phase. Given its exposure to the extreme conditions of the Galactic center (GC) region, Sgr B2(N) is one of the best targets to study the impact of environmental conditions on the production of COMs. Aims. Our main goal is to characterize the physico-chemical evolution of Sgr B2(N)'s sources in order to explain their chemical differences and constrain their environmental conditions. Methods. The chemical composition of Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores, N2, N3, N4, and N5 is derived by modeling their 3 mm emission spectra extracted from the Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA (EMoCA) imaging spectral line survey performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We derived the density distribution in the envelope of the sources based on the masses computed from the ALMA dust continuum emission maps. We used the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to compute temperature profiles and inferred the current luminosity of the sources based on the COM rotational temperatures derived from population diagrams. We used published results of 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations of high-mass star formation to estimate the time evolution of the source properties. We employed the astrochemical code MAGICKAL to compute time-dependent chemical abundances in the sources and to investigate how physical properties and environmental conditions influence the production of COMs.</p><p>Results. The analysis of the abundances of 11 COMs detected toward Sgr B2(N2-N5) reveals that N3 and N5 share a similar chemical composition while N2 differs significantly from the other sources. We estimate the current luminosities of N2, N3, N4, and N5 to be 2.6 × 10 5 L , 4.5 × 10 4 L , 3.9 × 10 5 L , and 2.8 × 10 5 L , respectively. We find that astrochemical models with a cosmic-ray ionization rate of 7 × 10 -16 s -1 best reproduce the abundances with respect to methanol of ten COMs observed toward Sgr B2(N2-N5). We also show that COMs still form efficiently on dust grains with minimum dust temperatures in the prestellar phase as high as 15 K, but that minimum temperatures higher than 25 K are excluded. Conclusions. The chemical evolution of Sgr B2(N2-N5) strongly depends on their physical history. A more realistic description of the hot cores' physical evolution requires a more rigorous treatment with RMHD simulations tailored to each hot core.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>To date more than 200 molecules 1 have been discovered in the interstellar medium (ISM) or in circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">McGuire 2018)</ref>. These molecules are mostly organic (that is they contain at least one atom of carbon) and among them about one third are composed of six or more atoms and are considered as complex in terms of astrochemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Herbst &amp; van Dishoeck 2009)</ref>. As the inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) expands, they have attracted a lot of attention, in particular recently due to their possible link to amino acids, the chemical building blocks of proteins which contribute to life as we know it on Earth. Numerous extraterrestrial amino acids have been discovered in meteorites <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Botta &amp; Bada 2002)</ref> and one in comets <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Altwegg et al. 2016)</ref>. However, the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH 2 CH 2 COOH), has not 1 See <ref type="url" target="https://cdms.astro.uni-koeln.de/classic/molecules">https://cdms.astro.uni-koeln.de/classic/molecules</ref> yet been detected in the ISM. Nonetheless, many COMs have been discovered toward the warm and dense regions associated with high-mass star formation, known as hot cores, by investigating their rotational spectrum at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. Despite these numerous detections, the precise origins of these complex species, as well as the mechanisms leading to their formation, are still subject to debate. The rise of astrochemical models solving coupled kinetic rate equations built from networks of thousands of chemical reactions has allowed significant progress in our understanding of the complex chemistry in the ISM. For instance, it has been shown that dust-grain chemical processes play an important role in the formation of COMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Garrod &amp; Herbst 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garrod et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Garrod 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Herbst &amp; van Dishoeck 2009)</ref>, the abundances of some of which cannot currently be explained by gas-phase chemistry. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the chemical processes that take place in the interstellar ices at early time and low temperature to A27, page 1 of 47 explain the later high gas-phase chemical abundances observed toward regions forming high-mass stars. The numerous COMs detected toward hot molecular cores, right after desorption from the dust grains into the gas phase, may be used to trace the physical conditions of their parent molecular cloud since they hold information on the collapse history.</p><p>The Galactic center (GC) cloud Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), located at ∼100 pc in projection from the central supermassive black hole Sgr A * , exhibits one of the richest molecular inventories observed to date and thus appears to be an excellent target to search for COMs and probe interstellar chemistry. Many of the first detections of interstellar molecules at radio and (sub)mm wavelengths were made toward Sgr B2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Menten 2004)</ref>, in particular some of the most complex species detected in the ISM, such as acetic acid CH 3 COOH <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mehringer et al. 1997)</ref>, glycolaldehyde CH 2 (OH)CHO <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hollis et al. 2000)</ref>, acetamide CH 3 C(O)NH 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hollis et al. 2006)</ref>, aminoacetonitrile NH 2 CH 2 CN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Belloche et al. 2008)</ref>, and N-methylformamide CH 3 NHCHO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Belloche et al. 2017)</ref>. With a mass of ∼10 7 M in a diameter of ∼40 pc <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lis &amp; Goldsmith 1990</ref>), Sgr B2 is also one of the most prominent regions forming high-mass stars in our Galaxy. Its two main centers of star-formation activity, Sgr B2(N)orth and Sgr B2(M)ain, both host a cluster of (ultra)compact HII regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mehringer et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gaume et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Pree et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, 2015)</ref> and several 6.7 GHz class II methanol masers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Caswell 1996)</ref>, which uniquely mark the locations of massive young protostellar objects.</p><p>Given its exceptional characteristics and its strong, ongoing star-formation activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonfand et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sánchez-Monge et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ginsburg et al. 2018)</ref>, Sgr B2 stands out from the other clouds located in the central molecular zone (CMZ; inner 200-500 pc) of the Galaxy. Indeed, recent studies find that despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to be deficient in star formation overall in comparison to other high-mass star-forming regions in the galactic disk with similar density and age (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rathborne et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kruijssen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kauffmann et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Walker et al. 2018)</ref>. This apparent inactivity suggests that the critical density for star formation in the CMZ is ∼10 7 cm -3 (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rathborne et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kruijssen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kauffmann et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ginsburg et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barnes et al. 2019)</ref>, much higher than in the rest of the galactic disk (∼10 4 cm -3 , see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lada et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lada et al. , 2012))</ref>. The environmental conditions in the CMZ are also known to be extreme compared to the rest of the galactic disk, in particular with a stronger interstellar radiation field (ISRF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lis et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Clark et al. 2013)</ref>, and higher cosmic-ray fluxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Oka et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">van der Tak et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Clark et al. 2013)</ref>. The exceptional physical conditions of the CMZ provide an excellent test of current models of high-mass star formation and can advance our understanding of star-formation mechanisms within extreme environments. Due to its proximity to the GC, Sgr B2 provides us with an interesting case study to investigate how extreme physical and environmental factors influence the high-mass star formation process, whether they tend to enhance or suppress star formation activity.</p><p>In a previous analysis of the 3 mm imaging line survey Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA (EMoCA) we reported the detection of three new hot cores, Sgr B2(N3), N4, and N5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>. These new hot cores are all associated with 6.7 GHz class II methanol masers and Sgr B2(N5) also with an ultra-compact HII (UCHII) region. From the analysis of the 3 mm emission spectra observed toward the new hot cores, we derived their chemical composition, revealing the presence of up to 23 different species of which about half are complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>. Because the spectrum observed toward the main hot core Sgr B2(N1) is close to the confusion limit and severely affected by line blending, here we focus our analysis on the four other hot cores Sgr B2(N2-N5). That all of these hot cores most probably originate from the same cloud material, with similar chemical and physical properties (e.g., initial chemical abundances, gas-to-dust mass ratio), makes comparing them with each other particularly meaningful. By comparing the predictions of astrochemical models with the observations, we want to identify the most efficient pathways leading to the formation of COMs (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Belloche et al. (2017)</ref> for the case of N-methylformamide) and explore the impact of the environment on the production of these complex species.</p><p>The extreme environmental conditions of the CMZ most likely also affect the chemistry of Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores. In particular, in dense regions shielded from direct UV irradiation, cosmic rays play an important role in the gas-phase chemistry as they represent the main source of ionization. The direct ionization of atomic and molecular hydrogen results in the formation of secondary electrons (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)), which can cause additional ionization <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Goldsmith &amp; Langer 1978)</ref>. In addition, collisions of H and H 2 with secondary electrons inside dense clouds lead to the production of ultra-violet (UV) radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Prasad &amp; Tarafdar 1983)</ref>. This cosmic ray-induced UV field can dissociate molecules, both in the gas phase and on dust-grain surfaces inside the clouds, where external UV photons cannot penetrate.</p><p>The so-called cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), ζ H 2 , describes the total rate of ionization per H 2 molecule per second, including secondary ionizations. The first theoretical determination of the CRIR was made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hayakawa et al. (1961)</ref> and revised later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Spitzer &amp; Tomasko (1968)</ref>. The latter derived a lower limit of ζ H = 6.8 × 10 -18 s -1 , which corresponds to ζ H 2 ∼ 1.3 × 10 -17 s -1 according to the simple approximation ζ H 2 ∼ 2ζ H <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Glassgold &amp; Langer 1974)</ref> commonly used for dense gas in which most hydrogen is in its molecular form. This value of ζ H 2 is often referred to as the standard CRIR. An accurate measurement of the CRIR is difficult to obtain through direct detection because low-energy particles (&lt;1 GeV) are prevented from entering the heliosphere by the solar wind, making them not directly measurable from Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Parker 1958)</ref>. However, the CRIR can be estimated with astrochemical models, by analyzing specific molecules whose formation and destruction processes are driven by cosmic rays. Given its relatively simple chemistry, the H 3 + ion is commonly used as an indirect probe for constraining the CRIR:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 2 + CR → H + 2 + e -.<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">H + 2 + H 2 → H + 3 + H.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Recently, Le <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Petit et al. (2016)</ref> used the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code to reproduce the large H 3 + column densities observed in the diffuse gas component of the line of sight to the CMZ (n = 100 cm -2 , T = 200-500 K). They derived a CRIR of ζ H 2 ∼1 -11 × 10 -14 s -1 that is in line with the values that <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Indriolo et al. (2015)</ref> obtain from an analysis of data for OH + , H 2 O + , and H 3 O + observed by Herschel for various clouds in the CMZ. However, it has been shown that low energy cosmic-ray particles can penetrate diffuse clouds easily but that they lose energy on their path toward the center of denser clouds, as they ionize and excite the matter they travel through <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Umebayashi &amp; Nakano 1981)</ref>. Many previous studies have sought to quantify the attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux in dense clouds (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Padovani et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rimmer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Neufeld &amp; Wolfire 2017)</ref>. However, despite the numerous A27, page 2 of 47 M. <ref type="bibr">Bonfand et al.:</ref> Complex chemistry in Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores attempts to constrain the CRIR in diverse regions of the ISM, huge uncertainties still remain. Therefore, the CRIR is usually treated as a free parameter in astrochemical models, ranging from ζ H<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> ∼ 10 -17 s -1 to 10 -14 s -1 . The impact of variations in the CRIR value on calculated chemical abundances can then be used to identify functional probes for the CRIR in dense clouds and determine the ionization rate that best reproduces the observations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albertsson et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allen et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we use the chemical kinetics code, MAG-ICKAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Garrod 2013)</ref>, coupled with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dullemond et al. 2012</ref>) and the published results of radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations of high-mass star formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Peters et al. 2011</ref>) to model the physico-chemical evolution of the four dense molecular cores, Sgr B2(N2-N5). We investigate the impact of physical properties and environmental conditions on the formation of specific COMs observed toward Sgr B2(N2-N5) in order to constrain the CRIR and the minimum dust temperature reached during the prestellar phase that best characterize Sgr B2(N).</p><p>The article is structured as follows: the observations and methods of analysis are presented in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we determine the physical properties of Sgr B2(N2-N5) and build up the physical models used as inputs for the chemical modeling discussed in Sect. 4. The results of our standard models are presented in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6 we discuss the impact of varying the minimum dust temperature and the CRIR on the production of COMs. We compare the model results to the observations to constrain the environmental conditions in Sgr B2(N2-N5). Finally our main results are summarized in Sect. 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The EMoCA survey</head><p>The EMoCA imaging spectral line survey was conducted with ALMA in its cycles 0 and 1 at high angular resolution (∼1.6 ) with a sensitivity of ∼3 mJy beam -1 per 488 kHz (1.7-1.3 km s -1 ) wide channel. The survey is divided into five spectral setups covering the frequency range between 84.1 and 114.4 GHz <ref type="bibr">(Table E.1)</ref>. At these frequencies, the size (half power beam width -HPBW) of the primary beam of the 12 m antennas varies between 69 at 84 GHz and 51 at 114 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Remijan 2015)</ref>. The phase center is located half way between the two main hot molecular cores Sgr B2(N1) and N2 (α J2000 = 17 h 47 m 19. s 87, δ J2000 = -28 o 22 16. 0). A detailed description of the observations, the calibration, and the imaging procedures is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Belloche et al. (2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data reduction</head><p>Belloche et al. (2016) used the spectra observed toward the main hot cores Sgr B2(N1-N2) to split the line and continuum emission into separated datacubes. In comparison, the spectra observed toward the hot cores Sgr B2(N3-N5) contain significantly less emission lines (that is more emission-free channels, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>. We used the spectra extracted toward their peak positions to split the spectral lines from the continuum emission more accurately, using the CLASS 2 software. In each spectral window of each setup, a first-order baseline is subtracted to the channels that are free of strong line emission to separate the spectral lines from the continuum. The noise level measured in the new continuum-subtracted spectra is listed in Table <ref type="table">E</ref>.1 along with the values measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Belloche et al.

Given the high densities observed in the hot cores (∼10 7 cm -3 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>, collisions in the gas phase are frequent enough for the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation to be valid. We used Weeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Maret et al. 2011)</ref>, which is part of the CLASS software, to produce LTE synthetic spectra that we compared to the observed continuum-subtracted spectra, after correction for the primary beam attenuation. Weeds solves the radiative transfer equation, taking into account the finite angular resolution of the interferometer, the line opacity, line blending, and the continuum background. The spectroscopic predictions used to model the spectra mainly originate from the CDMS (Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Endres et al. 2016)</ref> and JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pearson et al. 2010)</ref> catalog.

Each molecule is modeled separately, adjusting the following parameters: column density, rotational temperature, angular size of the emitting region (assumed to be Gaussian), velocity offset with respect to the systemic velocity of the source, and linewidth (full width at half maximum -FWHM). For each molecule, a population diagram is plotted to derive the rotational temperature and 2D Gaussians are fit to integrated intensity maps of unblended transitions to measure the size of the emitting region. 1D-Gaussian fits to emission lines are used to derive the linewidth and velocity offset. The column density is adjusted manually until a good fit to the data is obtained. Finally, the contribution from all species is added linearly to build up the complete synthetic spectrum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Protostellar evolution</head><p>In Sect. 3.3 we estimated the current luminosity of Sgr B2(N2-N5). In order to model the time-dependent chemical evolution of these sources, we need to determine the evolution of their protostellar properties, from the earlier stage of star formation, when a young protostar has just formed and started to warm up the surrounding gas. To this aim, we use published results from theoretical simulations of high-mass star formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Peters et al. (2011)</ref> report the results from the first 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations of high-mass star formation including ionization feedback. They modeled the free-fall collapse of a magnetized rotating molecular cloud containing 1000 M . The central core, with a gas density of ρ = 1.27 × 10 -20 g cm -3 within a radius of 0.5 pc, is surrounded by an envelope characterized by a density distribution ∝r -1.5 . They assumed an initial temperature of 30 K. After the first 20 kyr of simulation, many sink particles are formed, simulating a group of young stars all contributing to the radiative feedback (see their Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">1a</ref>, run E). In the initial accretion phase the first sink particle reaches a high accretion rate &gt;10 -3 M yr -1 , which reduces to ∼10 -4 M yr -1 after 0.7 Myr (see their Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">1b</ref>, run E). At the end of the simulation, the first sink particle is by far the most massive one. Although its accretion rate drops significantly when secondary sink particles form, it continues accreting material until the end of the simulation. Based on the accretion rate evolution of the most massive sink particle, without taking into account the influence of the formation of secondary particles, we approximated the relation Ṁ (t), characterizing the time-dependent evolution of the accretion rate for a young high-mass protostar. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">2a</ref> (dashed line) shows the accretion rate as a function of time for a protostar that starts accreting material from its surrounding envelope at t 0 = 0.

In order to form more massive and thus more luminous protostars, we simply assumed that the accretion rate does not drop below 10 -4 M yr -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">2a</ref>, solid line).

MAGICKAL is a single-point model that allows us to simulate in one stage the time-dependent physico-chemical evolution of a given source, from the early cold phase of the star-formation process to the warm up of the dense cores. The calculated chemical abundances characterize a range of distances from the cold extended region to the warmer innermost part of the protostellar collapsing envelope.</p><p>The chemical network is based on that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Belloche et al. (2017)</ref>. It contains 1333 distinct chemical species of which neutrals can exist either as gas-phase, grain-surface, or icemantle species, while charged species are considered in the gas phase only. The grain surface is defined as the outermost layer of ice that resides on top of the other ice layers or directly onto the grain surface itself. The rest of the ice mantle, composed of the deeper ice layers below the ice surface, is treated as a separate phase. The network comprises 13 374 chemical reactions and processes, which include gas-phase ion-molecule reactions and the related electronic recombination of the resulting protonated ions. Photodissociation and photoionization processes are also included, affecting both the gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry with UV photons from either the ambient radiation field or the CR-induced UV field. Gas-phase and ice-surface chemistry are coupled through the accretion of gas-phase material onto the grains, which may be released back into the gas phase via thermal or non-thermal desorption processes (including chemical reactive desorption, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garrod et al. 2007</ref>). Diffusion allows reactions within the mantle as well as exchange of chemical species between surface and mantle via swapping mechanisms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The chemical models</head><p>In this section we present the grid of chemical models (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>) run to investigate the time-dependent chemical evolution of Sgr B2(N2-N5) and explore the influence of environmental conditions on the calculated chemical abundances. The first parameter we vary is the minimum dust temperature, T min , that can be reached in the simulations, in particular during the cold quasi-static contraction phase prior to the onset of the free-fall collapse (see also <ref type="bibr">Sect. 3.5.1)</ref>. The minimum dust temperature adopted in the chemical simulations is critical because the production of the main ice constituents (H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , and CH 3 OH), essential to the formation of COMs, is highly sensitive to the dust temperature. At low temperatures (∼10 K), mainly hydrogenation reactions are important on the surface of dust grains. As the temperature increases, the surface diffusion rates of heavier species become more important leading to a massive increase in the surface production of simple species by addition of radicals (OH, HCO, NH, NH 2 , CH 3 , CH 2 OH, CH 3 O). However, hydrogen atoms evaporate quickly and hydrogenation reactions become less efficient because the rate of desorption of H is much faster than the rate of reaction between H atoms. In order to explore the impact of the minimum dust temperature on the production of COMs we run "low temperature" models with T min = 10 K, "intermediate temperature" models with T min = 15 K, and finally, to better represent the higher temperatures expected toward the GC, "high temperature" models with T min = 20 K (see Sect. 6.2).</p><p>The second aspect explored in the chemical simulations is the impact of the CRIR on the production of COMs. We ran chemical simulations using CRIRs ranging from the standard value ζ H 2 0 = 1.3 × 10 -17 s -1 to 1000 × ζ H 2 0 = 1.3 × 10 -14 s -1 . Given the uncertainties on the column-density dependence of the CRIR in dense regions (see Sect. 6.3), we assumed for simplicity that no attenuation occurs in the envelope of the sources. Due to its location in the CMZ, Sgr B2 is also known to be affected by X-ray emission (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Terrier et al. 2018)</ref>. As the effects of X-rays are often considered to be similar to cosmic ray-related processes (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Viti et al. 2003)</ref>, here the total ionization rate may be seen as a combination of both effects.</p><p>For each hot core we ran a grid of 18 models, one for each set of physical parameters (CRIR and T min , see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>). The interstellar radiation field is held constant throughout the model grid, assuming a standard value of 1 G 0 .

The chemical composition of Sgr B2(N2) differs significantly from that of the other hot cores. For instance, C 2 H 5 CN is about four times more abundant (with respect to CH 3 OH) in Sgr B2(N2) than toward the other hot cores; in addition, the ratio [C 2 H 5 CN]/[C 2 H 3 CN] is three times higher.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Building up ice mantles</head><p>The 1 Myr cold phase prior to the free-fall collapse allows the gas-phase chemistry to quickly convert free atoms into stable simple molecules. Meanwhile, gas-phase material is accreted onto the interstellar dust grains to form ice mantles. The rate of growth of the ice mantles is not linear as a function of time.</p><p>It is determined by the net rate of deposition of gas-phase material onto the grains and by the degree of surface coverage of bare grains. For the four standard models, N(2-5)-T15-CR1, an ice thickness of one layer is achieved at a time of 6.4 × 10 3 yr into the simulation (that is t = -0.9936 × 10 6 yr, see Fig. <ref type="figure">B</ref>.1). The rate of mantle deposition is relatively similar for models N2-T15-CR1, N4-T15-CR1, and N5-T15-CR1, over the whole quasi-static contraction phase. After 1 Myr (that is at t 0 = 0), about 110 ice layers have been formed on dust grains for the three models compared to the 161 layers formed in model N3-T15-CR1. This is due to the large densities computed at r start in the envelope of Sgr B2(N3) during the contraction phase (up to 2 × 10 6 cm -3 , see Fig.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F.4a).</head><p>The accretion of material onto the dust grains is thus more efficient in model N3-T15-CR1, leading to rapid deposition of new ice layers. For all models, the net deposition rate continues to increase until the end of the quasi-static contraction phase, indicating that the depletion of gas-phase material has not reached completion yet.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref> shows the chemical composition of the grain mantles at each ice layer based on the surface ice that gets incorporated into the mantle. A timescale is indicated such that a time associated to a given ice layer represents the time at which the ice layer was deposited onto the dust grains. The chemical composition within the first 50 ice layers of the grain mantles is similar for the four standard models. Water is clearly the dominant ice constituent for all models, while CO and CO 2 are also present in significant quantities (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>). Given the relatively high dust temperatures (T min = 15 K), the slow H-to-H 2 conversion on the grains results in high fractional abundances of atomic hydrogen in the gas phase over the whole quasi-static contraction phase (a few 10 -3 , see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>). We find that the surface reaction OH + CH 4 → H 2 O + CH 3 is the main mechanism responsible for the formation of water ice, rather than the reaction of OH with atomic or molecular hydrogen expected at lower dust temperatures (T = 10 K, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garrod &amp; Pauly 2011</ref>, see also Sect. 6.2). At the beginning of the simulations, the rapid conversion of atomic carbon to CO in the gas phase causes a sharp decline in the abundance of CH 4 ices, which in turn affects the abundance of water ice (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>). Due to the high dust temperature (T min = 15 K) the gas-phase CO accreted onto the grains is mobile enough to react with OH radicals to form CO 2 + H, limiting the fraction of OH going toward H 2 O. The abundance of solid-phase CO 2 reaches a peak within the first 10 5 yr of the simulation, representing 60-65% of the water abundance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>). Then, due to the high accretion rate of gas-phase CO onto the dust grains, a rapid switch-over occurs and CO dominates over CO 2 . H 2 CO and CH 3 OH form by the successive hydrogenation of surface CO.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> gives the chemical composition of the ice mantles at the end of the quasi-static contraction phase for the four standard models. The composition of ices observed in the line of sight of the field star Elias 16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Whittet et al. 1998</ref>) and toward the high-mass protostar W33A <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gibb et al. 2000)</ref> are also given for comparison. Models N2-T15-CR1, N4-T15-CR1, and N5-T15-CR1 build up ices with similar chemical composition, also comparable (within a factor ∼2) to that of Elias 16. The ice composition in model N3-T15-CR1 differs from that of the other models, in particular with higher abundances of H 2 CO and CH 3 OH (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). These differences are due to the higher densities computed during the contraction phase at r start in the more compact inner region of Sgr B2(N3) compared to the other sources. High densities have an impact on the accretion rate of gas-phase species onto the dust grains, such that after 1 Myr simple species start to deplete onto dust grains in N3-T15-CR1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>).</p></div>

This suggests that the gas-phase abundances observed in the warm envelopes of Sgr B2(N2-N5) are dominated by the thermal desorption of the dust-grain ice mantles. In all four models, most COMs are already present on the grains with significant abundances before the warm-up phase (T = 15 K). It is the case for the cyanides C 2 H 5 CN and CH 3 CN, as well as C 2 H 5 OH, CH 3 OH, and CH 3 SH, indicating that their production mostly relies on the early cold chemistry. Other species still form efficiently on the grains up to ∼50 K, in particular the O-bearing species CH 3 CHO, CH 3 OCHO, CH 3 OCH 3 , NH 2 CHO, and CH 3 NCO, suggesting that their production relies on the warm-up stage chemistry. The peak gas-phase fractional abundances of the ten investigated COMs are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> along with the temperatures at which they are achieved for each of the standard models.

The O-bearing species CH 3 OH, C 2 H 5 OH, NH 2 CHO, CH 3 OCHO, as well as CH 3 CN, C 2 H 5 CN, and CH 3 SH desorb from the grains at high temperatures (120-147 K).

The results reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> show that at a given radius, Sgr B2(N2) has the highest density, lying a factor ∼3 above N3 and N4 which have similar densities. The density computed for Sgr B2(N5) lies in between that of the other sources. Given the uncertainties on the calculated densities (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), the differences between the hot cores may be marginal.

We note that they used a mean molecular weight of µ = 2.33, which corresponds to that of the mean free particle, so that their calculated value has to be divided by ∼1.2 to obtain the H 2 column density. This gives N H 2 = 3.7 × 10 24 cm -2 , a factor ∼4 higher than the value we derived in this paper. The difference is due to the different assumptions made to compute the H 2 column density.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the chemical composition of the ice mantles built up during the 1-Myr cold contraction phase for the "low temperature" model N2-T10-CR1 (panel a), and the "high temperature" model N2-T20-CR1 (panel b). Significant differences can be seen in the overall chemical composition of the ice mantles compared to the standard model (that is N2-T15-CR1, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>, top panel), indicating that the minimum dust temperature adopted in the chemical simulations is of critical importance. The ice mantle formed in the low-temperature model is enriched in CO and depleted in CO 2 compared to the standard model. This is due to the less efficient CO-to-CO 2 conversion when the dust temperature drops below ∼14 K in the low-temperature model. At low temperature, H is converted more efficiently into H 2 due to its lower thermal desorption rate, thus decreasing the abundance of gas phase atomic hydrogen compared to the standard model. Surface OH mostly reacts with H 2 to form water ice rather than with CO to form CO 2 . More CO is thus available to form H 2 CO and CH 3 OH, enhancing their abundances in the outer ice layers compared to the standard model.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>).</p><p>The high-temperature model produces thinner ice mantles than N2-T10/15-CR1, with fewer than 70 ice layers formed on dust grains after 1 Myr. The ice mantles are enriched in carbon dioxide as most surface CO and OH are destroyed to form CO 2 , decreasing the amount of H 2 O, H 2 CO, and CH 3 OH formed on the grains. The atomic carbon accreted to the grains mostly reacts with surface O 2 instead of reacting with atomic hydrogen to form CH, which affects the abundance of CH 4 . Furthermore, at high temperature reactions involving atomic hydrogen are less efficient because the H coverage of the grains is reduced due to rapid desorption, cutting down the formation of complex species.</p><p>The minimum dust temperature adopted in the chemical simulations also has an impact on the abundances of complex species at later times during the free-fall collapse phase, as the investigated COMs have been shown to be mainly produced on the grain surfaces (see Sect. 5.2.2). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> compares the final gas-phase fractional abundances of the low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature models (see also ). In most cases, a higher T min results in lower fractional abundances. In particular, the O-bearing species CH 3 OH, CH 3 NCO, CH 3 CHO, CH 3 OCH 3 , and CH 3 OCHO are very sensitive to T min with, for a given source, fractional abundances lower by more than two orders of magnitude in the high-temperature models compared to the low-temperature model. The fractional abundance of CH 3 NCO varies by more than four orders of magnitude between the low-and high-temperature models for N2, N3, and N5. The fractional abundance of CH 3 SH is barely sensitive to changes in T min , with at most a factor 3.2 of difference between the low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature models for all sources. This is due to its production mechanism, which relies on gasphase H 2 CS which sticks to the dust grains at T ∼ 20 K (see Sect. 5.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2).</head><p>A more accurate representation of the dust temperatures in the envelope of Sgr B2(N2-N5), in particular in the outer parts exposed to external UV photons, requires to take into account the dust heating via the interstellar radiation field. The influence of the ISRF strength on the chemical model results is explored in Appendix D. It shows that assuming a radiation field stronger than the standard ISRF value does not improve the agreement between calculated and observed abundances with respect to CH 3 OH for Sgr B2(N2-N5) (see discussion in Sect. 6.4). Finally, a more realistic treatment of the grain-surface chemistry would require considering a grain-size distribution rather than single dust-grain radius (0.1 µm) adopted in our simulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pauly &amp; Garrod (2016)</ref> investigated the effects of a broad grain-size distribution on the ice-surface chemistry by implementing a distribution of five distinct initial grain sizes to their dark cloud models, where the radii of each grain population increase as ice mantles form on the grains. These authors found that when using a uniform dust-grain temperature across all grain sizes the surface chemistry does not significantly differ from that of models assuming a single dust-grain radius. However, for chemical models with a more explicit treatment of the grain temperatures, in which T d varies also with the grain-mantle growth of each individual grain-size population, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pauly &amp; Garrod (2016)</ref> found that the temperature difference plays a significant role in determining the total amount of ice formed and its composition for each grain-size population due to the temperature-sensitive nature of grain-surface reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Influence of the cosmic-ray ionization rate on the chemistry</head><p>In this section we explore the impact of varying ζ H 2 on the formation of COMs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">11</ref> for instance shows the composition of the ice mantles built up during the cold phase prior to the free-fall collapse for Sgr B2(N2), with ζ H 2 = 10 × ζ H 2 0 (N2-T15-CR10), 100 × ζ H 2 0 (N2-T15-CR100) and 1000 × ζ H 2 0 (N2-T15-CR1000). Panel a shows that the chemical composition of the ices exposed to a CRIR enhanced by a factor of 10 are relatively similar to that obtained for the standard model N2-T15-CR1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>, top panel). Bigger differences can be seen in the composition of the ice mantles for higher ionization rates. For instance in the models N2-T15-CR100 and N2-T15-CR1000, thicker ice mantles are formed on the grains (up to 153 ice layers for N2-T15-CR100 after 1 Myr, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">11b</ref>), than in the low-CRIR models (ζ H 2 ≤ 10 × ζ H 2 0 ). At higher ionization rates, water is still the main ice constituent, but the grain mantles are strongly depleted in CO 2 compared to the low-CRIR models, because most surface CO 2 is photodissociated via CR-induced UV photons. The abundance of CO in the ice is also diminished because gas-phase CO reacts with He + before accretion onto dust grains. Gas-phase molecular hydrogen is rapidly dissociated, leading to higher abundances of atomic hydrogen in the gas phase compared to the standard models. Surface reactions involving atomic hydrogen are thus more efficient, as seen in model N2-T15-CR100 which produces ice mantles enriched in CH 4 and NH 3 compared to the other models. NH 3 maintains a fairly stable abundance through the ice layers since the surface NH 3 photodissociated to NH 2 is quickly hydrogenated to form NH 3 again. Finally, the ice mantles in the high CRIR models (ζ H 2 ≥ 100 × ζ H 2 0 ) are significantly depleted in H 2 CO and CH 3 OH, which are efficiently destroyed by reacting with surface atomic hydrogen.</p><p>Besides their impact on the production of ice-mantle constitutents, cosmic rays also play an important role in gas-phase chemical processes, producing the ions that react with gas-phase species leading to their destruction. The results of models N2-T15, N3-T15, N4-T15, and N5-T15 with different CRIRs are plotted in Figs. B.6, B.7, B.8, and B.9, respectively. If we focus for instance on the results obtained for model N2-T15 with different CRIR, Fig. <ref type="figure">B</ref>.6 shows that higher gas-phase fractional abundances of C 2 H 5 OH and CH 3 NCO are obtained at the end of the simulation for a CRIR enhanced by a factor ten compared to the standard value. The final gas-phase fractional abundance of CH 3 CHO obtained for N2-T15-CR10 is one order of magnitude lower than that of N2-T15-CR1. This is because of reactions with atomic hydrogen destroying CH 3 CHO on the surface of dust grains. Only a small fraction of the CH 3 CHO formed on the grains thus desorbs around 60 K and contributes to its final gasphase abundance. The CH 3 CHO present in the gas phase at lower temperatures (that is before thermal desorption) mainly derives from chemical desorption, but once in the gas phase it is quickly destroyed as it reacts with ions.</p><p>At higher CRIR, in the model N2-T15-CR100, C 2 H 5 OH reaches a final gas-phase fractional abundance of about two orders of magnitude higher than in the standard model. CH 3 NCO is formed approximately three orders of magnitude more abundantly than in the standard model although it is strongly destroyed by reacting with atomic hydrogen. Its final gas-phase abundance derives from the CR-induced photodissociation of CH 3 NHCO which desorbs from the grains around T ∼ 90 K.</p><p>Finally in the model with the highest ionization rate, N2-T15-CR1000, all COMs are affected by cosmic rays (Fig. <ref type="figure">B</ref>.6, bottom panel). In particular, the abundances of COMs with little to no gas-phase formation routes decrease right after desorption from the grain surfaces, leading to low final gas-phase fractional abundances (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref>). This is the case for C 2 H 5 OH, CH 3 OH, CH 3 OCHO, CH 3 OCH 3 , NH 2 CHO, C 2 H 5 CN, and CH 3 SH, which are all destroyed in the gas phase as they react with one of the most abundant ions, H 3 O + , produced from water after it desorbs into the gas phase:      <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>.

At later times, CH 3 OCH 3 is formed in the gas phase via dissociative recombination of CH 3 OCH 4 + , a product of the ion-molecule reaction CH 3 OH 2 + + CH 3 OH, when CH 3 OH desorbs from dust grains, around 130 K. The main contribution to the final gas-phase abundance of C 2 H 3 CN and CH 3 CN also comes from gas-phase reactions. C 2 H 3 CN is mostly formed via the gas-phase reaction CN + C 2 H 4 → C 2 H 3 CN + H, when C 2 H 4 desorbs from dust grains around 70 K, and the dissociative recombination of C 2 H 6 CN + . The later reaction is particularly efficient since C 2 H 6 CN + is produced from the ionmolecule reaction H 3 O + + C 2 H 5 CN. The gas-phase abundance of C 2 H 3 CN thus increases as C 2 H 5 CN is destroyed. CH 3 CN reaches its peak gas-phase abundance at early times, around 57 K, after which it is strongly destroyed by ion-molecule reactions. The main contribution to CH 3 CN's final gas-phase abundance comes from gas-phase recombination of CH 3 CNH + , product of the ion-molecule reaction CH 3 + + HCN. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref> shows that the final gas-phase fractional abundances of the 11 investigated COMs are very sensitive to the CRIR for Sgr B2(N2-N5). For instance, the abundances of cyanides rise as the CRIR increases up to 100 × ζ H 2 0 . For higher ionization rates (ζ H 2 ≥ 500 × ζ H 2 0 ), the final gasphase abundance of C 2 H 5 CN decreases significantly, leading to [C 2 H 5 CN]/[C 2 H 3 CN] &lt; 1 in all models (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">16</ref>). The final fractional abundances calculated by models N3-T15 and N4-T15 are strongly diminished at high CRIR (1000 × ζ H 2 0 ) compared to the low ionization-rate models, except for CH 3 CHO. Model N2-T15-CR1000 shows significantly higher fractional abundances of C 2 H 5 OH, CH 3 CHO, and CH 3 NCO compared A27, page 18 of 47 to the standard model N2-T15-CR1. The impact of varying the CRIR on the calculated fractional abundances depends on the source, suggesting that the chemical differences discussed here may be exacerbated by the different physical properties of the cores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.1.">Main trends and uncertainties</head><p>The gas-phase fractional abundances obtained at T = 150 K (which corresponds to T 0 , see Sect. 3.2) for the 11 investigated COMs in all models are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">B</ref>.2. The results of all chemical models are also plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> compared to the observed abundances with respect to CH 3 OH. It shows that in most cases the chemical models tend to underestimate the observed abundances. In particular, this is the case for CH 3 OCHO, for which the calculated abundances are lower than the observed ones toward all four sources. The abundance of CH 3 NCO with respect to CH 3 OH is also underestimated by all models, by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the observed abundances. In Sect. 5.2.2 we have seen that solidphase CH 3 NCO desorbs from the grains around 70 K, however, the measured rotational temperatures toward Sgr B2(N2-N5) are higher than 140 K (Sect. E.2). This suggests that some important chemical reactions involved in the production of CH 3 NCO may be missing in the chemical network (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Quénard et al. 2018)</ref>, or that the binding energy adopted for CH 3 NCO in our chemical models (3575 K, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Belloche et al. 2017</ref>) is underestimated (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Belloche et al. 2019</ref>, for models computed with a higher binding energy). For this reason we ignored CH 3 NCO in the rest of the discussion.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> no error bars are plotted on the model results although it has been shown that calculated chemical abundances may be affected by rate coefficient uncertainties (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wakelam et al. 2005)</ref>. Given the large number of parameters in the chemical code, a full analysis taking into account both observational and theoretical uncertainties (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wakelam et al. 2006</ref>) would be too difficult and is not attempted here. Besides, additional uncertainties affecting the model results derive from the lack of experimental and theoretical data on grain-surface processes. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Iqbal et al. (2018)</ref> found that the abundances of both gas-phase and surface species calculated under typical dark cloud conditions are affected by large errors due to the uncertainties in the diffusion energy of surface species, in particular for the molecules predominantly formed at the grain surface like CH 3 OH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Enrique-Romero et al. (2016)</ref> presented quantum chemical computations showing that grainsurface radical-radical addition reactions do not necessarily lead to the formation of complex species because these radicals are trapped by the water-ice molecules with an orientation that favors other two-product reactions. This suggests that gas-phase reactions may play a more important role in the formation of COMs than currently assumed in chemical models. Recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Skouteris et al. (2018)</ref> computed rate coefficients for two gas-phase ion-molecule reactions proposed as main formation route for ceCH 3 OCH 3 : CH 3 OH + CH 3 OH 2 + → (CH 3 ) 2 OH + + H 2 O followed by the reaction of (CH 3 ) 2 OH + with NH 3 to form CH 3 OCH 3 + NH 4 + . The latter reaction, not included in our chemical network, could help in improving the agreement between the calculated and observed [CH 3 OCH 3 ]/[CH 3 OH] ratios, which differ by at least one order of magnitude in our models for N3-N5 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>).</p></div>

Panels a, b, and c show the confidence levels for all molecules, only the O-bearing molecules, and only the cyanides, respectively. The confidence level matrices differ from one source to the other, maybe reflecting the limits of our strong assumption that all sources share the same accretion history. Given that all sources should have been exposed to the same cosmic-ray flux and probably shared a similar thermal history during the prestellar phase, we focus our attention on the matrices corresponding to all sources taken together. The cyanides appear to be much more sensitive to T min and CRIR than the O-bearing species. The cyanides constrain the CRIR value to be about 50 times the standard one, and the minimum temperature to be below 20 K. The best confidence levels for the O-bearing species are also obtained for these values, but the constraints are less sharp.</p><p>Given that a model with T min = 20 K still gives acceptable results for the O-bearing species, we ran additional simulations with T min = 25 and 28 K for N2, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">ζ H 2 = 50 × ζ H 2 0 (see Fig. F.9a).</formula><p>Ignoring the cyanides, we obtained confidence levels of about 10 and 5% for the models N2-T25-CR50 and N2-T28-CR50, respectively. These values are much lower than the 23% obtained for N2-T20-CR50. This results from the high dust temperatures (T min ≥ 25 K) preventing gas-phase atoms and simple molecular species such as CO to stick to the grains, damping the formation of ice mantles and thus the production of complex species. We expect the models of N3-N5 to behave in the same way and conclude that the COM abundances relative to H 2 in N2-N5 certainly exclude T min &gt; 20 K.</p><p>We now focus on the COM chemical composition itself and show in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">15</ref> the matrices of confidence levels computed for nine COMs relative to CH 3 OH (panel a), the O-bearing molecules relative to CH 3 OH (panel b), and the cyanides relative to CH 3 CN (panel c). This refinement reveals that the O-bearing COM chemical composition relative to CH 3 OH is sensitive to the CRIR value, with the best-fit value being 50 times the standard value, in agreement with the constraints obtained from the cyanide abundances relative to H 2 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">14</ref>). A minimum temperature below 20 K seems to be favored as well. The cyanide chemical composition with respect to CH 3 CN is less sensitive to the two investigated parameters (bottom panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">15c</ref>). However, a more detailed investigation reveals that the abundance ratio of C 2 H 5 CN to C 2 H 3 CN, two species that are chemically linked (see <ref type="bibr">Sect. 5.2.2)</ref>, is sensitive to the CRIR. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">16</ref> shows that this ratio decreases as the CRIR increases in the four sources Sgr B2(N2-N5). The observed ratios are best reproduced by the models with 50</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">× ζ H 2 0 ≤ ζ H 2 ≤100 × ζ H 2 0</formula><p>, due to the increase in the gas-phase abundance of C 2 H 3 CN at late times (that is high temperatures) in these models. This behavior is consistent with what we observe, in particular toward Sgr B2(N2) where the rotational temperature derived for C 2 H 3 CN is higher than that of C 2 H 5 CN. The flat gas-phase abundance profile of C 2 H 3 CN at T &gt; 40 K in the standard models with lower CRIR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) would imply that it traces more extended regions than C 2 H 5 CN, which would be inconsistent with what is observed in Sgr B2(N2).</p><p>Our analysis above shows that the chemical models with a CRIR enhanced by a factor 50 compared to the standard value best reproduce the observations for the four hot cores taken together. However, one must keep in mind that for simplicity our models assume that cosmic rays are not attenuated in the envelope of the sources, although the large visual extinctions of Sgr B2(N2-N5) (see <ref type="bibr">Figs. F.4b and F.7b</ref>) may actually lead to attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Neufeld &amp; Wolfire (2017)</ref> showed, based on H 2 and H 3 + column densities measured toward diffuse clouds in the galactic disk, that the CRIR decreases with increasing H 2 column density with a best-fit dependence scaling as N(H 2 ) -a with a = 0.92 ± 0.32 for N(H 2 ) ∼ 10 20 -10 22 cm -2 .</p><p>A27, page 20 of 47 This implies that the cosmic-ray flux is attenuated by a factor ∼70-600 from the diffuse regions with N(H 2 ) = 10 21 cm -2 to the dense gas with N(H 2 ) = 10 23 -10 24 cm -2 . The attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux might have a significant impact on the chemical model results. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rimmer et al. (2012)</ref> showed that a column-density-dependent CRIR improves the agreement between chemical model predictions and observations for the Horsehead nebula, compared to a standard model with a constant CRIR. For a more sophisticated treatment of the cosmic-ray driven chemistry in hot core models including cosmic-ray attenuation see, <ref type="bibr">Willis et al. (in prep.)</ref>. Moreover, our models do not take into account direct cosmicray bombardment of dust-grain ice mantles although laboratory experiments showed that it can trigger a rich chemistry that may lead to the formation of more complex species even at very low temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hudson &amp; Moore 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rothard et al. 2017)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Shingledecker et al. (2018)</ref> used chemical models to investigate the effect of direct cosmic-ray collisions with dust grains on the solid-phase chemistry, including the formation of suprathermal species in the ices from collision with energetic particles. For instance, for a standard CRIR (10 -17 s -1 ), they found that the abundance of CH 3 OCHO, which is systematically underproduced in all our models (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>), is significantly enhanced in the gas phase, as well as on the grains compared to the standard chemical model (that is without cosmic-ray driven reactions).</p><p>As reported above, our models firmly exclude minimum dust temperatures of 25 K or higher during the prestellar phase of N2-N5. Such high temperatures would prevent the production of COMs at the level observed in these sources. Our models show that a value of 15 K, higher than the low values used in previous studies (≤10 K, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Müller et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Belloche et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Garrod et al. 2017)</ref>, still leads to an efficient production of COMs roughly consistent with the observations, while for 20 K signs of disagreement emerge between model and observations, especially for the cyanide abundances relative to H and the O-bearing COM chemical composition relative to CH 3 OH. A more accurate treatment of the dust temperatures in the envelope of Sgr B2(N2-N5) for different values of the ISRF does not modify the results much compared to our simple parametrization with an artificially-set minimum temperature (see <ref type="bibr">Table D.1)</ref>. A value of 15 K is close to the lowest dust temperatures measured in the GC region (19-20 K, see Sect. 6.2). It could even be that models with T min =17-18 K produce COMs in amounts that are still consistent with the abundances measured in Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores. In addition, the coldest dust grains in the GC region may be masked by warmer outer layers and thus have been missed by Herschel because of its limited angular resolution. Therefore, it is likely that the constraint we derived on T min from the COM abundances is fully consistent with the thermal properties of the GC region.</p></div>

The authors suggested that in this source, CH 3 OH traces the accretion shocks resulting from the interaction between the collapsing envelope and the accretion disk, while the cyanide emission may trace the more compact hot region radiatively heated by the protostar. In this scenario, the O-bearing COM emission detected in the envelope of G328.2551-0.5321 arises from accretion shocks rather than from the region radiatively heated by the protostar itself. If such a mechanism is at play in Sgr B2(N) at scales smaller than the beam of the EMoCA survey, then infering the luminosity of the protostars from the rotational temperature measured at the radius of the COM emission as we did in Sect. 3.3 would be wrong. The thermal history derived for Sgr B2(N2-N5) (see Sect. 3.5.2) would then be incorrect, and this could have a significant impact on the results of our chemical modeling. Observations at higher angular resolution that are attained in the ReMoCA survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Belloche et al. 2019</ref>) are needed to investigate whether a chemical differentiation between N-and O-bearing species occurs in Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores.</p><p>6.6.

(2011)</ref> leads to a final luminosity of ∼10 5 L , significantly lower than the values we derive for Sgr B2(N2-N5) (Sect. 3.3). Our simplified treatment, in which we assumed that the accretion rate does not drop below 10 -4 M yr -1 to form more massive and more luminous objects (Sect. 3.4), results in significant differences in the time evolution of Sgr B2(N3)'s physical parameters (n H , A v , and T ) compared to the other three sources. Given its lower luminosity, N3 is apparently younger than the other sources (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). In the framework of our model, this results in a faster increase of the density and temperature along the trajectory of the modeled parcel of gas during the free-fall collapse phase of N3. Figure F.9 shows that our best models (that is with ζ H 2 = 50 × ζ H 2 0 ) better reproduce the chemical abundances (with respect to H 2 ) of C 2 H 5 OH and CH 3 OH in Sgr B2(N3) compared to the other sources. However, the modeled abundances of CH 3 OCHO and CH 3 OCH 3 are 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the abundances measured toward N3. This might suggest that the relations Ṁ (t), M (t), and L (t) we derived in Sect. 3.4 do not represent accurately the physical evolution of Sgr B2(N2-N5). Furthermore, in our previous analysis of Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>, we proposed a tentative evolutionary sequence in which N4 appears younger than N3, based on the molecular outflow signature detected toward N3, while N4 does not show any evidence of outflow yet. This is in contradiction with the present analysis in which we find that N3 is the youngest of the four investigated hot cores. This is another indication that the short evolution timescale we obtain here for N3 may not represent well the physical evolution of the source. However, the origin of some wing emission seen in the spectrum of N4 is not understood (see discussion in Sect. 3.7 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonfand et al. 2017</ref>) and a search for a bipolar outflow in N4 should be carried out with more robust outflow tracers, such as CO, whose J = 1-0 transition is not covered by the EMoCA survey.</p><p>A27, page 23 of 47 A&amp;A 628, <ref type="bibr">A27 (2019)</ref> We also point out that the ages we obtain for Sgr B2(N2), N4, and N5 in Sect. 3.4 are about four times longer than the hot core lifetime we estimated in our previous analysis of Sgr B2(N)'s hot core population (∼6 × 10 4 yr, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref> on the basis of a very simple statistical argument involving the number of hot cores and UCHII regions detected in the same area and assuming a lifetime of ∼10 5 yr for the UCHII phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Peters et al. 2010)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>We analyzed the results of the 3 mm imaging line survey EMoCA conducted with ALMA in its cycles 0 and 1 to characterize the hot core population embedded in Sgr B2(N). We derived the chemical composition of the three hot cores Sgr B2(N3-N5) focusing on 11 COMs. We investigated the timedependent evolution of the protostellar properties and we derived the evolution of density, temperature, and visual extinction in the envelopes of Sgr B2(N2-N5). We used the astrochemical code MAGICKAL to simulate the time-dependent chemical evolution of the sources based on their physical evolution. We investigated the impact of the cosmic rays and the minimum dust temperature reached during the cold prestellar phase on the chemical abundances calculated by the models. We compared the results to the observations to constrain the physical parameters which best represent the environmental conditions characterizing Sgr B2(N) and the GC region. Our main results are the following:</p><p>1. Sgr B2(N3) and N5 share a similar chemical composition relative to methanol. The chemical composition of Sgr B2(N2) differs significantly from the other hot cores Sgr B2(N3-N5). 2. We derived gas densities of 1.4 × 10 7 cm -3 toward Sgr B2(N2) at a radius of 6010 au (∼0.03pc), while the values derived for N3, N4, and N5 at the same radius are a factor 3.2, 3.5, and 2.0 lower, respectively. 3. On the basis of the rotational temperature derived for the COMs and using the results of RMHD simulations of highmass star formation, the current luminosities of the hot cores are estimated to be 2.6 × 10 5 L , 4.5 × 10 4 L , 3.9 × 10 5 L , 2.8 × 10 5 L for Sgr B2(N2), N3, N4, and N5, respectively. These results hold only if our assumption that the COM emission arises from the region radiatively heated by the protostar is valid. 4. The production of the cyanides C 2 H 5 CN and CH 3 CN as well as CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH mostly relies on the early cold grain-surface chemistry (T d 15 K), while the O-bearing species CH 3 CHO, CH 3 OCHO, CH 3 OCH 3 are predominantly formed during the warm-up phase of the protostellar evolution. 5. COMs form efficiently on grains during the prestellar phase of Sgr B2(N2-N5) with minimum dust temperatures as high as 15 K. Minimum dust temperatures 25 K are firmly excluded by our chemical models. 6. The cosmic-ray ionization rate adopted in the chemical simulations is critical, in particular during the warm-up stage where cosmic rays may rapidly destroy COMs once they are released into the gas phase. The best match between chemical models and observations is obtained for ζ H 2 = 7 × 10 -16 s -1 , that is a CRIR enhanced by a factor 50 compared to the solar neighborhood value. This is somewhat lower than extreme values expected toward the diffuse medium in the GC region (1 -11 × 10 -14 s -1 ). This difference may reflect the attenuation of cosmic rays in denser gas. The chemical composition calculated by our models for Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores strongly depends on their history since the initial stages in the prestellar phase. Our strong assumption about the accretion history being the same for all sources implies a much shorter timescale for Sgr B2(N3) which has a significant impact on its calculated chemical composition and results in a worse agreement with the observations. Furthermore, our model in which the three other hot cores, N2, N4, and N5 are by far older than N3 is inconsistent with the tentative evolutionary sequence suggested in our previous analysis of Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores based on their association with class II methanol masers, outflows, and UCHII regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>. This emphasizes the need for RMHD simulations tailored to each hot core in order to have a more realistic description of their history and improve the reliability of the chemical model results.   (a) Because NH 2 CHO is not detected toward N4 and we estimated only an upper limit to its molecular column density, a level of confidence of unity is attributed if the calculated ratio [NH 2 CHO]/[H 2 ] is lower than the upper limit, otherwise it is treated normally.</p><p>In order to determine which set of physical parameters (T min and CRIR) best characterizes Sgr B2(N)'s hot cores (see Sect. 6.4.2), we evaluate the success of each model in reproducing the observations using the method presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garrod et al. (2007)</ref>. For each model, we compute a level of confidence, κ i , in the agreement between calculated and observed abundances (relative to H 2 , CH 3 OH, or CH 3 CN). For each calculated abundance ratio, the level of confidence is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">κ i = erfc | log(R model,i ) -log(R obs,i ) | √ 2σ , (C.1)</formula><p>which computes the logarithmic distance of disagreement between the calculated abundance ratio (R model,i ) and the observed one (R obs,i ). We define the standard deviation σ = 1 such that one standard deviation corresponds to one order of magnitude lower/higher than the observed abundance ratio. erfc is the complementary error function (erfc = 1-erf) such that κ i ranges between 0 and 1. For instance, a calculated abundance ratio lying one order of magnitude lower/higher than the observed one has a confidence level κ i = 31.7% (and κ i = 4.6% for two orders of magnitude etc.). For each model we take the mean of the confidence levels obtained for the molecules in the sample to define the overall confidence level of the model with respect to the observations. The results are given in Tables C.1-C.6.  (a) Because NH 2 CHO is not detected toward N4 and we estimated only an upper limit to its molecular column density, a level of confidence of unity is attributed if the calculated ratio [NH 2 CHO]/[H 2 ] is lower than the upper limit, otherwise it is treated normally.  Notes. Same as C.1 but for the abundances of nine COMs relative to CH 3 OH. (a) Because NH 2 CHO is not detected toward N4 and we estimated only an upper limit to its molecular column density, a level of confidence of unity is attributed if the calculated ratio [NH 2 CHO]/[CH 3 OH] is lower than the upper limit, otherwise it is treated normally.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D: Influence of the external radiation field on the chemistry</head><p>Investigations carried out on the extreme environmental conditions characterizing the GC region suggest that the ambient radiation field may be enhanced by a factor ∼500-1000 in the inner Galaxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lis et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Clark et al. 2013</ref>), compared to the standard ISRF value (1 G 0 ) used in our simulations. A stronger ISRF may not have a big impact on the warm chemistry during the free-fall collapse phase, because external UV photons are rapidly absorbed as the visual extinction increases. However, it may be more critical during the preceding low-density phase, where dust grains are not efficiently shielded against external radiation. Recently, Hocuk (2017) derived a parametric expression of the dust temperature scalable with the interstellar radiation field strength. Based on their analysis we scale the dust temperature expression of Garrod &amp; Pauly (2011) (see Sect. 3.5.1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">T UV d (A v ) = T d (A v ) χ 1/5.9</formula><p>UV , where χ UV represents the strength of the UV field in units of the standard Draine field. In order to explore the impact of a stronger radiation field on the production of COMs, we run three additional chemical models, N2-UV100, N2-UV500, and N2-UV1000, with χ UV = 100 G 0 , 500 G 0 , and 1000 G 0 , respectively. No minimum threshold is fixed for the dust temperatures, which go as low as ∼14, 17, and 19 K in models N2-UV100, N2-UV500, and N2-UV1000, respectively. The gas temperature, T g , is held constant at 15 K during the whole quasi-static contraction phase. We adopt ζ H 2 = 6.5 × 10 -16 s -1 as found to be the CRIR that best reproduces the observations toward Sgr B2(N2-N5) (see Sect. 6.4.2). Figure D.1 compares the calculated gas-phase fractional abundances of ten COMs relative to CH 3 OH for the models with strong UV fields to the observed abundances. The results of model N2-CR50-UV1, with a standard radiation field and a minimum dust temperature T min = 15 K, are also shown for comparison. It shows that stronger UV fields increase the discrepancy between the calculated and observed abundances of cyanides with respect to CH 3 OH, while the abundances of NH 2 CHO, CH 3 CHO, and C 2 H 5 OH relative to CH 3 OH are only slightly affected by the UV field strength.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">D</ref>.1 gives the mean confidence level of the models with the observations for different χ UV . It shows that the highest confidence level for the abundances of nine COMs (excluding CH 3 NCO) with respect to CH 3 OH is obtained with the model assuming a standard ISRF (1 G 0 ). The confidence levels drop significantly for models with higher χ UV . The opposite behavior is obtained when computing confidence levels with only the cyanides C 2 H 3 CN and C 2 H 5 CN with respect to CH 3 CN (that is the agreement with observations increases with the UV field strength). Finally, all models have similar confidence levels when computed based only on the O-bearing species CH 3 OCHO, CH 3 OCH 3 , CH 3 CHO, C 2 H 5 OH, and NH 2 CHO. This does not allow us to conclude strictly on which interstellar radiation field better characterizes Sgr B2(N). This is consistent with the results we obtain by simply parametrizing the dust temperature profile with an artificially-set minimum temperature (see <ref type="bibr">Sect. 6.4.2)</ref>.</p><p>As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hocuk (2017)</ref>, the dust temperature expression of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garrod &amp; Pauly (2011)</ref> results in higher temperatures at low visual extinctions than the values computed using the  parametric expression of Hocuk (2017; see their Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). For comparison, we plot in Fig. <ref type="figure">D</ref>.1 the fractional abundances with respect to CH 3 OH calculated by model N2-CR50-Tdhoc-UV100, which uses the dust temperature expression given by Hocuk (2017; see their Eq.

Figure <ref type="figure">D</ref>.1 shows that the expression used to compute the dust temperature does not have a strong impact on the production of COMs, as there is at most a factor ∼1.6 of difference in the abundances with respect to CH 3 OH calculated by models N2-CR50-Tdhoc-UV100 and N2-CR50-UV100.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A: Uncertainties on the molecular column densities</head><p>The column densities estimated in Sect. 5.1 for Sgr B2(N3-N5) (see also <ref type="bibr">Table. E.2)</ref> are based on simple assumptions, such as a single excitation temperature to characterize all transitions from a given molecule under the LTE approximation. In addition, because the hot core emission toward Sgr B2(N3-N5) is resolved in our data for only a few species, especially toward Sgr B2(N3) for which transitions from only two species could be used to derive the source size <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonfand et al. 2017)</ref>, we assume for each of these three sources that all molecules are emitted from the same region characterized by a single size. This may not be true as it is shown in Sect. 5.2.2 that all investigated COMs do not desorb from the dust grains at the same temperature in the chemical models, suggesting that they may trace different regions.</p><p>In order to estimate the uncertainties on the column densities we varied for each species detected toward Sgr B2(N3-N5) the emission size and rotational temperature within the uncertainties given by the 2D Gaussian fits to the integrated intensity maps and population diagrams, respectively. Comparing the column densities derived with our best-fit synthetic spectra <ref type="bibr">(Table E.2)</ref> with those obtained varying temperature and source size, we find that column densities vary at most by a factor four.
