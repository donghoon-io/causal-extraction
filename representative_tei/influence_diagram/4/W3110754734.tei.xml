<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>A significant share of the available societal resources is spent annually to develop new public infrastructure and to manage the existing one. For instance, European countries employed on average 3.3%-4.2% of their GDP in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) during 2009-2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Athenosy et al. 2017)</ref>, the USA spent 2.4% of GDP in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Shirley, Chad 2017)</ref>, and Canada spent 7.4% of <ref type="bibr">GDP during 1956</ref><ref type="bibr">-1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kalaitzidakisa and Kalyvitisb 2005)</ref>. The investment in operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) constitutes a large part of this expenditure. By way of example, Canada employed on average 21% of the GFCF in <ref type="bibr">O&amp;M during 1956</ref><ref type="bibr">-1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kalaitzidakisa and Kalyvitisb 2005)</ref>, while the USA spent on average 49% during <ref type="bibr">1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">-2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rioja 2013))</ref>. The built environment is reaching a state of maturity in developed countries and the cost associated with the integrity management of existing infrastructure is increasing its share of the total expenditure in public infrastructure. As a reference, it is estimated by using the database from the US Department of Transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(FHWA 2020)</ref> that the ratio between the number of highway bridges subject to major repair or reconstruction to newly constructed ones increased from 7% during the 1950s, to 13% during the 1970s and to 24% during the 2000s.</p><p>For a particular structure, the main phases of its life-cycle are (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) (i) planning and design, (ii) construction/installation, (iii) commissioning, (iv) O&amp;M, and (v) decommissioning.</p><p>Integrity management, including the planning of inspections and maintenance (I&amp;M), is a crucial part of the life-cycle optimization of structures. Optimal I&amp;M planning for a structural system depends on many aspects specified during the design phase: number and configuration of structural components, accessibility of hot-spots, correlation of the material resistance among components, importance of components relative to system reliability, redundancy and robustness. Correspondingly, the consideration of possible integrity management measures in structural design decisions likely results in a more optimal use of resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(ISO 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McAuliffe et al. 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life-cycle risk management for fatigue deteriorating structures</head><p>Decisions made for the integrity management of structures depend on the estimation of their structural reliability. The reliability of a structural system changes with time. Deterioration processes, such as corrosion or fatigue, may reduce the structural resistance during the operational life of the structure. Moreover, the stochastic environmental loading may not be a stationary process.</p><p>The estimation of structural reliability is conditional on the available knowledge. Consequently, information acquisition techniques that reduce uncertainty, such as inspections and structural health monitoring, have a strong influence on the estimation of structural reliability and correspondingly on integrity management decisions.</p><p>This study focuses on fatigue deterioration. The current practice for fatigue assessment is established in several standards and recommended design guidelines, e.g. <ref type="bibr">NORSOK 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">HSE 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">CEN 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">ISO 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">API 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hobbacher 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">DNV-GL 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">BSI 2015</ref>. An overview of the fatigue assessment approaches and safety factors employed in some of these standards can be found in HSE <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref>. In general, these codes provide prescriptive rules for fatigue design based on a semi-probabilistic safety format. Often, different safety factors are given depending on the consequences of failure. For instance, three different consequence classes are distinguished by the International Institute of Welding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hobbacher 2016</ref>): (1) loss of secondary structural parts, (2) loss of entire structure and (3) loss of human life.</p><p>Risk of failure can be managed throughout the different phases of a structure's life-cycle. The definition of risk and the information that is required for its computation may differ depending on the type of decision that is assessed. For instance, the assessment of the risk of fatigue failure at the design phase is in general assessed using semi-empirical SN-curves (DNV-GL 2016), whereas the fracture mechanics approach is preferred during O&amp;M <ref type="bibr">(Almar-Naess 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">DNV-GL 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The latter is due to the need of relating fatigue deterioration to physical parameters, such as crack depth, that are directly observable and can consequently be updated based upon structural health information. To represent the sequential decision problem that includes design as well as I&amp;M decisions, coherent probabilistic models of the relevant phenomena should be chosen.</p><p>Fatigue design of steel structures is addressed in part 1-9 of the Eurocode 3 <ref type="bibr">(CEN 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The code accepts two different design approaches: (1) safe-life and (2) damage tolerant. Partial safety factors are provided for two levels of inspectability or accessibility to the structural detail: accessible joint detail and poor accessibility.</p><p>(1) The safe-life method dispenses with regular inspections by requiring a sufficiently large reliability level. This is achieved by reducing the probability of a crack growing to a critical crack dimension below a codified threshold during the service life of the structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gurney 1979)</ref>.</p><p>(2) For the damage tolerant method, also called the fail-safe approach, structures are designed such that cracks are expected to develop at certain hot-spots. It was developed by the aircraft industry for the purpose of reducing the amount of employed structural material and therefore, reducing the weight of the aircrafts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lincoln 1985)</ref>. Consequently, regular inspections are required in order to maintain the structure within a reasonable safety-level during its service life.</p><p>The damage tolerant approach opens the possibility of finding a cost-optimum balance between the investments in maintenance and design. Nevertheless, the required level of safety at design in Eurocode 3 is prescribed independently from an inspection and maintenance program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated structural design and life-cycle integrity management</head><p>Extensive literature exists on the development and application of risk-based methodologies for the different phases of a structure's life-cycle. A comprehensive overview is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moan (2018)</ref> for offshore structures. However, there are not many studies conducted on quantitative design methodologies that address the combined impact and efficiency of mitigation measures performed at different points in time of the life-cycle of a structure. These methods are referred to as integrated structural design methods in this paper. A review of literature in this field is presented in the following.</p><p>The usefulness of integrating I&amp;M information at the design phase is emphasized in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Straub et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moan 2018)</ref>. A model to quantify the effect of fatigue design on inspection planning at the component level is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Madsen and Sorensen (1990)</ref>. The framework is applied to the optimization of the thickness, inspection times and inspection quality of a jacket 4</p><p>Mendoza, July 27, 2020 joint. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cramer and Friis-Hansen (1994)</ref> use this model to address optimal design, fabrication and inspection length for welded components with several hot-spots. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moan et al. (1993)</ref> proposes a relaxation of the design Palmgren-Miner's sum as a function of the inspection program. Generic reliability-and risk-based inspection planning methods have been developed in terms of commonly used deterministic design parameters, such as the fatigue design factor FDF defined in this paper in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Faber et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Straub 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Faber et al. 2005)</ref>. Some system effects were neglected in these studies, such as the updating of a component due to the inspection outcome of nearby components; although other system considerations were included, such as the importance of a component with regard to the integrity of the system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Straub et al. (2006)</ref> shows the benefits of riskbased inspection (RBI) planning for offshore structures and discusses the possibility of optimising inspection planning and the FDF by including the associated construction costs. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sørensen (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Márquez-Domínguez and Sørensen (2012)</ref>, a framework for reliability-based FDF calibration for offshore wind turbines is developed. Another application of this framework exists for RBI planning of a 20 MW offshore wind turbine jacket <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gintautas et al. 2018)</ref>. A component based optimization of the FDF and maintenance strategy is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zou et al. (2018)</ref>. A risk-based framework for conceptual design of ships is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Garbatov et al. (2018)</ref>, where an ultimate limit state is considered in combination with deterioration due to corrosion.</p><p>In summary, models to quantify the effect of design on life-cycle risk and on optimal I&amp;M planning exist in the literature. Furthermore, reliability requirements for I&amp;M given design specifications are provided in studies and design standards. Models to simultaneously assess optimal integrated design and I&amp;M strategies began to be developed in the 90s for the component level.</p><p>Little follow-up of these studies is documented in the literature afterwards, although new studies from the offshore wind sector have been published in recent years. The authors are not aware of studies on optimal integrated fatigue design and I&amp;M planning methods at the system level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the paper</head><p>The objective of this paper is to present a risk-based integrated structural design framework in which I&amp;M planning of deteriorating details is explicitly considered. The framework considers Mendoza, July 27, 2020 system effects such as the effect of correlation among hot-spot deterioration, the level of redundancy and the impact of information gathered at the component level on system reliability. The proposed framework is elaborated in the following section. Afterwards, the methodology is implemented to study the optimal life-cycle fatigue design of the joints of a lattice structure. Advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology are explored, together with some potential applications of the framework and further research. The paper concludes with a summary of the main findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL DESIGN FRAMEWORK</head><p>The proposed framework aims to optimise the allocation of mitigation measures during the life-cycle of deteriorating structural systems prior to their construction. Two mitigation measures are considered. Namely, to increase the safety level at the design phase and to conduct I&amp;M actions. The framework explicitly addresses system effects. This is computationally demanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Luque and Straub 2016)</ref>. Consequently, an efficient system representation needs to be used. The proposed framework is kept general in this section, but a hierarchical influence diagram (ID) based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Luque and Straub (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bismut and Straub (2018)</ref> is employed for the numerical example in the following section. The computational demand of the numerical example is reported in the discussion section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generic representation</head><p>The proposed framework is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. An integrated design is here defined as the combination of a design specification D j ∈ D together with an I&amp;M strategy S i ∈ S. A design consists of a set of specifications that are sufficient to assess the safety level of the structural system for given failure mechanisms. An I&amp;M strategy specifies when and where to inspect as well as the repair and maintenance criteria. The optimal integrated design {D opt , S opt } is defined as the one that minimizes the expected total life-cycle cost.</p><p>In their most complete definition, D and S would contain all possible design descriptions and I&amp;M strategies. Nevertheless, this is unpractical and therefore, smart choices should be made upfront to explore a reduced, yet still representative, space of alternatives. For instance, D could contain a discrete set of fatigue safety factor values. S could contain decision rules, such as 6 Mendoza, July 27, 2020 repair any detected damage, and a reduced set of alternatives, such as a set of time intervals between preventive inspections <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bismut and Straub 2020)</ref>. Optimal I&amp;M planning given a design specification depends on available information and therefore, it can and should be reassessed for the as-built structure and every time new information becomes available <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Madsen and Sorensen 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moan 2018)</ref>. This is to be considered in the selection of the appropriate level of detail used to represent potential I&amp;M strategies.</p><p>The system representation includes:</p><p>• A deterioration model that allows for the representation of the influence on the deterioration process of design decisions and maintenance actions.</p><p>• A model for the statistical dependence of the deterioration among components, since this affects the estimation of the reliability of the system and the efficiency of the inspection campaigns.</p><p>• A likelihood model connecting the observations from the inspection techniques with the state of deterioration.</p><p>• A model that relates component condition to system reliability.</p><p>• A model for the costs of the different decision alternatives and consequences of the considered outcomes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective function</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">A set of N d designs D = {D 1 , D 2 , ..., D N d }</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">(D j , S i )]}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where E[•] is the expectation operator.</p><p>The expected life-cycle cost E[C T (D j , S i )] is defined as the sum of the design cost C D (D j ), which includes costs associated with the design and construction of the structural components, and the expected inspection, maintenance and failure (IMF) cost E[C I M F (D j , S i )]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E[C T (D j , S i )] = C D (D j ) + E[C I M F (D j , S i )]<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The expected IMF cost E[C I M F (D j , S i )] is computed as the sum of the expected costs associated with starting an inspection campaign C C , conducting inspections C I , repairs C R and failure C F :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E[C I M F (D j , S i )] = E[C C (D j , S i )] + E[C I (D j , S i )] + E[C R (D j , S i )] + E[C F (D j , S i )]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>These costs are discounted to their present value by a function γ(t) as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bismut and Straub 2020)</ref>. In particular, the expected failure cost, also called risk of failure R F , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R F (D j , S i ) = E Z E Θ [C F (D j , S i |Z)] = E Z T SL t=1 C F • γ(t) • Pr(F sys,yr,t |Z 0:t-1 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where C F is the cost of failure and Pr(F sys,yr,t |Z 0:t-1 ) is the annual probability of failure during year t -1 to t, conditional on available information up to time t -1, denoted Z 0:t-1 . The expectation over the cost of failure is computed over possible states of the system Θ ∈ Ω Θ and inspection outcomes Z ∈ Ω Z . This double expectation is computationally expensive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Luque and Straub (2019)</ref> propose to first compute the expected cost of failure conditional on the inspection outcomes and afterwards integrate over the sampled observation histories by crude Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). A relatively low number of samples is needed since the conditional probability of failure is computed for each sampled observation history. They estimate that around n sim = 200 simulations suffice for most practical applications, although this depends on the variance of the expected cost of failure conditional on the observation histories, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Var Z [E Θ [C F (D j , S i |Z)]].</formula><p>The accuracy of the estimation is explored below for the numerical application.</p><p>The minimisation of the expected life-cycle cost in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>) can be divided into two steps, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. First, an optimal strategy S opt,j can be found given a certain design specification D j through the minimization of the expected IMF cost:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S opt,j = S opt |D j = arg min i=1,...,N s {E[C I M F (S i , D j )]}<label>(5)</label></formula><p>For N d considered designs, the set of optimal strategies is collected into the vector Ŝopt = { Ŝopt,1 , Ŝopt,2 , ..., Ŝopt,N d }. The optimal integrated design D opt ∈ D and S opt ∈ Ŝopt is then computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">{D opt , S opt } = arg min j=1,...,N d {E[C T (D j , Ŝopt,j )]}<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE STUDY</head><p>The application of the proposed framework is illustrated with a case study. The fatigue design of the joints of the offshore lattice structure in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> is considered. The structure is a redundant frame constituted of six tubular members (B1-B6) and a semi-rigid top horizontal I-beam. All joints among members are welded. The frame structure has ten locations or hot-spots (HS1-HS10)</p><p>where fatigue cracks may occur under cyclic loading. Hot-spots above the highest astronomical tide (HAT), i.e. HS1-HS4, are denoted dry hot-spots and can be inspected. Hot-spots HS5-HS10 are denoted submerged hot-spots and are assumed to be non-accessible, i.e. they cannot be inspected.</p><p>The frame is subject to an extreme environmental load with annual maximum Q and cyclic wave loading L(t). The system is a simple structure that allows investigating the effect of:</p><p>(1) the correlation among component deterioration;</p><p>(2) the structural importance of the components;</p><p>(3) the inspectability of structural details.</p><p>The objective of the decision problem is to compute the optimal integrated fatigue design of the structure {D opt , S opt }. An inspection strategy S j is characterized by the time between inspection campaigns ∆t I . A fatigue design D j is characterised by the specification of the fatigue design factor FDF of the hot-spots. The FDF of a hot-spot i is defined as the ratio between its deterministic fatigue life T F L,i and the design service life of the structure T SL = 20 years:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">FDF i = T F L,i T SL (7)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchical influence diagram</head><p>A hierarchical ID is used to assess the influence of the decision parameters, i.e. the FDF of the hot-spots and the inspection interval ∆t I , on the probabilistic fatigue deterioration process and consequently, on the structural reliability of the system. The employed ID is an extension of the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Luque and Straub (2019)</ref>. First, the deterioration model is presented. Second, the relationship between the deterioration model and the system condition is elaborated. Lastly, the likelihood models used for inference of inspection outcomes are described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fatigue deterioration model</head><p>The structure is subject to a wave-induced cyclic load ∆L(t) that leads to fatigue stresses in its hot-spots i = 1, 2, ..., 10, with long-term distribution ∆S i represented by a Weibull distribution with scale parameter k ∆S,i and shape parameter λ i . As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Madsen (1997)</ref>, the effect of the fatigue stresses on fatigue crack growth can then be captured by the equivalent stress range ∆S e,i , which is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆S e,i (FDF i ) = E ∆S [∆S m i i ] (1/m i ) = k ∆S,i (FDF i ) • Γ 1 + m i λ i (1/m i )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where Γ(•) is the gamma function and m i is a material parameter of the deterioration model, which is modelled according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ditlevsen and Madsen 1996)</ref>. The distributions and values used to represent these parameters are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. Note that k ∆S,i depends on the fatigue design factor of the hot-spot FDF i . This relationship is explored further below and shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>.</p><p>Hot-spots are assumed to contain initial defects, which are represented by an exponential distribution with mean crack length equal to 1 mm. Given this initial crack length, crack growth can then be modelled by a linear elastic fracture mechanics model (LEFM), see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lassen (1997)</ref>.</p><p>The stochastic LEFM-based model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Madsen et al. (1987)</ref> is used to represent the crack 10 Mendoza, July 27, 2020 growth model. The crack length at a hot-spot i at time step t is denoted a i,t and given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a i,t = (1 -m i /2)C i,t ∆S m i e,i π m i /2 ν + a (1-m i /2) i,t-1 (1-m i /2) -1 (9)</formula><p>where ν is the number of stress cycles per time step, a i,t-1 is the crack length at the previous time step and C i is a material parameter. It is assumed that C i is fully correlated with m i by the linear model ln C i = -1.567m i -27.517 proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bismut and Straub (2020)</ref>. The employed values of the basic variables of the fatigue deterioration model are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. Note that ν is taken as 10 5 cycles/year according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Straub (2009)</ref>.</p><p>The structural reliability of the components is assessed according to the fatigue limit state g F M :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">g F M = a cr -a i,t<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where g F M ≤ 0 represents the event of failure, which happens when the crack length is larger than the critical crack length a cr = 10 mm. It is noted that the LEFM-based estimate of fatigue life is rather insensitive to the value of a cr , due to the exponential nature of the model.</p><p>The fatigue deterioration process is modelled as a Markov process using the dynamic Bayesian Network (BN) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Straub (2009)</ref>. This is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, where circular nodes represent random variables, rectangle nodes are decision parameters and the arches represent dependencies, directed from cause to effect. At a given time step t (0 ≤ t ≤ T SL ), the crack length of a given hot-spot a i,t is specified conditional on the crack depth at the previous time step a i,t-1 , and the stochastic crack growth parameters, i.e. the material parameters m i and C i , and the scale parameter k ∆S,i of the Weibull distributed fatigue stress range. Furthermore, if an inspection is conducted (I i,t = yes), the inspection outcome z i,t is available.

Inspections of all dry hot-spots every two, five and ten years are considered, plus the case in which no inspections are performed.</p><p>Furthermore, a decision rule is applied: any detected damage is assumed to be repaired and thereby restored to the initial condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of correlation</head><p>An important benefit of considering system effects is that the dependency among hot-spots' deterioration is explicitly taken into account. Consequently, information obtained by inspecting a certain hot-spot is used to update the belief on the deterioration state at other correlated hot-spots.</p><p>The effect of correlation among the deterioration processes at different hot-spots can be observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref>. The time evolution of the cumulative probability of failure of hot-spots HS1 and HS5 is plotted. In this example, HS1 is inspected every five years without detecting any crack. HS5, which belongs to B4 and is located underwater, cannot be inspected. These results are given for Design 3, with FDF d = FDF s = 6. Therefore, the prior probability of failure is equal for both hot-spots.</p><p>It can be seen that inspecting HS1 and not finding a crack decreases the estimated probability of system failure of HS5 through the statistical dependence among the fatigue processes. 20 Mendoza, July 27, 2020</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of FDF on the probability of system failure</head><p>The time evolution of the posterior annual probability of failure of the system is compared for the three considered designs in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">12</ref>. ∆t I is set to five years, which means that three inspections are carried out at years 5, 10 and 15. Note that at year t, the annual probability of system failure Pr(F sys,yr ) is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation over the observation outcomes up to that time.</p><p>It can be observed that the FDF has a significant impact on the time-variant system reliability, which is strongly affected by the speed of the hot-spot deterioration, i.e. the growth rate da(t)/dn(t), which is proportional to the fatigue stress range to the m-th power and consequently inversely proportional to the FDF. Thus, doubling the FDF decreases the crack growth rate by about 50%.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the system, it is not possible to establish a simple relationship between ∆S(t) m and the probability of system failure. In general, the effect of increasing the FDF will be larger when the probability of system failure is larger. Therefore, the reduction achieved by increasing the FDF from 2 to 4 will be larger than that from 4 to 6. For ∆t I = 2 yr, increasing FDF d from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 6, reduces the probability of system failure at the end of service life by 51% and 46%, respectively. For the same reason, the reduction will be larger when no inspections are conducted. In that case, 83% reduction of the probability of failure is achieved by increasing FDF d from 2 to 4 and 67% by increasing FDF d from 4 to 6.</p></div>

The optimal I&amp;M strategies for designs 1, 2 and 3 are two, five and ten years, respectively. The optimal integrated design, which is defined according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>), is found to be {D opt , S opt } = {Design 3, ∆t I = 10 years}. It can be observed that, for the given cost model, it is cost-efficient to invest in a more conservative design. This initial investment in the construction of the structural details is compensated by a reduced expected investment in inspections and repairs.</p><p>It can also be seen that allowing for a slightly larger risk and inspecting every ten years instead of five is cost-effective.</p><p>The FDF has a clear effect on the expected consequences of failure. In particular, the effect is easily appreciated for the cases with no inspections, where the expected cost is dominated by the risk of failure, particularly for smaller values of the FDF. For FDF d = 2, the expected life-cycle cost associated with no inspections is disproportionate compared to the cases with inspections, being approximately 11 times larger than for ∆t I = 2 years. The importance of the FDF is less evident when an intensive inspection control is performed, such as for ∆t I = 2 years, where the expected life-cycle cost is approximately the same for all the tested designs. In general, it is observed that increasing the FDF shifts the optimal I&amp;M policies towards longer inspection intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of the annual discount rate</head><p>The estimation of the expected life-cycle cost E[C T ] is sensitive to the annual discount rate i r . Typical values of the annual discount rate range between 0.02 and 0.05. In order to study the influence of the annual discount rate on optimal life-cycle decisions, the expected life-cycle cost is plotted for these two values as a function of the inspection interval ∆t I and for the three designs in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">15</ref>. It can be observed that increasing i r from 0.02 to 0.05 leads to a significant reduction of</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">E[C T ]</formula><p>. This reduction mainly concerns the risk of failure term. For the case of no inspections and FDF d = 2, the risk of failure decreases by approximately 40%. Fortunately, the optimal choice of an inspection interval is more robust with regard to changes of this parameter. For this particular case study, the optimal I&amp;M planning given each of the three design specifications remains the same for both values of the annual discount rate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The presented framework can be used to assess a cost-effective balance between the design investments and expected I&amp;M costs and inform about the efficiency of the safety measures. The paper focuses on fatigue deterioration, but the framework can be applied to other phenomena, such as corrosion. Moreover, information about the importance of the components regarding system structural integrity, the components dependency and the inspectability of a structural detail can be efficiently utilized for the identification of optimal design decisions.</p><p>The framework only considers decisions related to structural deterioration in order to keep the model as simple as possible. Therefore, not all aspects that a structural design should consider are contemplated in the model. Nevertheless, it is expected that I&amp;M planning decisions will mainly influence the design decisions related to deterioration. Additional limit states could be added ad-hoc into the model. For instance, serviceability limit states such as maximum allowed deflection, could be added as a design constraint. Alternatively, additional limit states could be taken into account in a prior assessment of the design.</p><p>Another limitation of the model is its computational demand. Although it increases linearly with the number of hot-spots, the increase is exponential with the amount of random variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Luque and Straub 2016)</ref>. The computational demand also increases dramatically with the number of inspection campaigns. Using an Intel Xeon Gold 6132 processor, the computational time per sampled history grows from ca. 22 s when no inspections are conducted to ca. 230 s for ∆t I = 2 years. Additionally, 2 N push-over analysis (with N being the number of structural elements that contain fatigue prone details) are to be performed prior to the generation of the BN in order to estimate the reliability of the damaged system. This becomes intractable for relatively small systems. For 12 structural elements, 4096 analysis are to be performed. Assuming that a push-over analysis takes in average 20 s, this requires ca. 22 h. For 14 elements, which is still a small number of components for e.g. an offshore jacket structure, the push-over analysis requires approximately 4 days. Therefore, for structures with more than say 12 components, a smart selection of the cases is to be performed beforehand. This could be done by identifying for which cases the structure is structurally under-determinate or by ranking the elements based on their contribution to the probability of system failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Luque and Straub 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kim et al. 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further research</head><p>The proposed framework can be used to assess the optimal trade-off between investments in design and I&amp;M for a particular structure or portfolio of structures. Unfortunately, identified optimal decisions may not ensure a sufficient safety level from a societal point of view. The marginal life-saving cost principle together with the life-quality index can be used to assess if risk can be further mitigated in a cost-effective way according to societal preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nathwani et al. 1997)</ref>. This assessment should be conducted considering all reasonable mitigation measures.</p><p>There are challenges associated with the implementation and dissemination of the proposed model. Currently, applying the framework to systems with a large number of deteriorating components or using deterioration models with more stochastic parameters than the one used in this paper is computationally unfeasible. Moreover, due to the complexity of the model, building the model and interpreting the results require of expert knowledge. Nevertheless, the insight that can be gained from it could be summarized as prescription rules and requirements for reliability-based design.</p><p>Standards such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">ISO (2015)</ref> prescribe acceptable safety levels according to the consequence class and the relative costs of the safety measures. The proposed framework can be used to extend the differentiation of prescribed safety level to consider the level of inspectability of a structural detail.</p><p>In addition, the proposed framework can be used to find the optimal safety level at the design stage given the characteristics of the system, the relative cost of safety measures and a consequence class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A risk-based decision framework for the design of large infrastructure systems was presented in this paper. The proposed framework presents an enhanced formulation of the design decision problem in which design decisions can be made taking aspects of inspection planning into account.</p><p>The framework focuses on fatigue design and the optimal allocation of resources to mitigate risk of fatigue failure. The framework considers system effects. This has an impact on the quantification of the reliability of the structure and the optimization of the mitigation measures.</p><p>The methodology was implemented to a simple example, an offshore lattice structure subject to fatigue deterioration. Considered mitigation measures are the specification of the fatigue design factors of the hot-spots as well as the time interval between inspections and possible repair.</p><p>Inspections were assumed imperfect and therefore their outcome was associated with uncertainty.</p><p>Furthermore, not all hot-spots were considered to be accessible. The example showed the feasibility of the methodology and documented the challenges in its implementation. Results show a significant influence of the periodicity of inspections and the fatigue design of components on the life-cycle risk. It is seen that optimal fatigue design is enhanced by the consideration of life-cycle risk mitigation measures.     Crack length at hot-spots HS1, HS2,...,HS10 Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.

It is seen that the estimation of E[C T ] is associated with relatively large uncertainties. Nonetheless, this accuracy is sufficient to compare the effect of the different I&amp;M strategies and to assess the optimal integrated design for the explored decision alternatives.</figDesc></figure>
