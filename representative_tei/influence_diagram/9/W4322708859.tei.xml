<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Reducing the cost of transportation is one of the main tasks of highway and industrial rail transport. At railway enterprises, the most costs are associated with station operations. These costs can be with the reception, processing, dispatch of trains and the work of maniacs. The main difference between industrial railway stations from stations in main transport is that the work in it is managed by its departments, and the work is functioned according to the "inputtransformation-output" scheme. The work of the stations is subject to the production process at industrial enterprises, and most of the work falls on the maintenance of cargo facilities of the workshops <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Theoretical developments on the issue of reducing the loading of stations were carried out mainly for highways, since the basis of the volume of work of railway transport is the need to increase the carrying capacity of freight and stations. The research work was carried out mainly in the following areas: on the basis of the theory of mass service and imitation modeling (P.S. Gruntov, N.N. Shabalin, etc.), ensuring the interaction of peregon and stations and station elements with each other, technical equipment of stations and technologies for performing the most complex operations, that is, optimization of train construction and distribution processes (E.A. Satnikov, D.Y. Levin, P.A. In Kozlov's scientific work) the issues were cracked <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, one of the problems arising in the JSC "Uzbekiston temir yullari" (JSC "UTY" in the text) is that the loaded and empty wagons at the stations remain in excess of the established standards, as a result of which the stations are loaded. From the studies it is known that the more the station is loaded, the greater the proportion of station parking and Road busy with wagons. As a result, the number of "abaned" train will also increase. This negatively affects the speed of cargo delivery and leads to the fact that the efficiency of transportation work falls. During all periods of railway development, several scientists carried out their own research work to substantiate from the scientific side measures to eliminate the problem of reducing the loading of stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>. However, in conditions of imbalance of the wagon-flows, on the basis of rapid planning, it is necessary to normalize the Times of the standing of the wagons at the stations and thereby load the station (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).  According to the above pictures, the loading of cargo in the JSC "UTY" is on average 78% intermediate, and the unloading of cargo is on average 74% intermediate and cargo stations. In 2020, the loading and unloading of cargo compared to the last 5 years corresponded to intermediate and freight stations of 85,5% and 83,1%, respectively. These, in turn, indicate the need to quickly organize the local wagon flows on railway sections and reduce the loading of stations.</p><p>Also, to date, there is an increase in the standing of wagons at the intermediate stations of the JSC "UTY" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.) Based on the analysis, the most standing at intermediate stations dates back to the pre-shipment period when the cargo operation was completed.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Materials and Methods</head><p>The purpose of the station's operation is to ensure timely processing of trains in accordance with the requirements, strict fulfillment of transportation tasks with minimal costs. The railway station is a complex transport and technological complex of subsystems and their elements combined into a system {S} by a set of technological direct and inverse functional relationships (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). Let N t -a set of technical elements of the station, N iperformers, F -a set of technological processes, I -is a set of control actions.</p><p>The railway station as a transport system consists of the following interdependent and constantly interacting elements: technical means -trains (groups of wagons), elements of track development, means of signaling centralized blocking SCB, train and shunting locomotives; performers -locomotive crews, TXKP (technical inspection point), TKP (commercial inspection point) and technical office workers, DSP (assistant station) and DSP operator There are direct and inverse functional relationships between these elements (direct -if the change in the state of the elements occurs in the technological sequence, and the reverse -the failure of subsequent elements). Direct connections are reflected in the technological schedule of the processing of compositions. A graphical model of the technology for processing a transit train with a locomotive change in the form of a structural -time technological scheme (STTS) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. Where: T1 -receipt of arrival notification; T2 -preparation of the route; T3 -arrival of the train; T4 -uncoupling of the train locomotive; T5 -technical inspection of the train; T6 -commercial inspection of the train; T7 -reception of train documents; T8 -preparation of train documents; T9 -trailer of the train locomotive; T10 -receipt of train documents; T11 -departure of the transit train.</p><p>One of the indicators for evaluating the operation of the station as a transport system is the degree of loading. The task of controlling the station is to change the intensity of operation of the station elements μ n = {μ 1 , μ, μ, … , μ i } with the provision of load coefficients c n = {c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , … , c i } within the normative values.</p><p>Each of the service elements of the station (receiving park, exhaust path, loadingunloading front, workers of the TXP, TKP and TI, DSP, etc.) is considered as a unified unit characterized at each moment of time T by input X and output Y flows and the state of Z.</p><p>The operation of the station depends on changes in the state of their elements over time. The state of the station at time t is the number of wagons, transmissions, trains, etc. at this point in time in each element. In general, the equation of state of the station or its element will look like this:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{ z avr = f(z, x, t) y avr = g(z, x, t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where z avr = z(t) -</p><p>the state vector of a system representing a column matrix of order nxt</p><p>x avr = x(t)a control vector consisting of input variables; t -time limited by the planning period. If at the station t 1 , t 2 , t 3 … , t k ∈ T in time or its element accepts t 1 , t 2 , t 3 … , t k ∈ T modules and leaves after servicing t 1 , t 2 , t 3 … , t k ∈ T modules, then the change in the status of the T pl period is expressed by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">{ z 1 (t 1 ) = z 0 (t 0 ) + x 1 (t 1 ) -y 1 (t 1 ) z 2 (t 2 ) = z 1 (t 1 ) + x 2 (t 2 ) -y 2 (t 2 ) … … … … … z k (t k ) = z k-1 (t k-1 ) + x k (t k ) -y k (t k ) (2)</formula><p>where z o (t o ) -the state of the system at the beginning of the planned period; x 1 (t 1 ), x 2 (t 2 ), … , x k (t k ) -input to the subsystem;</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y 1 (t 1 ), y 2 (t 2 ), … , y k (t k ) -</formula><p>output from the subsystem.</p><p>Let ∆t i be the length of the time interval (∆t i ≥ 0) during which the state of the station as a system change (due to the input or output module). Average arrival interval:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I(∆t i ) avr = ∆t i /N(∆t i )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where N(∆t i )the number of received trains, train.</p><p>The intensity of entry into the system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r i (∆t i ) = N(∆t i ) = 1/I(∆t i ) avr<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The intensity of the work of the station's service elements: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">μ i (∆t i ) = 1/τ(∆t i ) (5)</formula><p>From the above formulas, the load coefficient will be equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ρ i (∆t i ) = τ i.avr I i.avr = r i /μ i<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where τ i.avraverage service time interval on ∆t i .</p><p>In the case when it is impossible to influence the intensity of incoming train traffic, the only way to influence the state of the station is to shorten the service time interval. Earlier studies have shown that in industrial transport, the number of factors affecting the organization of transportation is so large that the calculation of the service duration for each operation of the technological process of processing trains and wagons should take into account the waiting time for the start of the operation (t waiting ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. The duration of the cars' stay at the station depends on the type of train and processing technology. The sequence of operations performed with trains of various types and their duration are normalized -this is technical and commercial inspection, acceptance of documents, decommissioning of the train, reconciliation of the full-scale sheet, etc. The total duration of these operations should take into account the downtime of train in anticipation of the start of their execution of these operations. The total duration of the operation (t) is determined by the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">t = T norms + t waiting , hour<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where T norms -duration of the operation according to the norm, hour; t waitingduration of inefficient stoppage, hour Taking into account the above, the balance equation for the critical state will take the form: z(∆t i ) = z(∆t i-1 ) + ∆t i I i.avr.</p><p>-∆t i /(t waiting.i. + τ i.avr. )</p><p>To determine the system load, it is necessary to determine max z (T k ), at which there will be the maximum idle time of the trains (δ (t)) in the period t 0 , … , t k (critical period T k ). During this period, the load factor of the service elements is ρ k &gt; 1, and the input module is larger than the output module. That is, during this period, the system is filling up and it is in a critical state of max z (T k ).</p><p>The duration of the standing of the flow of i-th wagons belonging to the owner of the j-th at the station:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T ij = ∑ t ijk P ij k=1 (9)</formula><p>where t ijkduration of the k-th operation with the wagons of the i-th jet of the j-th owner, hour; P ijknumber of operations with the wagons of the i-th jet of the j-th owner;</p><p>kthe number of the operation in the technology of passing a jet of wagonflows through the station. The reduction of transport costs can be achieved through the following measures -an increase in the number of technical elements, a reduction in the duration of operations and a clearer link between the work of the station elements, with adjacent stations and serviced production workshops <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. Taking into account the imbalance of the wagon-flows, the loading of the station will increase if the time of their stay at the stations increases under conditions of increased volume. To reduce the station's loading, a train (х st.</p><p>rec. ) should be admitted to the stations, ensuring that they are not waiting in span as much as possible. The fact that the station is loaded and its processing capabilities are properly proportional to each other. When the station's train receiving capacity (Z st.</p><p>rec. ) is smaller or equal to the station's processing capacity (Z st.</p><p>proc. ), the train (х st. rec. ) is accepted to the station, and technical, commercial, and shunting work is carried out with these trains. That is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Z st.</formula><p>rec. ≤ Z st.</p><p>proc.</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">)<label>10</label></formula><p>If <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> the condition is not met, the trains will wait in excess at the station's entrance traffic light. This creates excessive use and economic costs for rail transport.</p><p>If, the station's ability to receive trains (Z st. rec. ) is always strictly equal to the station's ability (Z st. dep. ) to depart trains (formula 11), there will be no problems with sending by receiving a train from that station:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Z st. rec. = Z st. dep.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>In this case (х st. rec. ) trains can also be transferred and depart without stopping from the station. Summarizing the formulas ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>), the following result can be obtained:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Z st. rec. = Z st. dep. ≤ Z st. proc.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>If the condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) is met, the condition of the general bandwidth of the station (condition for receiving the train, handling and sending it) is considered fulfilled. Another of the problems that are currently facing is the fact that, as a result of the increase in the station's load, the duration of the operations performed with trains coming for processing is not predicted in advance. This problem is mainly related to the construction of multi-group trains at technical stations at the station and their placement on the train traffic chart. The fact that in the reception of multi-group trains to the technical station the wagons in the composition are chaos in terms of their destination, and a lot of time is spent on assembling these types of trains at technical stations, is causing the aforementioned problem.</p><p>If the (Х st. rec. ) train shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> is chosen to belong to the multi-group train category, the location of the wagons within the train will be as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Х st. rec. = х 10 1 + х 2 1 + х 7 1 + х 5 1 +х 8 1 + х 4 1 + ⋯ + х n 1 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>this place is 10, 2, 7,..., n-numbers are the destination addresses of the wagons in the composition;</p><p>"1" is the station number that processes this train. At the first station, the structural structure of the restructure and dispatching (Х st. dep. ) train will be as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Х st. dep. = х 2 2 + х 3 3 + х 4 4 + х 5 4 +х 6 5 + х 7 6 + ⋯ + х n n ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The issue of forming a formula expression ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>) from the expression indicated in formula (13) using optimal methods by scientists who have carried out scientific activities in the field and placing it on the graph of train movement in the most optimal methods has not been studied at the complex level <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p><p>To determine a comprehensive solution to this issue, there is a need to optimize the processing capabilities of the station. (Z st.</p><p>proc. ) the processing capacity of the station according to the formula ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) includes three indicators. These are:</p><p>-the pace of receiving trains to the station (J rec. ); -the pace of qualifying hill located at the station (J hill ); -the pace of departure train from the station (J dep. );</p><p>The processing capacity of the station is taken to be equal to the sum of these indicators. That is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Z st. proc. = J rec. + J hill + J dep. ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>As a result of the maximum use of processing capacity of the station, the problems of transition from Х st.</p><p>rec. to Х st. dep. will be significantly solved.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Z st. proc. → max,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>We connect the expression ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>) to the formulas ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">15</ref>) and form the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Т st. = Х st. rec. /Z st. proc. =&gt; { Х st. rec. Х st. dep. } → min,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where Tst -time of stopping received train at the station; From the diagram above, it can be seen that the higher the processing capacity of the station, the less time trains have to stand at the station. But, given that the arrival duration of the receiving trains is variable, it can be seen that this type of diagram does not always justify itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results and Discussion</head><p>Increasing the load of technical stations from the norm has a significant impact on the processing capacity of this station. It can be seen that the processing capacity of stations in the JSC "UTY" is not enough to direct the wagon-flows on time and at their addresses, and as a result, the loading rate of some stations has increased. Therefore, due to the processing capabilities of the stations, one of the urgent problems is the organization of the wagon-flows at the technical stations of the railways on the basis of a perfect and unified technological system.</p><p>At the technical stations of the railway, cargo and commercial (technical) operations are performed more often than at other types of stations. In "Tashkent" MTU UC content sorting, the schematic location of the plot, passenger, cargo and intermediate stations is indicated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>).</p><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, stations (mainly technical stations) that are currently high in load are specified separately. From among these stations, the highest level of load on the Chukhursoy station is coming straight. One of the main reasons for this is the location of this station.  Today, the flow of trains through Kazakh railways to JSC "UTY" enters mainly through the "Sari-Agach" international crossing point (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>. The results of the study show that the main transit wagon-flows transported to this day practically passes through the "Keles" junction station, which is operating at the peak of its carrying capacity). The main part of the flow of freight trains entering through the Sari-Agach international crossing point (usually 80 %) is accepted for processing to the Chukhursoy station.</p><p>The location of the stations and the direction of movement of the wagon-flows indicate that the trains to the Chukhursoy station are taken in the direction of "Sari-Agach -Keles -Chukhursoy" in the first place, and the wagon-flows coming out through these addresses are also processed at the Chukhursoy station and attached to the contents. A large amount of outgoing trains from the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan to other foreign countries also accounts for the share of this station.</p><p>A number of large projects are being developed with the neighboring Republic of Kazakhstan to eliminate the above problem and also to attract additional volumes of cargo transportation in contact with Kazakhstan and, in turn, to create an opportunity to reduce the intensity of the existing "Sari-Agach -Keles" border crossing. As one of these major projects, it can be noted that Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are planning to build the "Darboza -Pakhtaorol" railway line <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>. For the Republic of Kazakhstan, the construction of the Darbaza -Pakhtaoral "New railway line" is necessary, since every day the wagons remain motionless, waiting for the passage through the "Sari-Agach -Keles" interstate junction. It would be attractive for the Republic of Uzbekistan to develop a new railway line in "Uchkuduk -Kyzylorda" in stages. This line can be a good foundation for a new transport corridor in connection with the beginning of the construction of "Termez-Mazari Sharif -Kabul -Peshawar", firstly, the release of the entire Tashkent, and secondly, the attraction of new cargo flows in the northsouth direction, and thirdly, the construction of "Termez-Mazari Sharif".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>1. In order for the railway station to work more efficiently, it is necessary to keep all the elements of this station at the same load and, mainly, to ensure its reduction for the most loaded elements. 2. This can be achieved through the following measures-increasing the number of technical elements, reducing the duration of operations and more accurately connecting the work of E3S Web of Conferences 371, 06011 (2023) <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202337106011">https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202337106011</ref> AFE-2022 the station elements, and improving the work carried out with neighboring stations, as well as with service cargo facilities 3. In order to eliminate the emerging problem, the Chukhursoy station should improve the processing system with foreign and domestic wagons or, in order to reduce the load, entrust a certain part of the work carried out at the station to other stations adjacent to it. But this project can generate many economic costs. 4. The construction of the "Darbaza -Pakhtaoral" railway line can be chosen as the best plan for reducing the intensity of trains in Tashkent knot. In this case, not only the intensity of trains in Tashkent knot will be reduced, but also the loading and delivery time of cargo at technical stations in this knot will be reduced. As a result, the level of loading of technical stations changes in the amount of sensations, and the time of standing of wagons at the station decreases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
