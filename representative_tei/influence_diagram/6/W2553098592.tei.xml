<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mechanisms by which childhood socioeconomic status (CSES) affects adult mental health, general health, and well-being are not clear. Moreover, the analytical assumptions employed when assessing mediation in social and psychiatric epidemiology are rarely explained. The aim of this paper was to explain the intermediate confounding assumption, and to quantify differential recall bias in the association between CSES, childhood abuse, and mental health (SCL-10), general health (EQ-5D), and subjective well-being (SWLS). Furthermore, we assessed the mediating role of psychological and physical abuse in the association between CSES and mental health, general health, and well-being; and the influence of differential recall bias in the estimation of total effects, direct effects, and proportion of mediated effects. The assumptions employed when assessing mediation are explained with reference to a causal diagram. Poisson regression models (relative risk, RR and 99% CIs) were used to assess the association between CSES and psychological and physical abuse in childhood. Mediation analysis (difference method) was used to assess the indirect effect of CSES (through psychological and physical abuse in childhood) on mental health, general health, and well-being. Exposure (CSES) was measured at two time points. Mediation was assessed with both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Psychological abuse and physical abuse mediated the association between CSES and adult mental health, general health, and well-being (6-16% among men and 7-14% among women, p &lt; 0.001). The results suggest that up to 27% of the association between CSES and childhood abuse, 23% of the association between childhood abuse, and adult mental health, general health, and well-being, and 44% of the association between CSES and adult mental health, general health, and wellbeing is driven by differential recall bias. Assessing mediation with cross-sectional data (exposure, mediator, and outcome measured at the same time) showed that the total effects and direct effects were vastly overestimated (biased upwards). Consequently,</p></div>

If there is a true (unobserved) direct or indirect effect, and the direction of the differential recall bias is predictable, then the results of cross-sectional analyses should be discussed in light of that.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND AND THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS</head><p>Several psychoanalytic and cognitive theorists have proposed that the risk of psychopathology in adulthood may have roots in adverse childhood experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beck, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arieti and Bemporad, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brewin, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Safran, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blatt and Homann, 1992)</ref>. The "stress diathesis" model proposes that if genetic dispositions and stress from life experiences exceed a certain threshold, mental disorders are likely to develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brietzke et al., 2012)</ref>. Parental history of psychological problems can be used as a crude proxy for genetic predisposition to mental health problems. The complex interplay between genetic dispositions and social factors in early childhood can shape one's susceptibility, and can contribute to the development of disorders. For instance, exposure to severe stress caused by low socioeconomic status (such as malnutrition, interaction with stressed-out parents, etc.) in early childhood can make an individual more susceptible, both biologically and psychologically, to subsequent stress (such as abuse). Furthermore, some studies have suggested that childhood abuse may not occur at random, as children with behavioral problems and poor social conformity may have a tendency to put themselves in situations with a high probability of stressful events <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Plomin et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lyons et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The chains of risk model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ben-Shlomo and Kuh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lynch and Smith, 2005)</ref> suggests that childhood socioeconomic status (CSES) influences mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood through its influence on psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood. Previous studies have shown that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds are at a higher risk of experiencing psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dubowitz et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Whipple and Webster-Stratton, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Belsky, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fergusson and Lynskey, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Garbarino, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hussey et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Currie and Spatz Widom, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schilling and Christian, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Romens et al., 2015)</ref>. In turn, psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood may have a long-term impact on mental health (anxiety and depression), general health (health-related quality of life), and subjective wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., 2016a)</ref>. In this way, CSES may influence mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood, partly through psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood. However, we found no previous studies on the mediating role of psychological abuse or physical abuse in the association between CSES and mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood.</p><p>Other potential factors influencing childhood abuse are cultural (e.g., higher societal tolerance toward the abuse of boys), situational (e.g., temperament of children) or familial (e.g., lack of tolerance or hostility in parents). Some previous studies have focused on only one childhood adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kessler et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fuller-Thomson et al., 2012)</ref>, but children exposed to one type of adversity are likely to be exposed to other types of adversities in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., 2016a)</ref>. Since different adversities may be correlated and co-occur in the same individuals, we aim to address the question of whether there is an independent and unique effect of CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse in childhood on mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood, a question which has been rarely addressed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>Most studies on mental disorders have reported higher rates of traumatic experiences among women. Two potential mechanisms may explain these differences: either women are more likely to be abused, or they are more likely to report that they were abused <ref type="bibr">(and vice versa)</ref>. Studies based on self-reported information cannot distinguish between these mechanisms. However, another possibility is to assess the gender differences in self-reported information on other childhood adversities, such as socioeconomic status. Provided that the sample is representative, men and women should have the same likelihood of growing up in a household with low socioeconomic status. Therefore, a gender difference in self-reported information on CSES may indicate women are indeed more likely than men to report their childhood adversities (or vice versa). In the present study, we assess the gender differences in reporting CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse in childhood.</p><p>Furthermore, several studies have shown that psychological abuse is associated with a greater negative influence on adult health, as compared to physical abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ney, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Teicher et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dias et al., 2014)</ref>. However, these studies based their conclusions on very small study samples. In the present study, we assess and compare the influence of psychological abuse and physical abuse on mental health, general health, and well-being, using a representative sample of 10,325 respondents.</p><p>Many studies on the long-term effects of childhood adversities have focused either on a single psychiatric disorder or on selfrated health, but few studies have looked at generic measures of health-related quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Edwards et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sheikh et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sheikh et al., , 2016a) )</ref> and subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Sheikh et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., , 2016a))</ref>. Previous studies have shown that the single-item self-rated health question is an unreliable measure of health <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Crossley and Kennedy, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Zajacova and Dowd, 2011)</ref>, in contrast to disease-specific or symptom-specific measures of health <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sheikh et al., 2016b)</ref>. Similarly, over 70% of the variation in the single-item life satisfaction (well-being) question is driven by the mood of the respondent at the time the questions is asked <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Seligman, 2012)</ref>. Only one previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., 2016a)</ref> assessed the influence of psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood on a validated generic descriptive system for health-related quality of life, such as the EuroQol five dimension scale (EQ-5D). However, only the unweighted health profile (EQ-5D profile ) was used (i.e., the sum of the five dimensions). In the present study, we assess the influence of CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse in childhood on preference-based health-related quality of life in adulthood (EQ-5D utility ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROLE OF INTERMEDIATE CONFOUNDING AND DIFFERENTIAL RECALL BIAS IN ASSESSING MEDIATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intermediate Confounding</head><p>Most previous studies have assessed the mediating role of socioeconomic and behavioral factors in adulthood in the association between CSES and mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Peck, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gilman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Galobardes et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Galobardes et al., , 2008;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pudrovska and Anikputa, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Morgan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sheikh et al., 2014)</ref>. However, when assessing mediation, one assumes that there are no intermediate confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cole and Hernán, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robins, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Loeys et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sheikh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2014)</ref>. Put simply, it is assumed that there are no variables (measured or unmeasured) that affect both the mediator(s) and the outcome, or that are affected by the exposure itself (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). CSES may affect health in adolescence and early adulthood, which may in turn affect both socioeconomic status and health in adulthood. A wealthy upbringing and ample parental resources may expose children to experiences and styles of interacting that are useful for getting ahead in society. Similarly, behavioral factors in adulthood, such as alcohol and tobacco consumption are likely to be influenced by parental behavioral patterns and social environment in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., 2016a)</ref> and early adulthood. Due to the long time period between CSES, and socioeconomic status and behavioral factors in adulthood, there can be many potential intermediate confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Sheikh et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the "no intermediate confounding" assumption is difficult to satisfy. Such is the case when assessing mediators from adulthood in the association between CSES and health and well-being in adulthood.</p><p>Furthermore, the assumption of no "intermediate confounding" has rarely been explained graphically. The simplest (and broadest) definition of a confounder was given by <ref type="bibr">Hernán (2008, p. 357)</ref> as "any variable that is necessary to eliminate the bias in the analysis" (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hernán et al., 2002)</ref>. In the psychology literature, a confounder is referred to as the third (extraneous) variable (although, there is no limit on the number of potential confounders). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the hypothesized association between the exposure (independent variable of interest), the mediator, potential confounders, intermediate confounders, and the outcome (dependent variable of interest). The intermediate confounder is a mediator-outcome confounder, as it influences both the mediator and the outcome (represented by paths e and f ). Therefore under the "sequential ignorability" assumption (also referred to as "no unmeasured confounding, " "conditional exchangeability, " "selection on variables, " or "exogeneity" assumption), the intermediate confounder should be included in regression models as a confounder. However, the intermediate confounder is also influenced by the exposure (represented by path d) and acts as a mediator in the association between exposure and outcome (represented by path d * f ). Therefore, if the intermediate confounder is included as a confounder to estimate the total effect (without controlling for the mediator), then the influence of exposure through the intermediate confounder is also blocked (path d * f ). Similarly, the direct effect is supposed to represent the influence of an exposure on an outcome not mediated by the meditator. However, by adjusting for the intermediate confounder, part of the direct effect is blocked (path d * f ), and hence the direct effect will be underestimated, as it represents the influence (represented by path c) of the exposure on the outcome not mediated by the mediator and the intermediate confounder. Moreover, the indirect effect (the difference between the total and direct effect) no longer represents the influence of the exposure on the outcome via the mediator, as the path d * e * b (note that the intermediate confounder acts as a mediator between exposure and mediator) is also blocked while estimating the direct effect. Therefore, the indirect effect will also be underestimated. Since the intermediate confounder is also an intermediary (synonymous with mediator) in the association between the exposure and the mediator (path d * e) and between the exposure and the outcome (path d * f ), it creates problems when trying to break down the total effect. In the present study, we assess the role of psychological abuse and physical abuse as mediators in the association between CSES (exposure) and mental health, general health, and well-being outcomes in adulthood. Assuming that CSES is likely to precede psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood, the relatively short time period between CSES and psychological and physical abuse in childhood allows us to avoid intermediate confounding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential Recall Bias</head><p>It is well established that measurement error (or misclassification bias) in the retrospective measurement of an exposure is a concern in observational studies. A distinction must be drawn between inaccurate recall (non-differential) and recall which is biased (differential). If the error in CSES is independent of the health and well-being outcomes, conditional on confounding variables, than it is considered non-differential, i.e., it may be systematic (concern for validity), but not with regard to the health/well-being status of respondents. Measurement error in the exposure (CSES) due to health/well-being in adulthood is considered "differential measurement error bias" (commonly referred to as recall bias), if the error in CSES depends on the subject's health/well-being at the time they participated, conditional on the confounding variables. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Mausner et al. (1985)</ref> noted, "people may be more likely to search for explanations for the disease in the cases and, therefore, may assign more significance to past events." <ref type="bibr">(Mausner et al., 1985, p. 165)</ref>. On the other hand, healthy respondents may be less likely to recall a true exposure. Whether the unhealthy respondents recall their childhood socioeconomic conditions as worse than they were, or the healthy respondents recall their childhood socioeconomic status to be better, the aggregate effect of CSES on mental health, general health, and well-being will be biased upwards (overestimated). Furthermore, experts in mediation analysis propose that longitudinal data are suitable for the assessment of mechanisms or processes, as temporality is assumed between the exposure, the mediators, and the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hayes, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Preacher, 2015)</ref>. Much less attention is given to the question of how differential recall bias may bias estimates of total, direct, and indirect effects. No previous study has shown if there are any differences in estimates between analyses based on data from the same wave (cross-sectional data with exposure, mediator, and outcome measured at the same time point), and longitudinal data (exposure measured at an earlier time point). Self-reported information on childhood adversities, such as CSES may be influenced by the present mental health, general health, and wellbeing. For instance, if CSES is measured retrospectively at the same time point as health, unhealthy respondents may recall their CSES to be worse than it was (and vice versa), resulting in an overestimation of total and direct effects. However, no previous study has assessed the direction of differential recall bias for a subjective measure of childhood adversity, such as CSES and its influence on total, direct, and proportion of mediated effects. In this study we use the same exposure (CSES) measured at two time points, and compare the total, direct, and proportion of indirect effect estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the Study</head><p>Using a representative sample from a large cohort study in Norway, we assessed: (i) the gender differences in self-reported CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse in childhood; (ii) the influence of CSES on psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood; (iii) the influence of CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse on mental health (Hopkins Symptoms Check List-10, SCL-10), general health (EQ-5D), and subjective wellbeing (satisfaction with life scale, SWLS); (iv) the mediating role of psychological abuse and physical abuse in the association between CSES and mental health, general health, and well-being, and; (v) the role of differential recall bias in the estimation of total, direct, and proportion of mediated effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIAL AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p>The Tromsø Study is a prospective cohort study which started in 1974 and contains data from 40,051 respondents. Tromsø Study participants are considered representative of the adult population residing in the municipality of Tromsø, Norway <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jacobsen et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Between 1974</ref><ref type="bibr">Between and 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">Between -2008</ref>, six waves of the Tromsø Study were conducted (referred to as Tromsø I-VI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jacobsen et al., 2012)</ref>. The present study is based on 10,325 respondents participating in both .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures of Mental Health, General Health, and Well-Being</head><p>Mental health, general health, and well-being was measured in the Tromsø VI questionnaire. We transformed all outcomes on the same scale [0-10], so that meaningful comparison could be made between estimates.</p><p>Mental health status (anxiety and depression) was measured by the SCL-10, which is widely used in epidemiological studies. Respondents rated each of the 10 items in the SCL-10 on a four-point scale ranging from not at all (1) to extremely (4). We found an acceptable degree of internal consistency for the four-point scale in this sample (Cronbach's alpha 0.86, mean inter-item correlation: 0.41, McDonald's omega coefficient for composite reliability: 0.87). A composite variable was constructed as the sum of the 10 items. The total sum of scores were linearly transformed to lie on the scale [0-10], where 10 represented the worst mental health and 0 represented perfect mental health [mean: 0.89, standard deviation (SD): 1.20].</p><p>General health was assessed with the EQ-5D generic measure of health-related quality of life. Each health dimension has three levels: (1) no problems, (2) some problems, and (3) unable or extreme problems. Utility weights for EQ-5D utility health states was based on the widely used UK value set <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dolan, 1997)</ref>. These weights lie on a scale on which perfect health and being dead have a score of 1 and 0, respectively. The scores was linearly transformed to lie on the scale [0-10]; where 10 represented the lowest general health, and 0 represented perfect general health (mean: 1.36, SD: 1.61).</p><p>Well-being was measured by the response to the first three items on the SWLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Diener et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sheikh et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sheikh et al., , 2016a))</ref>. These were "In most ways my life is close to my ideal, " "The conditions of my life are excellent, " and "I am satisfied with my life." Respondents rated these statements using a 7-point scale ranging from completely disagree (1) to completely agree (7). A composite variable was constructed as the sum of the three items. The total sum of scores were linearly transformed to lie on the scale [0-10]; where 10 represented the lowest well-being, and 0 represented the highest well-being (mean: 2.68, SD: 1.98).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Childhood Socioeconomic Status</head><p>Self-rated childhood financial condition was used as the indicator of CSES, and was measured in both the Tromsø IV and Tromsø VI questionnaires by the question, "How was your family's financial situation during childhood?" on a 4-point scale (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = difficult, 4 = very difficult). The testretest reliability of CSES was good (Kappa weighted : 0.63, 99% CI: 0.61-0.65) in this sample (data not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Abuse and Physical Abuse in Childhood</head><p>Psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood were used as mediators. Self-reported information on psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood was collected in the Tromsø VI questionnaire by the question: "Have you over a long period experienced any of the following? (as a child)." The possible responses included: (i) "Being tormented, or threatened with violence" and; (ii) "Being beaten, kicked, or the victim of other types of violence." Respondents could tick one or both responses. Those who ticked the first response were classified as having experienced psychological abuse in childhood, while those who ticked the second response were classified as having experienced physical abuse in childhood.</p><p>To assess whether there is an additive effect of childhood abuse on mental health, general health, and well-being, we constructed a separate variable of Abuse frequency: 0 = not exposed to psychological or physical abuse (reference), 1 = exposed to either psychological or physical abuse, 2 = exposed to both psychological and physical abuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confounders</head><p>Data on confounders were taken from the Tromsø IV questionnaire. The potential confounders age, gender, exposure to passive smoke in childhood (yes, no), living in Norway at age 1 (yes, no), mother's history of psychological problems, and father's history of psychological problems, were chosen based on a priori knowledge of the association between the exposures, mediators, and outcomes under study <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Sheikh et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sheikh et al., , 2016a</ref>). Mother's/father's history of psychological problems was measured as: "Does your mother/father have/has your mother/father ever had psychological problems?" (yes, no).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>All analyses were conducted using Stata version 13. Assuming that data was missing at random (MAR), imputed values were generated with multiple imputation (with chained equations), to avoid any bias in the association of interest introduced by excluding individuals with missing data. 100 multiple datasets are generated to help account for the uncertainty in the imputation procedure. In order to increase the predictive power of the imputation procedure, we included all indicators of mental health, general health, and well-being in the imputation models. A comparison between the complete-case (excluding missing) and the imputed dataset is presented with proportions (%), and mean (standard error, SE). All statistical analyses were performed on imputed dataset.</p><p>All confounding variables were tested for pairwise multiplicative interaction with CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse with logistic, Poisson, and linear regression (Ordinary least square, OLS) models. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) multiplicative interactions were observed with gender. Lower CSES among women was associated with a significantly lower mental health, general health, and well-being, as compared to men (data not shown).

Lower CSES (Tromsø IV) was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with psychological abuse (RR = 1.85 among men and RR = 1.90 among women), physical abuse (RR = 1.60 among men and RR = 1.82 among women), and abuse frequency (RR = 1.74 among men and RR = 1.87 among women) in childhood (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). The association between CSES and psychological abuse was stronger than that between CSES and physical abuse for both men and women (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). Furthermore, the associations were stronger for women than men (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</p><p>Confounding variables must not be a consequence of CSES, and lie on the causal path between CSES and psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood. If confounding variables were influenced by CSES, the adjusted estimates would be weaker than the unadjusted estimates. The adjusted estimates were higher than the unadjusted estimates, indicating that none of the confounding variables act as mediator in the association between CSES and psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood. This also suggests that confounding variables are not intermediate confounders in CSES→abuse→MH/GH/WB association. Generally, the association between CSES measured at the same time point (Tromsø VI) as the psychological or  physical abuse, was stronger than the association with CSES measured at an earlier point in time (Tromsø IV) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). Among women, the % differences between estimates of CSES in Tromsø IV and Tromsø VI indicate that the association between CSES in Tromsø VI and psychological abuse was 14.45% (99% CI: 6.20-24.91) stronger. Similarly, the association between CSES in Tromsø VI and physical abuse was 27.47% (99% CI: 5.95-39.49) stronger among men, while it was 17.83% (99% CI: 5.25-32.29) stronger among women. Moreover, there was a pattern between men and women.

The % differences in Model 3 and 4 indicate that some of the association between psychological abuse and mental health, general health, and well-being is driven by differential recall bias (2.66-8.28%, p &lt; 0.05 among men vs. 6.44-9.75%, p &lt; 0.001 among women).

After adjusting for confounding variables, lower CSES (Tromsø IV) was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with lower mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood for both men and women. Lower CSES (Tromsø IV) led to lower mental health and well-being among women, as compared to men.

Although childhood abuse may occur to a different extent among boys and girls, even within the same family, the differences in subjective CSES reports indicate that men are more likely to report lower CSES than women (although the effect size was small) in this Norwegian sample. This might also suggest that contrary to previous studies, men are more likely to report psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood.</p><p>Estimates of both CSES in Tromsø IV and Tromsø VI are presented for comparison purposes. The association between the exposure (CSES) and mediators measured at the same time point was stronger than the association with exposure measured at an earlier time point. This reflects that in a cross-sectional analysis, some of the association between CSES and psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood is driven by recall bias (biased upwards).</p><p>The differential recall bias in this study indicates that among all the variables measured in Tromsø VI (CSES, psychological abuse, physical abuse, mental health, general health, and well-being), it may be that some of the associations are due to shared method variance, i.e., those with low mental  , where 0 represents perfect mental health, and 10 represents worst mental health.

Since psychological abuse and physical abuse were only measured in Tromsø VI, the differential recall bias in these variables could not be assessed comprehensively. However, the pattern of findings suggest that questions that aim to measure a subjective evaluation (such as CSES, which ranged from very good to very difficult) are strongly influenced by recall bias, while questions measuring concrete events (such as childhood abuse) might be less influenced by recall bias. For example, previous studies assessing the cross-sectional association of subjective CSES, fathers' education, and mothers' education (adjusted for one another) with adult health and well-being has shown that subjective CSES had the strongest influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mäkinen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sheikh et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sheikh et al., , 2016a))</ref>. These findings might be driven by differential recall bias in subjective CSES, more so than the recall of parental education.</p><p>The results indicate that controlling for differential recall bias is important in observational studies. The main conclusion that can be drawn about the differences in estimates using CSES from two time points is that if there is a true (unobserved) direct or indirect effect, and the direction of the differential recall bias is predictable, than the results of cross-sectional analyses should be discussed in light of that. Using an empirical example, the results of this study indicate that research based on cross-sectional analyses between a subjective childhood adversity, and its influence on present mental health, general health, and well-being are vastly overestimated (biased upwards). Therefore, it is particularly important to note, that if the effect size is small, then the results (and consequently the inferences) are tentative. We recommend that future studies (using self-reported information) should adjust for a subjective evaluation of present or past attributes (such as subjective CSES) to account for recall bias.</p><p>Consistent with most previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dubowitz et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Belsky, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fergusson and Lynskey, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Garbarino, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hussey et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Currie and Spatz Widom, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kendler and Aggen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schilling and Christian, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Romens et al., 2015)</ref>, though not all <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Connelly and Straus, 1992)</ref>, lower CSES was associated with psychological or physical abuse in childhood.

However, as <ref type="bibr">Imai et al. noted (2011, p. 12)</ref>, "It is worth recalling that, in general, research with observational data is built upon a strong assumption that conditional on covariates the treatment variable is ignorable. Despite this, much can be learned from observational data. In fact, many social science theories result from simple observations and many experimental studies confirm the results of observational studies." <ref type="bibr">(Imai et al., 2011, p. 12)</ref> Therefore, replication of this study's aim of assessing the impact of CSES on mental health, general health, and wellbeing, and the mediating role of childhood abuse is needed in other settings. Other assumptions for assessing mediation include "no interference, " implying that an individual's outcome is not influenced by the exposure status of another person (also referred to as SUTVA, the stable unit treatment value assumption).</p><p>The precise timing of CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse was not measured, and the temporality between these factors is assumed in this paper. The results of this study certainly do not imply that parents with low SES abuse their children, because information about the "abuser" was not measured, and psychological abuse and physical abuse were independent predictors of mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood after controlling for CSES.</p><p>All outcomes were transformed into a [0-10] scale to facilitate comparison between the estimates in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. This by no means implies that a one-unit difference in subjective well-being is equivalent to a one-unit difference in mental health or healthrelated quality of life, but the effect size is comparable statistically, if not theoretically.</p><p>The strengths of this study are its large sample size, which is representative of the adult population of Tromsø. Furthermore, it includes three indicators of childhood adversities (CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse), and their association with three validated multi-item instruments of mental health, general health, and well-being. The methodological strength of the study is that due to the relatively small time-period between CSES, psychological abuse, and physical abuse in childhood, the intermediate confounding assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cole and Hernán, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robins, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2014)</ref> (also referred to as the "fourth assumption" or "no exposureinduced mediator-outcome confounder") can be satisfied in this design.</p><p>In this study, the intermediate confounding assumption is explained with reference to social and psychiatric epidemiology. Using an empirical example from a large cohort study, the extent of differential recall bias in total, direct, and proportion of mediated effects is presented. The results show that total and direct effects were overestimated (biased upwards) in crosssectional analysis. Consequently, the proportion of mediated effects were underestimated (biased downwards).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT</head><p>Lower childhood socioeconomic status (CSES) is associated with lower mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood. However, the mechanisms by which CSES affects adult mental health, general health, and well-being are not clear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS</head><p>Psychological abuse and physical abuse in childhood mediates the association between childhood socioeconomic status and mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood. The findings suggest that associations between childhood adversity and adult mental health, general health, and wellbeing, based on cross-sectional analyses, are vastly overestimated (biased upwards). Therefore, controlling for differential recall bias is important in observational studies (using self-reported information).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 2 |</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIGURE 2 | Effect (OLS estimates) of childhood socioeconomic status (Tromsø IV), psychological abuse, and physical abuse in childhood on mental health, general health, and well-being in adulthood (adjusted for each other and confounding variables).</figDesc><graphic coords="14,105.76,69.26,383.22,459.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>
