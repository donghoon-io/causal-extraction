<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One resource indispensable for securing the capacity to carry out processes is an environment made up of social, psychological, physical and other factors. The nature of such environmental factors and the manner in which they affect the capacity to carry out processes and produce goods and/or services translates into a company's ability to meet the expectations of stakeholders, including the organization's customers. In order to define the preconditions for the efficient implementation of processes, it is necessary, among others, to ascertain the manner in which such preconditions influence process operation. One of the criteria that should be applied in such an assessment is the impact of working environment factors (temperature, lighting, noise, toxicity, dust, electromagnetic fields) on the ability to carry out work processes effectively. The paper accounts for working environment factors seen as parameters for the assessment of processes and as criteria for ascertaining the ability to perform work. The impact of the working environment on the capacity to conduct processes was assessed by means of a relationship diagram.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The acquisition of the capacity to carry out production processes ties irretrievably to ensuring a proper working environment for the labor force. Its pivotal part is the physical working environment whose specifications determine workers' ability to perform work and the organization's ability to ensure safety for persons responsible for work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In assessing an enterprise's capacity to carry out tasks, particular emphasis should be placed on the processes employed in transforming stakeholder expectations into outcomes resulting from the provision of services, the manufacturing of products or decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The ability to carry out internal and other processes defines the ability to perform such tasks.</p><p>To conduct processes, an enterprise needs to ensure access to appropriate resources which will allow it to carry them out without unnecessary hindrances and limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Such resources are technical, organizational, human, financial and other. Frequently, being in their possession or having the ability to acquire them is a precondition for attaining a company's objectives. Such resources include the ability to adopt solutions that increase the capacity to perform work. One such solution is the establishment of a working environment that will not disrupt work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The acquisition of resources should be preceded by an analysis of the existing state of working conditions.</p><p>One measure of equal importance for conducting the process is to identify criteria for evaluating an organization's performance. This is particularly vital for carrying out tasks that constitute a process, that are subject to systemic standards (e.g. the standards of a quality management system), and that require comparing work outcomes with any preliminary precepts and targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Process description and process performance conditions</head><p>Processes should be defined as a collection of mutually interrelated actions that influence one another and that are undertaken to transform inputs into outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. A simplified process-based task performance diagram is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. To ensure that the transformation of inputs into outputs proceeds effectively, it is critical to consider the impact of conditions on process performance and minimize any existing or potential disruptions. A precondition for the effective performance of tasks in a process-based system is to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>: Identify, in advance, all processes found in an organization, arrange them into a sequence, recognize their mutual impacts, define input and output requirements and identify the processes that are particularly critical for the proper performance of tasks, Define the principles and methods for overseeing process performance, and Implement actions necessary for the achievement of planned outcomes and continuous process improvements. The systemic approach employed in pursuance with ISO 9001 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> may be associated with the view of an enterprise as a sum total of the effects of its processes. A process that underpins a given approach may be seen as a way to carry out tasks. Such tasks are defined in terms of the mutual relationships among them with a focus on organizational units, workstations and functions. Here, a particular role needs to be ascribed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>:</p><p>The conditions in which specific tasks are conducted and which are central to an organization's ability to acquire and transform resources that are critical for the achievement of specific outcomes, Any disruptions that adversely affect the ability to carry out a process defined as a transformation of inputs into outputs. Every process disruption compromises an organization's ability to generate specific benefits. As such, it should be eliminated at the level of the components and specifications of a given process.</p><p>The performance of processes and the interrelations among them are influenced substantially by the environment in which the processes are conducted. Success in their improvement depends on the impacts of all component elements that affect process performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>As a prerequisite for its ability to improve its processes, an organization should <ref type="bibr">[2-4, 10, 11]</ref>:</p><p>Plan its actions and specifically identify its objectives and secure the required resources, including the environment in which the planned actions are to be taken, Make proper organizational arrangements such as the assignment of tasks and responsibilities and the acquisition of resources that are adequate to tasks and that enable the organization to respond to changes in the conditions in which tasks are performed, Lead and motivate the entities involved in the performance of specific tasks, Monitor the process by acquiring information on the effectiveness of conducting the planned actions. In order to be capable of performing processes, an organization needs to secure the appropriate resources, including conditions for process performance. A key role among such resources is played by the working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In an employee-friendly organization, processes are performed under strictly specified conditions which secure the satisfaction of worker needs and expectations and ensure working comfort and worker well-being. Another prerequisite for effectiveness is to abandon the policy of limiting controls to external procedures. Every employee should care for a specified section of their process thereby contributing to increases in work efficiency and ensuring that the tasks at hand are performed professionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Working environment factors as process performance determinants 3.1 Impact of working environment factors on the ability to conduct processes</head><p>The working environment parameters defined for a workstation may be used as indicators in evaluating process performance conditions and as criteria for verifying workers' ability to operate and perform work in a specific working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The working environment may be described in terms of the level of negative and positive impacts on the worker.</p><p>Any negative or positive impacts exerted by working environment factors are a function of the conformity of working environment characteristics, as measured by means of specific indicators, with the criteria prescribed to achieve welfare in the working environment and ensure the ability of human operators to work efficiently. Where no negative impacts take place, i.e. where no such factors exist as would potentially disrupt the proper operation of processes, the broadly-defined capacity to perform occupational tasks in a proper manner is greatly increased. Such a capacity produces the following key benefits at enterprise level <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>:</p><p>A reduction in losses caused by occupational accidents and diseases, Increased levels of employee motivation, teamwork and morale, A more efficient spending of funds earmarked to improve occupational safety, Greater efficiency in the performance of work Unscheduled workloads (costs) reduced by effectively planning to achieve work continuity, Prevention of work disruptions and successful retention of most valuable workers, Reduced insurance expenses, Improved enterprise image and reputation, Lower risk of civil liability lawsuits. All of the above benefits contribute to boosting the enterprise's bottom line. Such impacts are identified with reference to the indicators and parameters used in assessing elements of the working environment. Depending on their level, individual impacts may be viewed as deleterious (hazardous) or untoward <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The most critical of them are such working environment factors as temperature (characteristics of the thermal environment), workstation and workplace lighting, noise and vibrations which affect workers, toxicity resulting from the use of chemicals and their mixtures in the work process, non-toxic dust, electromagnetic fields and, e.g. laser radiation levels. Their effect may be assessed by the measuring methods that help identify the actual impact of a factor on employee health and safety and on the presentation of subjective assessments of risks by workers. In the course of such evaluations, one should bear in mind that working environment factors affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><p>Process performance, described in terms of e.g. process efficiency and effectiveness, The alignment of process outcomes with stakeholder expectations.

These include the parameters applied in the assessment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: a) The thermal environment, measured by:</p><p>The predicted mean vote (PMV) indicator which describes the thermal comfort of a person remaining in a moderate environment on a seven-point numerical scale (from -3.0 to +3.0), The conformity of the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) <ref type="bibr">[°C]</ref> with the admissible values corresponding to the ability to perform work in a hot environment, The chilling temperature indicator twc [°C] used to describe cold environments, b) Illumination, and specifically:</p><p>The mean level of illumination Eave [lx] relative to the required operating illumination, Illumination uniformity relative to the minimum allowable illumination uniformity, Light color and luminance depending on light source, measured against the requirements of the EN 12464-1:2011 standard, c) Noise loads, described in terms of:</p><p>The equivalent noise level LAeq, The maximum noise level L Amax , The peak noise level L Cpeak .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>The presumption made in the study in question was that working conditions significantly determine a man's ability to operate in a working environment and perform tasks. If such tasks are presented as a process, working environment factors need to be seen as prerequisites for work performance, whereas ensuring proper working conditions should be recognized as a disrupting factor that adversely affects process performance and the capacity to achieve the desired outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. By analyzing the issue in view of process performance described in reference to working environment factors, emphasis may be placed on the significance of working environment parameters for assessing the ability of human operators to work in specific conditions which determine their safety and their ability to perform work efficiently. Such factors are described in terms of the requirements laid down in relevant standards as well as subjective assessments by workers. Both are used in evaluating workers' ability to perform their tasks.</p><p>The relationship diagram has helped examine the issue and, on that basis, identify advisable improvement measures. The diagram has made it possible to correlate "causes" with "effects", and, as a consequence, identify links connecting individual causes. The study has found that:</p><p>The central measure required to ensure proper thermal conditions in the working environment is to select functionally appropriate clothing, To ensure that workstation illumination is adequately suited to the nature of the work performed, workers should be equipped with a portable light source, To reduce the adverse impact of noise, it is crucial to train the workers and establish rules for the use of manual mechanical tools.</p><p>The above measures should be seen as the most critical ones for improving the current conditions. The analysis also makes it possible to identify other actions and assess their usefulness for the achievement of the desired improvements. To that end, reference should be made to the number of links found in the aforesaid relationship diagrams. The links show both the sources of problems and ways to reduce their impact.</p><p>The improvement measures adopted on that basis and aimed at eliminating or mitigating disruptions should be seen as a way to increase the capacity to carry out work processes.</p><p>By applying the above methodology to workstations exposed to other disruptions in the form of deleterious, untoward and hazardous factors having a potentially harmful effect on human health, it is possible to identify the measures that should be taken. Such measures will help improve work efficiency and effectiveness and, in effect, satisfy the expectations of the concerned enterprise's stakeholders, who include its employees. The improvement measures that allow the enterprise to enhance the conditions in which its processes are performed and reduce the disruptions to which its processes are exposed will ultimately help, inter alia, to:</p><p>Improve work efficiency by e.g. reducing the time needed to complete tasks, Boost the effectiveness of task performance, Reduce loads having adverse impacts on workers, Reduce the biological cost resulting from the performance of work, Improve the quality of work, Reduce the time needed to perform tasks, Improve work productivity. While no other factors having deleterious effects on the workers were observed during the study, the insights obtained suggest that the methodology described above can be successfully employed to assess the causes of other issues. Another consideration that may prove to be of significance is the possible interactions among individual deleterious factors that may produce a synergy effect.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
