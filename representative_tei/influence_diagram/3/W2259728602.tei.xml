<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>The recently (2013) identified pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), poses a severe threat to the distribution and abundance of salamanders within the United States and Europe. Development of a response strategy for the potential, and likely, invasion of Bsal into the United States is crucial to protect global salamander biodiversity. A formal working group, led by Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Fort Collins Science Center, and Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, was held at the USGS Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis in Fort Collins, Colorado, United States from June 23 to June 25, 2015, to identify crucial Bsal research and monitoring needs that could inform conservation and management strategies for salamanders in the United States. Key findings of the workshop included the following: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the introduction of Bsal into the United States is highly probable, if not inevitable, thus requiring development of immediate short-term and long-term intervention strategies to prevent Bsal establishment and biodiversity decline; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> management actions targeted towards pathogen containment may be ineffective in reducing the long-term spread of Bsal throughout the United States; and (3) early detection of Bsal through surveillance at key amphibian import locations, among high-risk wild populations, and through analysis of archived samples is necessary for developing management responses. Top research priorities during the preinvasion stage included the following: (1) deployment of qualified diagnostic methods for Bsal and establishment of standardized laboratory practices, (2) assessment of susceptibility for amphibian hosts (including anurans), and (3) development and evaluation of short-and long-term pathogen intervention and management strategies. Several outcomes were achieved during the workshop, including development of an organizational structure with working groups for a Bsal Task Force, creation of an initial influence diagram to aid in identifying effective management actions in the face of uncertainty, and production of a list of potential management actions and key research uncertainties. Additional products under development include a Bsal Strategic Action plan, an emergency response plan, a monitoring and surveillance program, a standardized diagnostic approach, decision models for natural resource agencies, and a reporting database for salamander mortalities. This workshop was the first international meeting to address the threat of Bsal to salamander populations in the United States, with more than</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Amphibians are the most endangered group of vertebrates, with nearly a third of all species threatened with extinction globally <ref type="bibr">(Stuart and others, 2004</ref>; International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2015). Although habitat loss is a major threat to species persistence, amphibians on protected lands are declining because of additional stressors, such as disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Collins and Storfer, 2003)</ref>. The United States has the highest diversity of salamanders in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buckley and Jetz, 2007)</ref>. Of the 191 salamander species in the United States, many are endemic to only the southeastern states making the Unites States the global hotspot for salamander biodiversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Wiens, 2007)</ref>. Because of this, managing disease threats to U.S. salamanders is a high priority for the global conservation of salamanders.</p><p>The pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), was first described in 2013 after observations of unusual mortality among wild and captive fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) were reported in Europe <ref type="bibr">(Spitzen-van der Sluijs and others, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martel and others, 2013)</ref>. Although susceptibility to Bsal varies among species, the fungal pathogen is lethal to salamanders in the United States from the families Salamandridae and Plethodontidae <ref type="bibr">(Martel and others, 2014)</ref>. Available evidence suggests that Bsal is endemic to Asia, where it has been found in museum specimens more than 150 years old <ref type="bibr">(Martel and others, 2014)</ref>. Based on this endemicity, the discontinuity of the global incidence of Bsal, and the popularity of salamanders as pets, the original emergence of this pathogen in Europe is presumed to have occurred by way of the amphibian trade <ref type="bibr">(Cunningham and others, 2015)</ref>. More than 28 million amphibians were imported in the United States throughout a 6-year period during the last decade <ref type="bibr">(Schloegel and others, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yap and others, 2015)</ref>. Thus, there is serious concern that this pathogen has already been introduced or will be introduced into the United States in the near future through the salamander trade <ref type="bibr">(Cunningham and others, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yap and others, 2015)</ref>. This is of particular conservation concern because the eastern United States is home to 141 species in family Plethodontidae, with 1 of 3 species tested for susceptibility in this family exhibiting mortality because of Bsal exposure <ref type="bibr">(Martel and others, 2014)</ref>. Preliminary testing also determined that Bsal was lethal to other genera within the family Salamandridae: the rough-skinned newt, Taricha granulosa; and the Eastern newt, Notophthalmus viridescens <ref type="bibr">(Martel and others, 2014)</ref>. To date, this study provides the best available data for researchers to evaluate the susceptibility of other U.S. salamander species. Given the high salamander diversity and the susceptibility of some of the few species tested, the arrival of Bsal to the United States could pose a considerable threat to global salamander diversity. The susceptibility of species within Salamandridae and Plethodontidae is especially concerning because many species in these families are considered relatively common. Furthermore, limited protective status of common species typically results in limited authority for management agencies to act should Bsal be identified or population declines observed. Evidence that North American species can become infected but survive is limited to the lesser siren, Siren intermedia, and Northern slimy salamander, Plethodon glutinosus <ref type="bibr">(Martel and others, 2014)</ref>, and all infected species could act as a reservoir host if the pathogen is introduced. This pathogen has the potential to have devastating consequences for U.S. salamanders, similar to extirpations observed in frog species in South America and Australia from the related fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd; <ref type="bibr">Lips and others, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Skerratt and others, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The pace of global commerce and the accelerated emergence of new infectious diseases (that is, fungal pathogens, viruses and parasites) are increasing risk to native wildlife populations. Typically, federal and state natural resource agencies of the United States have responded to disease threats post-invasion because this is when pathogens are first detected. The identification of Bsal from die-offs in Europe and the documented threat this fungus poses to some U.S. salamanders provides a unique opportunity to develop control strategies for a novel infectious disease before widespread declines are observed in native populations. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) held a workshop (23-25 June 2015) at the USGS Powell Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, to initiate a proactive response (for example, identify management and research needs before invasion) for the likely Bsal invasion. Participants represented U.S. natural resource management agencies [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. National Park Service (NPS)], and states represented by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (AFWA), zoological parks, and academic research institutions from around the world (Australia, Netherlands, Switzerland, United States, and United Kingdom). Participants were tasked to identify research needs and potential management responses for mitigating effects of Bsal in the United States pre-and post-invasion. A Bsal invasion was framed as a crisis situation, with the United States in a precrisis stage. Precrisis and crisis stages require urgent management decisions in the face of considerable uncertainty. Participants used a decision-analytic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Keeney, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Clemen, 1996)</ref> to explicitly articulate links between research priorities, potential management strategies, and ultimately, conservation objectives. Decision analysis also provides a template for developing an adaptive management program <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Williams, Szaro, and Shapiro, 2007)</ref> in which research targets critical scientific uncertainties to improve management outcomes for Bsal and salamanders, as well as for the management of future novel infectious disease threats to wildlife. During the workshop, participants used several decision-analytic tools to aid in articulating the Bsal conservation and management problem, identifying critical scientific uncertainties and developing alternative management strategies for mitigating Bsal invasion and associated salamander declines in the United States.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stages of Bsal Invasion</head><p>Pathogen invasion can be categorized into four major stages based on disease ecology and dynamics (pre-invasion, invasion front, epidemic, and establishment). These stages can be particularly useful for identifying which alternative management actions should be applied and when they can be most effective <ref type="bibr">(Langwig and others, 2015)</ref>. Participants agreed that these stages could be challenging to identify for Bsal, and many other pathogens, because information is rarely perfect. This results in uncertainty in determining pathogen presence because of imperfect detection and in defining the invasion stage because of imperfect knowledge of system dynamics. For these stages to be useful for controlling Bsal, uncertainty must be incorporated into the assessment management strategies. During the workshop, participants focused on developing research, monitoring, and management priorities in the context of the preinvasion stage as well as all postinvasion stages combined (invasion front, endemic, and establishment). Bsal has not yet been detected in the United States; therefore, many preinvasion research and management strategies focused on invasion prevention are applicable (although surveillance efforts have thus far been limited, reducing confidence that the United States is, in fact, still in the preinvasion stage). If and when Bsal is detected in the United States, postinvasion research and management strategies could be implemented and stages within postinvasion will be explored further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preinvasion</head><p>Although Bsal has been detected in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany in association with the salamander trade <ref type="bibr">(Cunningham and others, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mills, 2015)</ref>, Bsal detection has not yet been reported in the United States; thus, early detection and prevention of Bsal introduction into captive and wild populations are top priorities to control pathogen invasion. Because commercial trade in salamanders is considered to be the most likely pathway for entry of Bsal into the United States, the Lacey Act (1990; 16 U.S.C. § § 3371-3378 and 18 U.S.C. § § 42-43) potentially could be used to minimize the opportunities for pathogen entry by restricting salamander importation. Although the Lacey Act does not allow for listing of Bsal or any pathogen as an injurious species, salamander hosts of Bsal may qualify for listing. Listing host species may effectively reduce the number of infected animals that enter the United States while a clean-trade program that requires certification of disease-free salamander importation is being developed. Neither listing as injurious nor a clean-trade program will address potential risks from black market imports and could increase that component of risk.</p><p>Aside from the Lacey Act, there are no other regulatory tools available to address and manage wildlife diseases, which was of major concern to participants. Participants stated that preventing Bsal entry into the United States was crucial because there are few effective management options for Bsal following exposure and establishment in the wild. Efforts to restrict legal importation of salamanders from Asia and Europe through major U.S. ports could be the most effective approach to prevent Bsal invasion, although participants agreed that import restrictions would be unlikely to completely mitigate the risk presented by Bsal. Under import and trade policies, salamanders may be imported into the United States without requirement to screen animals for known diseases or to quarantine potentially sick animals. Early detection of Bsal in wild populations can only be accomplished through a robust, well-designed surveillance of natural populations of salamanders and newts that responds to morbidity and mortality events reported through a well-organized database and communication network. Participants predicted the introduction of Bsal to the United States to be certain, if not imminent, and strongly recommended exploration and development of management strategies for Bsal postinvasion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Postinvasion</head><p>When Bsal is detected in the United States, immediate management actions to prevent the spread of the pathogen, such as restricting site-level access, decontaminating a site, and removal of amphibians from the site, could be considered. Participants, however, agreed that containment management responses would be ineffective in preventing the long-term spread of Bsal (that is, the invasion front may be slowed but likely will not be halted indefinitely), especially if not acted on with urgency and decisiveness on first identification. Developing management options that aid the long-term survival of amphibian populations, despite predicted Bsal invasion and establishment, is of critical importance. Some pathogen and population-level management actions, such as bioaugmentation (see <ref type="bibr">Harris and others, 2009)</ref>, selective breeding for tolerance or resistance, and prophylactic treatments, may become available to management agencies with further research and development, but participants expressed limited confidence in their applicability and efficacy (table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of alternative management strategies, a model of the system (that is, amphibian population responses to Bsal) and knowledge of the ecological state of Bsal (that is, stage of invasion based on occurrence and prevalence of Bsal) are necessary. The state of the system can be identified using surveillance data collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> at key pet-trade import and captive salamander locations; (2) in highrisk wild populations adjacent or well-connected to potential sources of entry (see <ref type="bibr">Richgels and others, unpub. data;</ref><ref type="bibr">and Yap and others, 2015)</ref>; and (3) in archived swab, tissue, and extracted DNA collections. Once the state of the system is identified, management strategies at various spatial scales (that is, national, regional, and local) could be implemented to reduce disease incidence and pathogen spread into unaffected populations.</p><p>During the workshop, natural resource management agencies and researchers articulated fundamental objectives for Bsal and salamanders within the Unites States to guide the development of management strategies and research priorities. Additionally, participants explored how management responses at differing spatial scales may change depending on the state and dynamics of the system (that is, alternative hypotheses related to disease and salamander responses). Management agencies typically have multiple mission goals, including recreational, public use, economic, ecosystem services, and conservation of species, habitats, and ecosystems, which need to be jointly considered when choosing and implementing disease management strategies. By understanding the context within which natural resource managers make decisions about Bsal, values trade-offs and risk tolerance, and the critical uncertainties that affect research directions, the choice of management actions and conservation outcomes can be explored explicitly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Uncertainties</head><p>Key uncertainties and initial research priorities were elicited from participating scientists. For each research area identified, participants estimated the cost, time, and value of reducing the uncertainty to increasing salamander persistence in response to Bsal invasion. Despite substantial variation among scientists in perceived importance, cost, and time required, researchers agreed that an immediate need included the establishment of safe and effective laboratory practices for containing Bsal. Establishing these protocols soon would allow future research to be conducted with fewer biases and systematic errors. In this sense, research deemed prerequisite to other targeted research should receive priority. Participants with experience in disease pathology cautioned against making the assumption that this pathogen behaves similarly to other fungal pathogens. For example, in Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a related fungal pathogen causing declines in amphibians, there are multiple unique strains, and virulence varies among them <ref type="bibr">(Fisher and others, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Workshop Outcomes Organizational Structure</head><p>Despite limited time to understand the rapidly evolving state of science, policy, and legal authorities for response, several important outcomes were achieved during the workshop. The first was development of a national coordination framework using the Bsal Task Force. The Bsal Task Force contained an organizational structure and seven working groups: Surveillance and Monitoring, Database Management, Response, Decision Support, Research, Diagnostics, and Outreach/Communication (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This organizational approach was modeled after other recent comprehensive response strategies for wildlife diseases in the United States (for example, "A National Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies, and Tribes in Managing White-Nose Syndrome in Bats" <ref type="bibr">(Coleman and others, 2011)</ref> and "Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies, and Tribes in Managing Chronic Wasting Disease in Wild and Captive Cervids" (<ref type="url" target="http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/fact_sheets/pdfs/cwd/cwd62602.pdf">http://www. nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/fact_sheets/pdfs/cwd/cwd62602. pdf</ref>, accessed 15 July 2015). Three important considerations follow for the organizational framework identified: (1) communication throughout the development and implementation of research and management responses is critical among and within working groups, as well as with outside entities (including the public and management agencies at all levels);</p><p>(2) working groups would likely benefit by having leads from various management agencies (a lesson learned from the white-nose syndrome disease working group); and (3) representatives from diverse stakeholder agencies should make up the Executive Oversight Group. Preliminarily, membership and leadership roles in working groups were assigned (table 2), and participants were tasked with reaching out to others to broaden the scope of participation for these working groups, as well as for the membership for the Technical Advisory Committee and Executive Oversight Group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence Diagram</head><p>Choosing optimal management action(s) for Bsal will undoubtedly require making decisions in the face of considerable uncertainty. Using tools from decision analysis, managers and researchers can assess how to best manage Bsal given a range of uncertainties and associated risk tolerances. Using the four stages of invasion for disease management framework outlined in <ref type="bibr">Langwig and others (2015)</ref>, participants created a simplified influence diagram that captured biotic and abiotic factors potentially affecting the invasion, spread, and establishment of Bsal in North American salamanders (fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Possible management options (Appendix 1) and application strategies were then elicited using the broad range of participant expertise and experiences working with other infectious wildlife diseases, including Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (an infectious cancer where the tumor cells themselves are the infectious agent), white-nose syndrome in bats caused by a fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), and chytridiomycosis in frogs caused by a fungal pathogen closely to related Bsal, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Developing a framework for linking actions, consequences, and objectives in a workshop setting with researchers and management agencies improved coordination among stakeholders and increased awareness of the importance in identifying the management context for different decision makers and stakeholders. Once the influence diagram is refined and updated with conditional probabilities and outcomes in a decision model (such as a Bayesian belief network; fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Marcot and others, 2006)</ref>, it will assist in identifying the expected effectiveness of diverse actions and the most influential sources of uncertainty. Participants contributed to the development of a simplified example of such a network, summarizing the stochastic events that determine the arrival, spread, and establishment of the pathogen; their relations with salamander population dynamics, which of those processes would be affected by specific management actions; and the final outcomes in terms of the management objectives (figs. 2 and 3). A critical and extremely useful characteristic of the influence diagram and Bayesian belief network is that it can be altered to accommodate site or region-specific environmental and decision contexts and can be updated as additional information becomes available through research and monitoring.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. List of potential action categories considered for Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) management with their expected level of effectiveness (low, moderate, high) and level of confidence (low, moderate, high) in efficacy across participants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identified Urgent Needs Response Plan for Detection</head><p>Participants urged the development of an emergency response plan to guide managers in taking action at the first detection of Bsal in captive or wild populations. This response plan is a component of a larger Bsal Strategic Action Plan (see Bsal Strategic Action Plan section below) but received high priority during the workshop because of the collective experience of the group with disease epidemics. Participants developed a set of flow charts that included notification and reporting recommendations, potential management actions for consideration, and additional surveillance and monitoring needs that are conditional on the circumstances and characteristics of the first, or first set, of detections. The Response Working Group (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) will finalize this emergency response plan, which will be revised as more Bsal information becomes available and will be available through AFWA and the Bsal Task Force.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surveillance and Monitoring Program</head><p>Pathogen and disease surveillance is essential in initiating a timely response to the likely Bsal pathogen invasion. Even though the detection of Bsal could occur from opportunistic reporting, such as submission of morbid or dead pets or encountered animals from the wild or biological supply facilities, or by sampling of archived specimens, such as those collected for Bd, a robust surveillance design provides the best chance for early detection and increases the options for limiting pathogen spread and its effects on host species in the United States. The Surveillance and Monitoring Working Group will design a program tailored to and based on the best available knowledge of Bsal. This working group will use information from two independent risk models for pathogen introduction and establishment: one model developed by Richgels and other USGS participants in the workshop (unpub. data), and another developed independently by <ref type="bibr">Yap and others (2015)</ref>. Although these analyses used different methods, both models identified overlapping locations of high risk for Bsal invasion and impact on native species. Although both models have high uncertainty, they use the best available data. An important advantage to both of the models is that new data on pathogens, host ecology, or environment can be incorporated so that surveillance strategies can be modified to take advantage of newly available information.</p><p>Participants acknowledged the importance of monitoring salamander populations in conjunction with the surveillance for Bsal and other important amphibian diseases (for example, Bd and ranavirus). Monitoring populations for pathogen occurrence and trends in population demographics can help improve risk models and prioritize where local resource managers may want to manage salamander populations and environments before the arrival of Bsal. As our understanding of high-risk locations is updated, management agencies can target public outreach and engagement with stakeholders (that is, organizations and industries involved with the movement of captive and wild salamanders), as well as state agencies, Congress, and North American collaborators from Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Importantly, a surveillance and monitoring program in the absence of a management plan has limited use for controlling impacts of Bsal on salamander populations. Participants suggested that design of a surveillance and monitoring program would include consideration of how information gathered will be used to inform management responses. Sampling designs, therefore, may need to be developed within the decision context represented in the influence diagram (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). For example, actions for site containment (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) may require information about the following: (1) the dynamics of infection at the contained site (that is, mortality of infected individuals that could indicate a fade-out or survival of individuals that could indicate that individuals are serving as vectors), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) the sampling protocol used at nearby sites that maximizes the probability of detecting pathogen arrival, and (3) surveys to assess animal movements from the contained site (to evaluate the effectiveness of containment). Resource constraints may limit the capacity of managers to collect all the desired data, forcing them to prioritize monitoring or to modify what circumstance will trigger an action. For example, actions that seek to modify between-site transmission could be triggered by determining pathogen presence at new sites through occupancy surveys, instead of more expensive tracking of individual salamanders, even if the former provides less information on the direction and magnitude of the transmission pathway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliable Diagnostic Protocols and Database Management</head><p>Participants discussed the possibility of establishing a central testing laboratory to reduce diagnostic variability, to allow for more rapid assessment of salamander mortalities, and to facilitate evaluation of diagnostic and reporting errors. Should a central testing laboratory not be possible, participants agreed that the Diagnostic Working Group could help independent laboratories collaborate to produce reliable and standardized diagnostic protocols and practices that would be shared among participating labs. The USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NHWC) is a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) collaborating center for research, diagnosis, and surveillance of wildlife pathogens. The NWHC has applied to be a reference laboratory for the related Bd pathogen and has expressed a desire to work with the Diagnostic Working Group to develop standards and serve as a primary laboratory for Bsal surveillance. The Diagnostic Working Group is beginning to develop standardized protocols that could be shared broadly across independent laboratories. This effort will address concerns about the equivalency of results from multiple laboratories. Data management and accessibility are also important parts of a coordinated diagnostic effort. Participants debated several options to address this need, including adapting existing disease databases, developing a new Bsal database, or using the USGS All Taxa Database, and agreed to create an immediately accessible interim database while a long-term reliable data management plan is being developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bsal Strategic Action Plan</head><p>Participants identified the need for an overarching Bsal Strategic Action Plan to aid amphibian conservation given the severe threat presented by Bsal. The umbrella document would include a vision statement, mission, objectives, and strategies for managing Bsal and anticipated population declines associated with the pathogen. Specific components of the Bsal Strategic Action Plan were not discussed in detail during the workshop but are being developed with input from the Executive Oversight Group, Technical Advisory Committee, and each working group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Priorities</head><p>Participants, using the collective experience of years of research and insights from studying wildlife disease (including other pathogenic fungi), discussed the best use of limited resources for researching and managing the likely Bsal invasion. The group recognized that management strategies and critical areas for research considered priority now (during the preinvasion stage of Bsal) might change as more information becomes available and uncertainties are reduced. Priorities discussed include the following:</p><p>1. Deployment of qualified diagnostic and detection methods for Bsal from swabs, tissue, preserved specimens, and environmental samples-particularly important as this information is a prerequisite to other research directions.</p><p>2. Assessment of the susceptibility in range of potential hosts, including animals other than salamanders.</p><p>3. Identification of transmission pathways to inform management control efforts, such as decontamination, quarantine, or culling.</p><p>4. Development and evaluation of the effectiveness of short-term containment measures, such as site isolation, local treatment, and methods to decontaminate sampling gear.</p><p>5. Development of long-term actions for coexistence with the pathogen, such as breeding for resistance or tolerance or both and environmental management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Products Under Development</head><p>Participants emphasized the need for effective engagement and communication from all working groups and participating institutions as part of an effective Bsal Strategic Action Plan. As a result, several groups are working on standard operating procedures and information sheets (for example, the Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Disease Task Team: <ref type="url" target="http://www.parcplace.org/parcplace/images/stories/pdf/BsalBrief.pdf">http://www.parcplace.org/parcplace/images/stories/ pdf/BsalBrief.pdf</ref>). Additionally, participants identified key stakeholder audiences outside the Bsal Task Team, including state and Federal agency biologists, pet owners, zoos, and members of U.S. and State Congressional offices who will need to be kept informed as information is gathered and strategies are designed and implemented. Continual engagement and effective communication with all stakeholder groups will be essential for protecting North America's salamanders from the serious risk posed by this invasive pathogen. Other informational products are under development and include the following:</p><p>1. Article on workshop outcomes and challenges (Grant and others, unpub. data).</p><p>2. Finalized Response Plan and overarching response coordination framework and strategy.</p><p>3. Initial development of Bsal Strategic Action Plan.</p><p>4. White paper on research needs after the influence diagram is revised using expert elicitation techniques.</p><p>5. Decision model prototypes for specific decision makers (for example, DoD, NPS, FWS).</p><p>6. Design a surveillance and monitoring protocol program.</p><p>7. Create citizen science project on iNaturalist.org to help detect salamander mortality events ("Saving Salamanders with Citizen Science"). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figures 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figures 1.
