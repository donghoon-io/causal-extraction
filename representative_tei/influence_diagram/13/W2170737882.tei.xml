<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The influence of water (in its gaseous state) on the stability of crystallized organic compounds was investigated. Through two examples of solid/vapour equilibria, several behaviours were highlighted (stoichiometric or non stoichiometric hydrates, hydration/dehydration mechanisms, stability domains of multi-hydrates as a function of relative humidity). Phase diagrams (as a function of partial water pressure) and stability diagrams have been proposed for each example. This study illustrates that solid/vapour equilibrium knowledge is a crucial step during the complete characterization of solid organic compounds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In materials science, the study of interactions between water molecules and solid compounds is of prime importance. Indeed, these interactions impact on the behaviour of materials during many steps of their development (e.g. formation of a new phase during crystallization or storage, degradation by corrosion in drastic humidity conditions, caking, etc.). In the field of organic solids, water/solid interaction play a great role as water if often used as a crystallization (co-) solvent or is present in ambient atmosphere facilitating the appearance of hydrated nuclei. Moreover, among the solvated crystalline phases, the specific class of hydrates is the most represented, in particular in pharmaceutical products <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As a consequence, the water (vapour) pressure could affect the behaviour of hydrated or anhydrous solid such as: the hydration level <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the hydration-dehydration mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the domain of deliquescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; the presence of efflorescent hydrates; the formation of stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric hydrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the decrease of the glass transition temperature for amorphous solids (water = plasticizer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Many experimental techniques permit to characterize these influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Among them, the association of techniques controlling the Relative Humidity (hereafter RH), like the Dynamic Vapour Sorption (hereafter DVS), with the static vapour sorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the Infrared Spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> [12] <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or classical analyses as X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD hereafter), Thermogravimetric analyses associated to Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG-DSC hereafter) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are very helpful to understand solid-vapour equilibria. The present study aims at describing these equilibria through some examples treated in our laboratory. It intends also to prove that phase equilibria determination can be helpful during the industrial development of an organic solid. In particular, the use of DVS combined with other characterization techniques (XRPD at different relative humidity) permitted us to draw theoretical phase diagrams between water and drugs, and illustrated the importance of the storage atmosphere.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Dynamic Vapour Sorption</head><p>Water vapour sorption and desorption were carried out with an accurate humidity and temperature controlled microbalance system (Dynamic Vapour Sorption DVS-1 type, Surface Measurement System, UK). Relative humidity was controlled by continuous gas flow containing pure nitrogen and water vapour in adequate proportions. Temperature and RH were measured with a precision of 0.1°C and 0.5% respectively. Mass variations were recorded continuously with a precision of 0.1 μg. Isotherms were constructed with 10 consecutive steps of relative humidity between 0% and 90% RH at 20°C (0 to 90% during sorption, 90 to 0% during desorption). The mass measured at a given step was considered constant when relative mass variations dm/dt remained below 0.001% for 10 min. The maximum stabilization time was adjusted to 2000 minutes.</p></div>

The che mical nature of escaping gases during heating was identified by using a Netzsch QMS 403 C mass spectrometer coupled with the 449C TG/DSC apparatus. </p></div>

Three sets of exposures (1800 frames) were recorded, corresponding to three ω scans, for three different values of φ. The cell parameters and the orientation matrix of the crystal were preliminary determined by using SMART Software. Data integration and global cell refinement were performed with SAINT Software. Intensities were corrected for Lorentz, polarization, decay and absorption effects and reduced to Fo 2 . The program package SHELXTL was used for space group determination, structure solution and refinement. The space group was reliably determined from systematic extinctions and relative Fo 2 of equivalent reflections (XPREP). The structure was solved by direct methods (SHELXS).</p></div>

Gibb's phase rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> For a system in equilibrium, the Gibb's phase rule is suitable for thermodynamic interpretations of the hydrate formations. This rule gives the degree of freedom (or variance v) as a function of the number of: independent components C, physical variables N (temperature, pressure) and phases in presence φ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = C + N -φ</formula><p>(1) Variance represents the number of independent variables that must be fixed to establish the state of the system. In the following examples, studies were performed at fixed temperature (i.e. N= 1). Then, if we consider the formation of a hydrate under a certain RH (=</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">cst T sat O H O H P P = ) / ( 2 2</formula><p>), the following reaction is observed: A,nH2O (solid) + pH2O (vapour) A,(n+p)H2O (solid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Where A,nH2O (solid) and A,(n+p)H2O (solid) are two hydrates with n and n+p molecules of water per molecule of substrate (i.e. n=0 is the particular case of anhydrous). In this case, the number of independent components equals 2 (3 components linked by one relation), φ correspond to 1 (vapour phase) + φs (number of differentiable solid phases). Finally: <ref type="formula">3</ref>), two cases can be distinguished:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V= 2+1-φ = 3-φ = 2-φs (3) From equation (</formula><p>-The presence of two stoichiometric hydrates (A,nH2O (solid) and A,(n+p)H2O (solid) ) φs= 2, so V= 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Context</head><p>The first example chosen to illustrate the influence of RH on stability domains of successive hydrates is a pharmaceutical compound (DNCO hereafter). The solid has been characterized as a nonahydrate (SC-XRD) in water. Nevertheless, others hydrates with lower stoichiometries were suspected. As presented in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, batch n°1 was composed of nonahydrate phase only. Whereas, batch n°2 presented a lower water content (between 8 and 9 water molecules) and a different X-Ray pattern.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Compared XRPD patterns between DNCO, 9(H2O) calculated from the single crystal structure (a), DNCO batch 2 (b) and DNCO batch 1 (c). Ellipses show some differences in batch 2 compared to pure 9H2O.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Experiments</head><p>Starting from the pure nonahydrate solid phase, X-Ray Powder Diffraction analyses at variable temperature (associated to KF titrations and TGA-DSC) have highlighted 4 hydrates: the nonahydrate, a phase containing at circa 7 H2O that seemed to be non stoichiometric, a phase containing 4.5 H2O and finally a high temperature phase containing 1.2-1.5 molecules of water which exhibits two polymorphic forms. Based on these determinations, it was proved that batch n°2 was a mixture of hydrates that explains its lower water content compared to the pure nonahydrate.</p><p>In order to determine RH stability domains of DNCO hydrates at fixed temperature T=20°C, the combinati on between DVS and XRPD at variable RH was used. The DVS analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) presents the comparison of isotherms (T= 20°C) of sorption-desorption between the two batches (RH versus number of water molecules absorbed by the solid).</p><p>Remark: it was proved that the stoichiometry of batch 1 was 1/9 (DNCO/water in mol), so its stoichiometry was imposed to this batch at 50% RH. Moreover, because both batches exhibits the same water content at 0% RH, water stoichiometry of batch n°2 was then adjusted leadin g to an appropriate comparison between batches. The observation of DVS isotherm shows the presence of three domains of water stoichiometry (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Indeed, extreme RH (close to 0% and close to 90%) presented well defined stoichiometry (close to 4.5 water molecules and 9 water molecules respectively) and a third one (close to 7 H2O) could be present in the middle range of RH. (20 %&lt; RH&lt; 60%) In order to confirm these hypotheses, X-Ray powder diffraction analyses at variable RH were performed. Thus, batch 1 and 2 were conditioned in the diffractometer under three successive RH: 23%, 0% and 75%. For each of the three RH values, XRPD were performed during 15 hours in order to observe phase transitions. The latest patterns (for each RH) recorded for batch n°1 (as an example) are presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The results confirmed the domains proposed after DVS analyses. At 23% RH, a mixture between 9H2O and 7H2O is observed in both batches, but the patterns seemed to evolve toward the 7H2O phase over time. This non complete transition could be due to a low kinetic of phase transition in the solid state. At low RH values (close to 0%RH), the two batches collapse into the 4.5H2O phase. At high RH values, the batch n°1 was constituted by the nonahydrate, whereas the batch n°2 exhibits still a mixture between the 9H2O and the 7H2O, confirming the observations by using KF titration and XRPD analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Discussion</head><p>X-ray diffraction associated with DVS measurements have led to the characterization of several DNCO hydrates. Three domains of hydrates stability were identified at 20°C between 90% and 0% RH: 9H2O, 7H2O and 4.5H2O. These analyses could not permit to conclude on the stoichiometric character of these phases, especially for the 7H2O phase. The 1.2-1.5 hydrated phase did not appear accessible at this temperature. Thus, the influence of partial water (vapour) pressure on the DNCO hydrates is summarized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Moreover, a hypothetical binary diagram (at 20°C an d under atmospheric pressure) between DNCO, 4.5H2O and water could be proposed (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). According to the collected experimental information, the solid phase 7H2O was described as a putative non stoichiometric hydrate. This study led us to postulate some rationales to explain the differences in water content between batches. The best storage conditions could be also proposed in order to ensure the integrity of crystallized batches.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Experiments</head><p>Crystal structures of anhydrous phase and monohydrate of ciclopirox olamine (1:1) were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>). Both crystal structures present some similarities (space group and cell parameters), but no structural filiations were observed between the monohydrate and the anhydrous form. Indeed, a change of ciclopirox molecules orientations appeared during dehydration, inducing a destructive dehydration process. In order to understand the hydration mechanisms of this salt, sorption-desorption isotherms were collected by using DVS measurements at 20°C (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). During dehydration, a mass loss (7%) which is superior to the theoretical mass (6,2%) is observed. Moreover, the mass uptake related to the hydration of ciclopirox (1:1) under RH&gt;60 to 80% was decreasing during the successive sorption-desorption cycles (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). The non reproducibility of the mass uptake/loss during successive cycles indicates that there was, during the drying step, a simultaneous dehydration/degradation mechanism. In parallel, XRPD analyses carried out on product stored under drying condition after three sorption/desorption cycles have confirmed the evolution from the ciclopirox olamine (1:1) towards the (2:1) stoichiometry (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). This irreversible transformation in ambient conditions is due to the departure of a part of ethanolamine molecules (evaporated by the drying nitrogen flux). The kinetic of degradation appeared slow, explaining why a mixture between (1:1) salt and (2:1) salt is obtained (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). A cooperative departure of ethanolamine and water is thus observed during drying, which is likely to be due to a destructive reconstructive mechanism of dehydration.  </p></div>
