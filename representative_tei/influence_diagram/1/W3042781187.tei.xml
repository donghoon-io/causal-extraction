<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is widely known in the literature of cognitive science and economics that when it comes to decisionmaking under uncertainty, humans usually choose preferences that do not maximize the expected utility theory or that are inconsistent with the axioms of expected utility theory, leading to decisions that are either sub-optimal, paradoxical or even irrational <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. These paradoxical decisions can result in cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, violations of major economic principles (such as the Sure Thing Principle) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> or 1 Corresponding author address: catarina.pintomoreira@qut.edu.au violations to the laws of probability theory and logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. In short, decades of research has found a whole range of human judgements that deviates substantially from what would be considered normatively correct according to logic or probability theory. This fact raises a significant inconsistency: current decision support systems cannot easily accommodate sub-optimal or irrational human decisions, because they are usually built using generative learning algorithms, which are based on probability theory. Even in decision support systems based in neural networks, the goal is always to minimize a cost function and seek optimality <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. Hence, the normative framework for "right" decision-making in such decision support systems is the axioms of probability theory. When dealing with preferences under uncertainty, it seems that models based on normative theories of rational choice tend to tell how individuals must choose, instead of showing how individuals actually choose <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Models that could take into account, not only optimal rational decisions, but also sub-optimal, irrational and paradoxical human decisions could greatly benefit decision support systems, since there would be a better alignment between the system and the decision-maker. This alignment has the potential to provide more effective decision support systems by combining the advantages of rational and so called "irrational " decisions.</p><p>A simple solution to this problem would be to use rule-based expert systems and incorporate these cognitive biases and paradoxical decisions as rules. However, that would require an apriori understanding and identification of the cognitive biases involved, and would also lead to a set of rules growing largely with the size of the data, which is impractical. An alternative recommendation would be to rethink about the fundamental core concepts that underline generative decision models. If under uncertainty, humans make decisions that violate the laws of probability theory, then perhaps these laws are too limited to fully express human decision-making under uncertainty. A more general and flexible probability theory could provide better insights and accommodate several paradoxical findings reported in the literature without the need to know apriori, which cognitive biases the decision-maker is experiencing. One such general framework that has been extensively studied in the domain of human cognition is quantum probability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The Quantum-like Bayesian network <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> is an example of a model that is well established in the literature for predicting and accommodating paradoxical human decisions across different decision scenarios ranging from psychological experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> to real-world credit application scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The difference between the traditional Bayesian network (BN) and a quantum-like Bayesian Network (QLBN) is the way one specifies the values of the conditional probability tables. While in the traditional BNs, one uses real numbers to express probabilities, in quantum mechanics these probabilities are expressed as probability amplitudes, which are represented by complex numbers. These quantum amplitudes define the wave function, which describes the wave characteristics of a particle. The value of the wave function of a particle at a given point of space and time is related to the likelihood of the particle's being there at the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. To make probabilistic inferences in QLBNs, one needs to convert these quantum amplitudes into real probability values through a process of measurement, which mathematically speaking, corresponds to the squared magnitude of these amplitudes (this is known as Born's rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). In probabilistic inferences under uncertainty, where certain random variables are not observed, this measurement process will produce non-linear quantum interference terms that can attenuate the classical probabilities. Consequently, probabilistic laws such a the law of total probability may not hold, which has been used in the literature to provide a coherent explanation for paradoxes of human decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. It is important to note that traditional Bayesian networks can also accommodate all these paradoxical findings concerned with human data, however at the cost of adding latent variables, which are not clear about what they represent in terms of the decision-maker's belief space and also lead to an exponential increase of the full joint probability distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, quantum-like models are merely probabilistic and they cannot be used in decision-making settings, since decision-making implies the notion of utility. For instance, it is not enough for a doctor to know the probability of a patient having some disease. Rather, a doctor needs to act upon this information and decide what will be the best drug for the patient. At the heart of such a decision is the need to maximize the utility of the decision, which in this case equates to the decision that best promotes the well being of the patient. Since current decision-making systems are based on classical probability theory, then they cannot capture and predict human paradoxical decisions, and instead of accommodating these deviations in human behaviour in the model, they are usually ignored and labelled as simply irrational, with the implication that they are "wrong".</p><p>In this sense, this paper aims to put together a comprehensive framework on how to describe the probabilistic nature of the human decision-making process with a focus on modelling optimal, sub-optimal and irrational (paradoxical) human decisions by extending the previously proposed quantum-like Bayesian network <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> to incorporate the notion of maximum expected utility. What distinguishes this work from the literature is the following: instead of proposing an alternative representation of the expected utility theory (like it is done in Mura <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>), we retain expected utility as it is commonly understood, but we take advantage of the quantum interference terms produced in the quantum-like Bayesian Network to influence the probabilities used to compute the expected utility of some decision. In this way, we are not hypothe-sizing a new type of expected utility. On the contrary, we propose incorporate standard expected utility as an extension of a probabilistic graphical model in the form of a compact graphical representation called an "influence diagram", which is simply a general graphical representation of the expected utility theory.</p><p>The main difference is that instead of the utility function depending on classical probabilities, it will be influenced by probabilistic inferences computed by the quantum-like Bayesian network. Influence diagrams are probabilistic graphical models for decision-making that are widely used in the literature (for instance, in finance to determine the net present value of a project <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, in economics to model antitrust enforcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> or even in medical decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>).</p><p>In this article, the utility-based influence diagram framework will be used to naturally explain the paradoxical findings of the prisoner dilemma game in regard to the expected utilities of the players. It is important to note that this research is not concerned with modelling the brain with quantum theory, nor is directly concerned with the idea that brain is a quantum computer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Instead, our model assumes that quantum wave functions are present in the macroscopic world, like it has been confirmed in a variety of scientific studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>). However, if such architecture had to be implemented, one can assume that the proposed quantum-like influence diagram is a theoretical assembly model that explains how stimuli represented by assemblies of neurons can be propagated during the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This notion is inspired by the neural assembly theory introduced by Hebb <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, where the author proposed a connection between the structures found in the nervous system and those involved in high-level cognition such as diagnostic problem solving. In our model an assembly may be in four states: 1) not activated since it is not working, 2) positively activated, 3) negative activated or 4) in a superposition state that is neither, positively activated or negatively activated. The connections between the assemblies correspond to the conditional probability values and are represented under the framework of probabilistic graphical models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background and Fundamental Concepts</head><p>The model proposed in this work is founded on probabilistic graphical models, namely on Bayesian networks, which are one of the most powerful structures known by the Computer Science community for deriving probabilistic inferences (for instance, in medical diagnosis, spam filtering, image segmentation, etc) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The main advantage of these models is that they provide a link between probability theory and graph theory. And a fundamental property of graph theory is its modularity: one can build a complex system by combining smaller and simpler parts. Computationally, it is easier to combine different pieces of evidence and to perform probabilistic inferences, instead of calculating all possible events and their</p></div>

In the same way, Bayesian Networks represent the decision problem in small modules that can be combined to perform inferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Only the probabilities which are actually needed to perform the inferences are computed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This process can also be viewed under the perspective of human cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. During the inference process, the decision-makers cannot process all possible information of the decision problem, and consequently, they combine several smaller pieces of evidence (or information) together with uncertainty about the decision problem in order to reach a final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. This lack of information can be translated into the feelings of ambiguity, uncertainty, vagueness, risk, ignorance, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, and they are a consequence of various factors, such as limitations in their ability to observe the world, limitations in their ability to model it and possibly even because of innate nondeterminism <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.  Under a classical point of view, uncertainty is represented by classical probability theory, where the decision-maker is assumed to be experiencing a definite state in each time period. Under a quantum probabilistic perspective, this representation of uncertainty is different. When reasoning under uncertainty, the decision-maker is in an indefinite state, which results in a superposition of beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A superposition can be generally understood as the simultaneous occurrence of all the beliefs that the decision-maker is experiencing in a single time frame. This superposition of beliefs will result in the occurrence of quantum interference effects that under high levels of uncertainty can disturb the decision-maker's beliefs. One can look at quantum interference effects as waves that crash between each other, leading to waves (beliefs) that are destroyed (destructive interference) and waves that can be reinforced (constructive interference). This phenomena of quantum interference is also the core of quantum computation and the reason why such computers can achieve such high performances in terms of speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows an example of the role of quantum interference effects within unobserved nodes in Bayesian networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Fundamental Concepts in Rationality and Decision-Making under the Quantum-Like Approach</head><p>The main goal of the proposed quantum-like influence diagrams is to provide a unifying decision model for data-driven computational decisions, which are based on optimization algorithms, and for human datadriven decisions, which are susceptible to cognitive biases. Under this framework, one can define different viewpoints on the notion of rationality, depending on the degrees of rationality that the decision-maker can experience. The views presented under the proposed quantum-like approach are similar to the one put forward by Gigerenzer and Goldstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. They include decisions bounded in terms of time, processing power, information, etc. We extend this view to incorporate the notion of the irrational mind, a point in the decision-maker's belief space where heuristics are no longer sufficient to produce satisficing outcomes.</p><p>Under the proposed quantum-like approach, we define the different views on rationality in the following way <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> provides an illustration of these views.</p><p>• Belief space: Corresponds to the set of possible beliefs that are held by a decision-maker from the moment that (s)he is faced with a decision until (s)he actually makes the decision. Beliefs as inputs of thought, and desires as motivational sources of reasoning, guide decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>• Unbounded Rationality: Corresponds to the ideal scenario where the decision-maker has unlimited cognitive resources: time, processing power and information in order to transact the decision. Note that the ideal scenario is often not within reach for a human decision-maker. Computationally, this corresponds to the Maximum Expected Utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, Bayes rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, likelihood maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>,</p><p>rules of Logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, etc.</p><p>• Bounded Rationality: Corresponds to the scenario where the decision-maker makes decisions bounded in terms of cognitive resources with limited information, time, and processing power. Consequently, fast and frugal heuristics are applied sometimes resulting in sub-optimal decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but also yielding good-enough adaptive decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, i.e. favourable in terms of meeting desires satisfactorily without creating illogical or improbable conclusions. Fast and frugal heuristics, by their definition, are not produced by strictly logical or probabilistic calculations, but equally they do not violate logical or probabilistic principles.</p><p>• Irrationality: Corresponds to the situation where bounded rationality can no longer apply fast and frugal heuristics that satisfy the desires due to extreme levels of uncertainty or due to the inability J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f</p><p>Journal Pre-proof of the decision-maker to make adequate decisions. These decisions generally have poor utility and performances. The fast and frugal heuristics start to fail, and the decision-maker experiences cognitive dissonance effects and starts to violate rules of logic and probability, which in turn leads to unfavourable heuristics and their paradoxical and irrational outcomes. These decisions are hard (or even impossible) to be captured by current computational decision systems.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Views on rationality under the proposed quantum-like approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Bayesian Networks</head><p>A Bayesian Network (BN) is a directed acyclic graph in which each node represents a random variable, and each edge represents a direct influence from the source node to the target node. The graph represents independence relationships between variables, and each node is associated with a conditional probability table that specifies a distribution over the values of a node given each possible joint assignment of values of its parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian networks can represent essentially any full joint probability distribution, which can be computed using the chain rule for Bayesian networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.

Setting the angles to right angles means that all cosine similarities are either 0 or 1, transforming a continuous-valued system to a Booleanvalued system.

As shown in Vedral <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, although we are in a full newtonian world, there is growing evidence that the wave function and other quantum effects can manifest in the macroscopic world (see Amico et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). For instance, European robins are little birds that have some particles in their eyes that in interact ant and become entangled with Earth's magnetic field, allowing the birds to have a compass for their migration route <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>The current work takes a similar position. We assume that decision-makers (either people within human cognitive tasks, or machines in general decision-making problems) can be affected by the wave function while reasoning in decision-scenarios with high levels of uncertainty. This wave function can provide interference effects in different levels, and lead to deviations from normative probabilistic inferences. This is why we refer to the model as quantum-like, instead of a pure quantum system that would require a microscopic, particle world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Setting Interference Terms: The Law of Balance</head><p>So far, we presented a general model, which allows different levels of probabilistic reasoning in decision scenarios, ranging from normative and rational inferences, to sub-optimal, or even irrational, inferences. In this section, we will address the hard problem of how to find the right quantum interference terms that can express the different types of human decisions, namely optimal rational decisions, sub-optimal decisions and irrational decisions. In the recent works of Moreira and Wichert <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and Wichert and Moreira <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>,</p><p>the authors proposed two methods to automatically set quantum interference terms to accommodate and predict human paradoxical decisions. These methods are the dynamic similarity heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and the law of balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Both methods seemed to be specially effective in predicting violations of the Sure Thing Principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>, although some recent studies show a potential application of the dynamic similarity heuristic within a real-world credit application problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">The Similarity Heuristic</head><p>In the Similarity Heuristic, the interference parameters θ are obtained by extracting the similarity values between the marginal distribution vectors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). This is achieved by computing the cosine similarity between them, which is a widely used similarity function in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The cosine similarity will provide three degrees of similarity between the belief vectors during the inference process and will allow the extraction of information that can be used to compute the quantum interference terms.</p><p>For details on how to compute the similarity heuristic, the reader can refer to the original work from Moreira and Wichert <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> for more theoretical and technical clarifications. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">The Law of Balance</head><p>One important element in quantum-like Bayesian networks is concerned with the normalisation factor that is used during probabilistic inference. While in traditional Bayesian networks this normalisation factor derives from the notions of conditional independence and Bayes rule, within a quantum-like formalism this is not clear since the quantum interference terms are also present in the normalisation process. This turns the representation of the quantum waves skewed and more sensitive to changes in the quantum interference terms.</p><p>In Wichert and Moreira <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, the authors proposed a balanced quantum-like Bayesian network in which the normalisation process occurs by taking dominant quantum interference waves and balancing them in such a way that, when Bayes normalisation is begin applied upon probabilistic inferences, they cancel each other out. This notion of balancing the quantum interference waves is represented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>,</p><p>where one can see that a dominant and an under representative quantum interference wave are balanced  and are modelled in a way that allows them to fluctuate around their classical predictions. The quantum interference is predicted by choosing the wave that has leads to the highest uncertainty, in other words, the wave that has the highest entropy.

The different quantum interference terms can show higher probabilities of the player making a fully rational decision, a sub-optimal decision and a total irrational decision. comes found in different experiments of the literature with respect to the Prisoner's dilemma game, while classical probability inference was not. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> also shows that, the similarity heuristic was able to perform good approximations to the data. However, due to the normalisation of the waves, these waves become skewed and the quantum interference parameters become very sensitive to small changes, leading to overestimations and underestimations in the prediction of the probability values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>). That is, a small change in a quantum interference parameter will lead to a completely different probability value, which resembles the notion of deterministic chaos, where small differences in initial conditions yield widely diverging outcomes in a system.</p><p>With the law of balance on the hand, we observe a different scenario. Since the interference of the waves cancel each other during Bayesian inference, then these waves are not skewed and they provide a more uniform distribution for the quantum interference terms, which makes them less susceptible for the problems caused by deterministic chaos (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>). However, in terms of fitting the experimental findings in the literature, their performance is slightly drops.</p><p>In terms of the probabilistic inferences of the quantum-like Bayesian network, it seems that quantum interference effects can accommodate and predict the irrational decisions of the decision-maker. However, in terms of decision-making, probability distributions are not enough. In medical decision-making, for instance, it is not enough for a doctor to know the probability of a patient having a disease. The doctor needs to take action, based on this uncertainty and see which treatments would be the best for the patient (treatments that maximize the utility of the patient). In this sense, in the next section, we analyse the maximum expected utility within the quantum-like paradigm, where the utilities of the player are influenced by quantum interference effects.</p></div>

The utilities that the decision-maker can obtain within this framework are also depicted in the diagram in the right. This diagram shows that there are some regions, where the decision-maker perceives a higher utility by choosing to Cooperate, rather than to Defect.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">17</ref> shows the evolution of the decision-maker's beliefs in the experiment conducted by Tversky and Shafir <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. In this figure, one can see the following:</p><p>• Fully classical decisions: the majority of the decision-makers are stable in the regions of the belief space where the MEU of defect is maximised. This notion is in accordance with predictions from expected utility theory and concepts from Game Theory, where in strictly dominant strategies, the decision-maker stays stable in the Nash equilibrium state, in this case, engaging in a defect strategy. In this region, it seems that the decision-maker is not experiencing much uncertainty, and consequently quantum interference effects are minimum. Journal Pre-proof interference effects are not strong enough to make the decision-maker change his mind and for that reason they continue to choose according to expected utility.</p><p>• Irrational decisions: correspond to the central, blue regions of the figure. In these regions, uncertainty is maximised and quantum interference effects are significant enough to make the decisionmaker change his mind. It is in this region where the decision-maker perceives that MEU (Cooperate) &gt; MEU ect), and consequently is making a decision that deviates from the classical notions of the Expected Utility theory. Notions of game theory actually accept the fact that the decision-maker might not always obey to the formalisms of expected utility theory and be irrational. This might be when players did not understand the rules of the game, or simply because they played randomly. What game theory notions tell us is that the decision-maker will not stay stable in these irrational states. That is exactly what Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">17</ref> shows. Although some decision-makers perceive that to Cooperate is the best action, they do not stay stable in that state.</p><p>The same analysis was done, but this time, using the law of balance as a normalisation procedure (Fig-   It is important to note that this research is not concerned with the brain with quantum theory, nor is directly concerned with the idea that brain is a quantum computer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Instead, our model assumes that quantum wave functions are present in the macroscopic world, like it has been confirmed in a variety of scientific studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>). However, if such architecture had to be implemented, one can assume that the proposed quantum-like influence diagram is a theoretical assembly model that explains how stimuli represented by assemblies of neurons can be propagated during the decision process. In this model, we assume that the cell of assemblies of a Neural Network act in the same way as graph, where each cell assembly of a neuron corresponds to a node, and the connection between the assemblies correspond to the links that represent conditional probabilities. If a cell neither fires nor has a negative influence firing through inhibitory connections, it is assumed that the cell is in a kind of superposition. Consequently, the law of total probability attenuated by an interference term is applied. This notion is inspired by the neural assembly theory introduced by Donald Hebb <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. He proposed a connection between the structures found in the nervous system and those involved in high-level cognition such as diagnostic problem solving. An assembly of neurons acts as a closed system, and can therefore represent a complex object. Activation of some neurons of the assembly leads to the activation of the entire assembly, so that manipulations on the representation of a complex object are performed <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>. Our model is a theoretical assembly model that explains how stimuli represented by assemblies can be propagated during the decision making process. In our model an assembly may be in four states: 1) not activated since it is not working, 2) positively activated, 3) negative activated or 4) in a superposition state that is neither, positively activated or negatively activated. The connections between the assemblies correspond to the conditional probability values and are represented under the framework of probabilistic graphical models.</p></div>

This work is motivated by the fact that, when dealing with preferences under uncertainty, it seems that models based on normative theories of rational choice tend to tell how individuals must choose, instead of telling how individuals actually choose <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Journal Pre-proof</head><p>We propose a new comprehensive framework on how to describe the probabilistic nature of the human decision-making process with focus on modelling paradoxical, sub-optimal and irrational human decisions by extending the quantum-like Bayesian network formalism to incorporate the notion of maximum expected utility through the notion of quantum-like influence diagrams. In this model, instead of proposing an alternative representation of the expected utility theory, we retain expected utility as it is commonly understood, but we take advantage of the quantum interference terms produced in the quantum-like Bayesian Network to influence the probabilities used to the expected utility of some action.</p><p>Experimental results showed that the proposed model is able to (1) accommodate the different paradoxical findings reported in different experiments of the literature, through the quantum-like probabilistic inferences of the quantum-like Bayesian network, (2) augment the decision-making system by capturing human decisions that are considered paradoxical, and therefore classified as irrational, by using quantum interference to quantify the decision-maker's uncertainty; This quantum interference can provide us new insights from the decision-maker's belief space and help understand in which regions in this space, the decision-maker perceives that choosing the irrational decision would give him a higher maximum expected utility, and (3) be able to study the evolution of the decision-maker's belief within his belief space, through quantum interference.</p><p>We believe that this model can be a foundation for new decision support systems that are able to quantify human uncertainty and ambiguity under a quantum-like mathematical framework. The initial results are very promising, and they suggest the potential of new insights decision science with direct implications in decision support systems that deal with human data, such as economics, finance, psychology, etc. A promising path includes models for social-ecological systems, such as participatory Bayesian networks that explore ambiguity among stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, that try to promote decision models for a more sustainable activities.</p></div>

The prisoner's dilemma is an example where, under uncertainty, people violate the sure thing principle, by being more cooperative in decisions under uncertainty. The prisoner's dilemma game can be summarised as follows. There are two prisoners who are in separate solitary confinements with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police offer each prisoner an agreement: each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other (Defect), by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to Cooperate with the other by remaining silent.
