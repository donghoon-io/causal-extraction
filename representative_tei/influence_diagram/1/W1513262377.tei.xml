<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTODUCTION</head><p>These last decades knew intense political and economic changes which increases the uncertainty lied to real problems and makes decision making a very delicate task. In this context, graphical decision models allow a compact and a simple representation of decision problems. Within most popular decision models, we can mention decision trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, influence diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and valuation based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we are interested, in particular, in influence diagrams (IDs) which provide efficient decision tools under uncertainty. An ID is composed by a graphical component which is a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and a numerical one quantifying this DAG. The numerical component is generally provided by experts who will express their uncertainty relative to variables (represented by chance nodes) via probability distributions and their preferences (represented by value nodes) through utilities. Nevertheless, in most real problems it is not obvious to provide exact probability distributions and it is easier to express uncertainty in a qualitative manner. Moreover, decision makers (DM) may encounter several difficulties when expressing their utilities.</p><p>We have already attacked these problems by proposing what we have called possibilistic influence diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> [8] <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> which are possibilistic counterpart of standard influence diagrams where the numerical component is modeled in the possibilistic framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which offers an alternative choice to the probabilistic one with a particular ability to handle uncertain information in a qualitative manner.</p><p>In this paper, we propose another variant of possibilistic influence diagrams considering the case of several expert opinions in order to improve the quality of utilities. More precisely, we develop the case where an initial expert will propose a set of possible numerical utilities and a possibility distribution relative to each consequence and each utility. Then, a group of assistant experts will help him by providing, in their turn, their opinion regarding the same elements. Then, the initial expert will express his opinion concerning the reliability of assistant experts by assigning confidence degrees to each of them. In addition, he should provide a similarity threshold which will be taken into account in the evaluation process. In fact, only possibility distributions with similarity measure higher than the fixed threshold will be considered. Then, the conjunction between possibility distributions relative to each utility and each consequence will be computed in order to obtain one possibility distribution.</p><p>Once this step achieved, we will have a possibilistic influence diagram quantified in the same way than those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> which means that the already developed evaluation method can be used in order to generate best strategies.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the necessary background on possibility theory. Section 3 presents possibilistic influence diagrams. Section 4 proposes the new variant of possibilistic influence diagrams involving several experts. Finally, Section 5 details the evaluation algorithm of multi-source possibilistic influence diagrams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND ON POSSIBILITY THEORY</head><p>Possibility theory was proposed as an alternative theory of uncertainty in order to remedy the incapacity of probability theory for modeling total ignorance and qualitative uncertainty. This theory was initially proposed by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> and was developed by Dubois and Prade <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This section briefly recalls basic elements of possibility theory, for more details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The basic buildings block in the possibility theory is the notion of possibility distribution denoted by π, it is a mapping from the universe of discourse denoted by Ω = {ω 1 ...ω n } to the unit interval [0, 1]. This scale has two interpretations, a quantitative one when the handled values have a real sense and a qualitative one when the handled values reflect only an ordering between the different states of the world.</p><p>In the possibilistic framework, extreme forms of partial knowledge can be represented by complete knowledge i.e. ∃ω i ∈ Ω, s.t π(ω i ) = 1 and ω j = ω i , π(ω j ) = 0 and the total ignorance i.e. ∀ω i ∈ Ω, π(ω i ) = 1.</p><p>A possibility degree is a value from the interval [0, 1] associated to each element ω of Ω. The possibility measure of any subset ψ ⊆ Ω is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Π(ψ) = max ω∈ψ π(ω)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Π has a dual measure which is the necessity measure A possibility distribution is said to be normalized, if max ω∈ψ π(ω) = 1 (Namely, ω is a totally possible state) and it is said to be sub-normalized if max ω∈ψ π(ω) = 1.</p><p>The value 1max ω∈ψ π(ω) is called the degree of inconsistency of a possibility distribution and it is commonly used to measure the level of conflict in information issued from multiple sources after merging them.</p><p>Namely, if 1-max ω∈ψ (π 1 (ω)∧π 2 (ω)) = 0 then π 1 ∧ π 2 is a sub-normalized possibility distribution and there is a conflict between π 1 and π 2 .</p><p>Given two possibility distributions from two distinct sources of information, then it is possible to compute the similarity between these two sources through a similarity measure between the two possibility distributions. In the literature, several similarity measures have been proposed such as Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance which satisfy basic properties of any possibilistic similarity measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In the possibilistic approach, there are several combination modes to ensure the information fusion and the choice of the appropriate method is related to the reliability of information's sources.</p><p>The most known combination operators are the symmetric ones, namely the conjunctive and the disjunctive operators:</p><p>1) The conjunctive fusion: If all sources are reliable, then we can combine them using the intersection, the conjunctive operator is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∀ ω ∈ Ω, π ∧ (ω) = i=1..n π i (ω)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where π i be the possibility distribution supplied by source i. is a t-norms such that minimum or product or linear product according to the uncertainty scale's interpretation. Indeed, the min operator is supported by both quantitative and qualitative possibility distributions. However, the use of the product operator assumes that possibility degrees are numerical.</p><p>2) The disjunctive fusion: This mode of combination is applied when it is known for sure that at least one of the sources is reliable but it is not known which one. The disjunctive operator is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∀ ω ∈ Ω, π ∨ (ω) = i=1..n π i (ω)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>is a t-conorms such that maximum or probabilistic sum or Lukasievicz according to the uncertainty scale's interpretation. Indeed, all of these t-conorms can be applied in the quantitative setting. However, only the maximum operator can be applied in the qualitative setting. The conditioning represents a special case of information fusion. Indeed, it consists in revising our initial knowledge, represented by a possibility distribution π, which will be changed into another possibility distribution π = π(.|ψ) with ψ = ∅ and Π(ψ) &gt; 0.</p><p>The two interpretations of the possibilistic scale induce two definitions of the conditioning:</p><p>• Min-based conditioning relative to the ordinal setting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">π(ω|mψ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 if π(ω) = Π(ψ) and ω ∈ ψ π(ω) if π(ω) &lt; Π(ψ) and ω ∈ ψ 0 otherwise<label>(4)</label></formula><p>• Product-based conditioning relative to the numerical setting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">π(ω|pψ) = π(ω) Π(ω) if ω ∈ ψ 0 otherwise<label>(5)</label></formula><p>III. POSSIBILISTIC INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS Few works exist on possibilistic networks and existing ones concern reasoning under uncertainty without considering the decision aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, Sabbadin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have proposed possibilistic influence diagrams using optimistic and pessimistic utilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for the quantification of value nodes. Giang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> noted that this utility framework is based on axioms relative to uncertainty attitude contrary to the VNM axiomatic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> based on risk attitude, which does not make a sense in the possibilistic framework since it represents uncertainty rather than risk. Moreover, to use pessimistic and optimistic utilities, the decision maker should classify himself as either pessimistic or optimistic which is not always obvious. To overcome these limitations, Giang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> propose a more generalized framework based on the axiomatic system of possibilistic binary utility.</p><p>The theory of possibility offers a rich and effective framework for the representation and the treatment of the uncertainty, what motivated us to develop possiblistic influence diagrams which benefit also of the simplicity of standard influence diagrams.</p><p>Formally, a possibilistic IDs has two components: 1) A graphical component defined by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), denoted by G(N, A), where N is the set of chance, decision and value nodes and A is the set of arcs in the directed graph. 2) A numerical component evaluating different dependencies between chance nodes and utilities for value nodes.</p><p>• For each chance node C i , we should provide conditional possibility degree</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Π(c ij | pa(C i )) of each instance c ij of C i in the context</formula><p>of each instance of its parents. In order to satisfy the normalization constraint, these conditional distributions should satisfy, ∀pa(C i ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">max cij Π(c ij | pa(C i )) = 1,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Note that for root chance nodes (i.e. (P a(C i ) = ∅), equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) corresponds to max cij Π(c ij ) = 1. • For each value node V i , there are several ways to represent decision maker's preferences on the set of consequences, namely using cardinal utility, ordinal utility, possibilistic utility or as well as a compound utility.</p><p>Note that likewise standard IDs, decision nodes in possibilistic IDs are not quantified. Different combinations between the quantification of chance and utility nodes offer several kinds of possibilistic IDs which can be regrouped into three principal classes: In a previous study, we have developed min-based possibilistic IDs where for the quantification of value nodes, we have handled two cases: the first one concerns the use of the ordinal utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the second <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is about the application of the qualitative binary possibilistic utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we have developed product-based possibilistic IDs where for the quantification of value nodes, we have handled two cases: the first one concerns the use of cardinal utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the second one treat the case where decision makers provide a set of numerical utilities and a possibility distribution relative to each consequence and each utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The chain rule relative to product-based possibilistic IDs is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Π(C | D) = Π Ci∈C π(C i | P a(C i ))</formula><p>To evaluate these possibilistic IDs, we have proposed an indirect evaluation method, in which we have used the information fusion in the possibilistic framework. In fact, the product operator was used for the conjunction and the max operator was used for the disjunction. This paper proposes an extension of these IDs to the case of several experts as detailed in next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MULTI-SOURCE POSSIBILISTIC INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS</head><p>The new variant of possibilistic IDs proposed in this paper deals with the case of several experts that will collaborate for the quantification of value nodes. Indeed, in these IDs dependencies between chance nodes will be expressed by quantitative possibility distributions and value nodes are quantified by several experts.</p><p>In fact, an initial expert E 0 and n assistant experts (E i where i ∈ {1..n}) will model their uncertainty relative to each value node.</p><p>More precisely, the initial expert will provide a set of m numerical utilities, denoted by UT and also a possibility distribution relative to each utility and each consequence (without affecting the exact value of utility to the appropriate consequence). Then, assistant experts will help initial expert to improve the accuracy of his knowledge concerning value nodes and they will provide, in their terms, possibility distributions relative to each utility and each consequence.</p><p>The possibility distribution provided by the initial expert will be denoted by Π 0 , and the one expressed by the assistant expert E i by Π i . These possibility distributions should satisfy, ∀x ∈ X:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max UTj ∈UT Π i (U (x) = UT j ) = 1 ∀i ∈ {0..n} (7)</formula><p>To avoid unreliable opinions and possible contradictory knowledge, the initial expert will assign a confidence degree to each assistant expert. These degrees reflect the confidence of the initial expert in each assistant expert. The confidence degree relative to the assistant expert E i is denoted by α i such that α i ∈ [0, 1]. We can distinguish the following different cases concerning α i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• if α i = 0 then E 0 has no confidence in E i . • if α i = 1 then E 0 has a total confidence in E i . • if α i = 0.5 then E 0 is neutral concerning E i . • if α i ∈]0, 0.5[ then E 0 isn't confident in E i . • if α i ∈]0.5, 1[ then E 0 is confident in E i .</formula><p>In addition, the initial expert will fix a similarity threshold (denoted by T H), beyond it possibility distributions are considered in contradiction with his knowledge. T H ∈ [0, 1].</p><p>According to the value of T H, we can classify the behavior of the initial expert as follows:</p><p>• if T H = 0 then E 0 has a pessimistic behavior characterized by uncertainty aversion.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">• if T H = 1 then E 0 has</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">A Π(A) A B Π(B|A) B C Π(C|B) T 1 T T 0.9 T T 1 F 0.6 F T 0.2 F T 0.3 T F 1 T F 0.2 F F 1 F F 1</formula><p>For the utilities, the initial expert affirms that the possible values of utilities are {4, 7, 8}.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity we will denote (U (A, D) = 4) by U 1 , (U (A, D) = 7) by U 2 and (U (A, D) = 8) by U 3 .</p><p>The initial possibility distribution Π 0 relative to each consequence and utility provided by the initial expert is represented in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">II</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(U (A, D) = UT i ) A D Π 0 (U 1 ) Π 0 (U 2 ) Π 0 (U 3 ) T d 1 0.2 1 0.3 F d 1 1 0.1 0.2 T d 2 0.6 0.1 1 F d 2 1 0.1 0.3</formula><p>To improve the precision of his uncertainty concerning the utilities, the initial expert will take into account the opinion of two other assistant experts (E 1 and E 2 ) who will provide possibility distributions Π 1 and Π 2 represented respectively in tables III and IV.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">TABLE III POSSIBILITY DISTRIBUTION Π 1 (U (A, D) = UT i ) A D Π 1 (U 1 ) Π 1 (U 2 ) Π 1 (U 3 ) T d 1 0.1 0.6 1 F d 1 1 0.4 0.8 T d 2 0.5 0.5 1 F d 2 1 0.1 0.3 TABLE IV POSSIBILITY DISTRIBUTION Π 2 (U (A, D) = UT i ) A D Π 2 (U 1 ) Π 2 (U 2 ) Π 2 (U 3 ) T d 1 0.2 0.9 1 F d 1 0.7 1 0.2 T d 2 0.6 0.3 1 F d 2 1 0.1 0.3</formula><p>Suppose that the confidence degrees relative to assistant experts E 1 and E 2 are α 1 = 0.7 and α 2 = 0.3 which means that E 0 has a confidence in E 1 and not in E 2 ) and that the similarity threshold fixed by the initial expert is T H = 0.3 i.e. he has a pessimistic behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EVALUATION OF MULTI-SOURCE POSSIBILISTIC INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS</head><p>Given a multi-source possibilistic ID, we should evaluate it in order to generate optimal decisions. As we have mentioned in the introduction, there are two approaches to evaluate standard IDs, namely, direct and indirect ones.</p><p>The evaluation of possibilistic IDs, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, is based on an indirect evaluation method which transforms them into decision trees. Such evaluation method was not successful in the probabilistic framework since, contrary to those based on Bayesian networks, it does not use independencies encoded by IDs to save some computations since decision trees are not able to represent independencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. This argument remains available in the possibilistic framework, as it only concerns the graphical component which is the same in the two frameworks.</p><p>In addition, direct evaluation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> require heavy computations since they are based on arc reversal and node deletion, contrary to indirect ones which are based on the transformation of IDs into Bayesian networks. This explains the great development of indirect methods in the probabilistic case <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The success of indirect evaluation methods for standard IDs, motivates us to develop an indirect evaluation method for possibilistic IDs. Our choice is reinforced by the fact that a possibilistic counterpart of Bayesian networks has been developed as well as their propagation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>More precisely, we will develop a possibilistic counterpart of Cooper's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for the particular case of influence diagram with a unique value node, since it represents the basis of existing indirect methods.</p><p>Thus, the principle of our evaluation algorithm is to transform decision and value nodes into chance nodes in order to obtain a possibilistic network, and then to use this secondary structure to compute maximal expected utilities via a propagation process. These two major phases are detailed in what follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Transformation phase</head><p>This phase consists in transforming decision and value nodes into chance nodes.</p><p>1) Decision nodes transformation : Each decision node D i in the possibilistic ID is transformed into a chance node which should be quantified. In the probabilistic case, this quantification is ensured by an equi-probable distribution. Nevertheless, this is not really appropriate, since equi-probability represents randomness rather than total ignorance. This problem can be overcome in the possibilistic framework where our ignorance about the new chance node can be suitably represented via a uniform possibility distribution. More formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Π(d ij | p pa(D i )) = 1, ∀d ij , pa(D i )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Example 2: The ID presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> has one decision node D. The possibility distribution of the new chance node D obtained by equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. is presented in table V:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">TABLE V POSSIBILITY DISTRIBUTION Π(D | C) C D Π(D | C) T d 1 1 F d 2 1 T d 2 1 F d 1<label>1</label></formula><p>2) Value node transformation : This phase starts by a processing step of possibility distributions given by several experts. The goal of this step is to consider only reliable opinions of assistant experts in order to avoid contradiction in knowledge. This processing step is detailed as follows:</p><p>1) For each E i (i ∈ 1..n), compute the similarity between the initial possibility distribution Π 0 and his possibility distribution Π i . This similarity measure will be denoted by S i (Π 0 , Π i ) and can be computed by any quantitative similarity measure between two possibility distributions (see section 2). Let s ij be the similarity measure between Π 0 and Π i for the case of UT j (j ∈ 1..m). Then, the similarity measure S i (Π 0 , Π i ) will be the average of the all s ij i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">S i (Π 0 , Π i ) = m j=1 s ij m .</formula><p>2) For each S i (i ∈ 1..n), compute the weighted similarity measure i.e. This step aims to balance the similarity measure taking into account the confidence degree of the assistant expert.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">S i = α i * S i .</formula><p>3) Eliminate opinions whose relative weighted similarity measure are lower than the similarity threshold. Namely, possibility distributions Π i whose S (Π 0 , Π i ) &lt; TH will be eliminated. 4) Combine reserved possibility distribution Π i with Π 0 using the min operator since it concerns a conjunctive fusion in quantitative setting. The resulted possibility distribution will be denoted by Π r . After this processing step, we will have a possibilistic influence diagram quantified in the same way that those yet developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, so that the proposed value node transformation method can be directly applied.</p><p>Example 3: Let us continue with the same example. To measure the similarity between proposed possibility distributions, we will use the Manhattan Distance MD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">MD(Π 1 , Π2) = 1 - n i=1 (|π 1 (ω i ) -π 2 (ω i )|)</formula><p>n Let S 1 (resp. S 2 ) be the similarity measure between Π 0 and Π 1 (resp. Π 0 and Π 2 ). Then for the computation of S 1 , we have: Since T H = 0.3, then only the opinion of E 1 will be taken into account for the quantification phase Once, this processing step is achieved, the conjunction of Π 0 with the reserved possibility distribution Π 1 will be computed using the min operator as shown in table VI. To compute optimal strategy, the proposed algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> dealing with possibilistic influence diagrams using information fusion will be used. The obtained possibilistic network after the transformation of the decision node D and the value node V is presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.</p><p>The first step for the transformation of the value node V in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is the transformation of numerical utilities into a possibility distribution as presented in table VII.  Each consequence has two information: Π(V |A, D) and Π r (U i ) ∀i ∈ {1, 2, 3} which will be merged using the product operator. The result of this conjunctive fusion is Π Vi presented in table VIII.</p></div>

For each consequence, the disjunctive fusion will be applied via the max operator. The possibility distribution issued by the disjunctive fusion is presented in table IX.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Propagation phase</head><p>The following step in the evaluation process of the possibilistic influence diagram is the propagation phase which consists in the use of the appropriate propagation algorithm in the possibilistic network issued from the transformation phase. The selection of the appropriate propagation algorithm depends of the DAG structure. The propagation phase aims to compute the Maximal Expected Utility (MEU) relative to each decision node. This computation starts by the last decision node D m to the first one D 1 . Optimal decisions (i.e those relative to D 1 , .., D i-1 ) already computed should be integrated in the computation of the optimal decision relative to D i . More formally, for each decision D i , we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Π(D i , E) = Π(v = T | P a(V ))Π(P a (V ) | d ij , E) (9)</formula><p>where E is the set of evidence and P a (V ) is the set of chance nodes in P a(V ).</p><p>For the proposed possibilistic influence diagrams, we will always obtain a quantitative possibilistic networks, so productbased propagation algorithms in quantitative possibilistic networks should be used in order to compute Π(P a (V ) |d ij , E) .</p><p>Indeed, two product-based propagation algorithms have been defined according to the nature of the DAG in the possibilistic network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we have proposed a new extension of possibilistic influence diagrams where several source of information regarding value nodes are available.</p><p>Indeed, dependencies between chance nodes are quantified using possibility distributions. Then, an initial expert should define for each value node a set of possible numerical utilities and possibility distributions relative to each consequence and each utility. Then, several assistant experts, characterized by confidence degrees provided by the initial expert, will express their uncertainty concerning value nodes in the same way of the initial expert. In fact, they will provide possibility distributions relative to each consequence and each utility.</p><p>To evaluate these multi-souce possibilistic influence diagrams, we have proposed an indirect evaluation method based on a processing phase of possibility distributions and on the evaluation algorithm already proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The proposed approach, has been implemented in a Possibilistic Influence Diagram Toolbox (PIDT) which can be seen as a decision support system.</p><p>A direct improvement of our proposal concerns multi-source possibilistic IDs with several value nodes to deal with multi objective decision problems when uncertainty is modeled in a possibilistic setting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>an optimistic behavior characterized by uncertainty attraction. • if T H = 0.5 then E 0 has a neutral behavior. Example 1: Let us consider the simple decision problem represented by the possibilistic ID of figure 1 containing 3 chance nodes (A, B, C), 1 decision node (D) and 1 value node (V ). Possibility distributions for the chance nodes are presented in table I.</figDesc></figure>

Thus S 1 = s11+s12+s13 3 = 0.516. In the same manner we have S 2 = 0.75. Then, the weighted similarity measures are computed as follows: S 1 = α 1 * S 1 = 0.7 * 0.516 = 0.361 S 2 = α 2 * S 2 = 0.3 * 0.75 = 0.225</figDesc></figure>
