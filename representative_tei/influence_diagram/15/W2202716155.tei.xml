<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>One of the options to close the nuclear fuel cycle is to dispose of the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in a permanent geological repository. However, before the repository is identified and approved for use, the continued safe storage until final disposition of SNF is a challenge to the nuclear industry. The SNF are initially placed in SRNL-STI-2015-00680 page 2 storage pools (wet storage) for sufficient time to allow cooling via radioactive decay and then transferred to dry cask storage facilities. The present licensing basis for dry cask storage is up to 60 years (20-year initial license and 40-year re-license) but longer storage times may become necessary as the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) evaluate repository options in a once-through strategy, and/or reprocessing options under modified open cycle or full recycle strategies. In clarification of the regulatory basis for continued storage, the NRC has recently established the rule for Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that will allow, in principle, re-licensing of storage systems for many additional decades.</p><p>Many Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs) are located near the coastal regions. Because the stainless steel canisters in these dry storage systems were not stress relieved for the welding residual stress, chloride induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) might take place under temperature and humidity conditions with marine salt and other atmospheric deposit contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. When this crack grows to approach the instability crack size, it will compromise the safety-credited containment boundary of the storage system such as the multipurpose canisters (MPC).</p><p>Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) or non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are being developed to deploy sensors through the narrow annular space in the dry cask system to detect service-induced planar and nonplanar flaws (e.g., cracking and pitting) on the surface of the canister. Flaw acceptance criteria are needed for the disposition of the inspection results should relevant indications be found. Recently, instability crack lengths and depths were reported for through-wall and part-through-wall cracks in these canisters <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The analysis was based on ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XI <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with a limit load approach which depends on the material's minimum tensile properties as provided by the ASME Section II <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The welding residual stress was not considered.</p><p>In a previous paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the development of a fracture mechanics-based flaw evaluation protocol to establish flaw stability criteria for these canisters was outlined, based on the API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 codified procedure for Fitness-for-Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> with the failure assessment diagram (FAD) methodology. That protocol is applied in the current analysis. The welding residual stresses for the longitudinal or axial (seam) weld and for the circumferential (girth) weld, respectively, are estimated based on API 579 recommendation since the welding parameters are proprietary information and hence are not available for this analysis. For a direct comparison of the flaw tolerance results, the loading conditions, tensile properties (Type 304 stainless steel), and the (bounding) flaw configurations are selected identically to those in Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The geometry of the Holtec HI-STORM canister <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref> is used for the current work. Because the FAD is used in the development of flaw stability criteria, the fracture toughness (K IC ) of the material is needed and is obtained through API 579 recommendation with a reference to the material test data obtained previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</p><p>It was found that when the residual stress is included as part of the loading, and with the consideration of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics through the FAD formulation, the resulting instability crack sizes have been page 3 significantly reduced from those based on the net section yielding limit load approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The results are reported in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONSTRUCTION AND LOADING OF MPC</head><p>Various canister designs have been used to store fuel at ISFSIs. In the present work, a typical cask system, Holtec International Storage Module, (HI-STORM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref> is selected for the calculation of instability crack sizes in the development of acceptance criteria for structural integrity assessment. This MPC is a cylindrical shell with all components made of austenitic stainless steel (Typically, 304 stainless steel) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The height of the canister is 4.8 m (15.8 ft) with an outer diameter 1.73 m (5.7 ft) and the thickness of the shell is 1.27 cm (0.5 in.).</p><p>The cylindrical shell is constructed with a circumferential (girth) weld in the mid-height and four axial seam welds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The upper and lower axial welds are offset slightly along the circumferential weld. The shell is welded to a bottom plate with a thickness of 6.35 cm (2.5 in.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Submerged arc welding (SAW) with full penetration is applied. Although the post-weld nondestructive inspection is carried out, the heat treatment to relieve the welding residual stress is not required for the construction. The flaw stability criteria will be developed for postulated cracks in the heat affected zone (HAZ) in these critical locations.</p><p>The fuel assemblies are loaded vertically into HI-STORM canister. The total weight of the loaded canister is about 36 metric tons or 40 tons (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref>). The closure welds in the lid region were not considered in the MPC failure assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> because 1) the tungsten inert gas (TIG) welds in the lid region are tougher than the submerged arc welds in the canister shell and the baseplate; 2) the multiple layers of welds (between the closure ring and shell; and between the lid and shell) provide redundant safety features for the lid, and 3) the lower stresses are expected in the lid. Therefore, flaw stability criteria are not developed for closure welds.</p><p>The loading conditions that are used to evaluate flaw stability by calculating the instability crack sizes are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref>. Both normal and accident conditions are included, and are identical to those employed in a previous flaw tolerance analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> based on limit load <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FRACTURE METHODOLOGY</head><p>The initiation and growth of stress corrosion cracks, in particular, CISCC, as postulated on the external surface of an austenitic stainless steel canister in the HAZ is elastic-plastic in nature. The welding residual stress is expected to play an important role in the subcritical crack growth until the instability length (for a through-wall flaw) or depth (for a part-through-wall flaw) is reached. To include all the contributory factors in the development of flaw disposition technology, it appears that API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Fitness-For-Service code <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is an appropriate choice. It is emphasized that citation of this code does not imply that it is the adopted code of record for flaw disposition for the canisters at ISFSIs.</p><p>API 579 recommends that Level 3 Assessment be used if subcritical crack growth is possible while the structural component is in service. The Level 3 Method A Assessment requires that the use of the Level 2</p><p>Assessment procedure and the FAD with user specified Partial Safety Factors based on risk assessments, which are unavailable for the current analysis. It was then decided that the Level 2 Assessment be conducted to establish the flaw stability criteria, and to defer the extra requirements to meet the Level 3 Assessment (e.g., user specified Partial Safety Factors) for future work, or to properly adjust the inspection results when the indication is found by inservice inspection. This deviation from the code allows a direct comparison of the results between the API 579 FAD approach and the limit load approach used in Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where the safety factors were not applied.</p><p>The main components of API 579 approach are the determination of the welding residual stress and the formulation of the failure assessment diagram. These are discussed in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Welding Residual Stress</head><p>Four flaw configurations (Figs. UTS, is not used.

Welding Parameters -API 579 Annex E <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> provides estimation equations for calculating the membrane and bending components of the residual stress. The key input parameter is the heat input density (𝑄𝑄 � ), which is a function of linear heat input to the weld 𝑞𝑞̇= (𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼)/𝑢𝑢, where I is the welding electric current, V is the welding voltage, and 𝐼𝐼 is welding arc efficiency, and u is the welding travel speed. However, these parameters are proprietary information and are not for public dissemination. Therefore, from API 579 Annex E, Table <ref type="table">E</ref>.1M <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a suggested value of 1080 J/mm is selected as the average heat input in the analysis. This average heat input was based on a 4 mm electrode, 889 mm/min travel speed, with 500A-32V for stainless steel with submerged arc welding. The code <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>   Eqs.

The direction of x will be reversed (denoted as x' as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>) when an external surface crack is considered (x'=0 at the external surface of the cylinder). The first two terms in the expression for D are the membrane and bending components, respectively, and the last two terms (A and B)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 𝐾𝐾 -|𝜎𝜎 � 𝑚𝑚 𝑟𝑟 | -|𝜎𝜎 � 𝑏𝑏 𝑟𝑟 |, 𝑘𝑘 𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟 = 0.25𝑘𝑘 0 𝑟𝑟 ,</formula><p>represent the self-equilibrating component.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>), are shown in Figures <ref type="figure">2 to 5</ref>. These figures also show the variations of the linear and the self-equilibrating parts of the residual stress through the thickness of the canister wall. Each of the residual stress (RS) distribution is fitted with a fourth order polynomial (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>), and its coefficients (σ 0 , σ 1 , σ 2 , σ 3 , and σ 4 ) can be used to calculate the stress intensity factor based on API 579 Annex C Compendium of Stress Intensity</p><p>Factor Solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) in a later section) because of convenience as how the equations are written.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAILURE ASSESSMENT DIAGRAMS (FAD)</head><p>The original failure assessment diagram (FAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> is a crack growth resistance curve in terms of the stress or load ratio, L r (abscissa), and the stress intensity factor or toughness ratio, K r (ordinate). The stress ratio L r is defined as the ratio of the applied load (P) to a reference load (P o ), which is the limit load based on net section yielding. To better reflect material behavior under strain hardening, Ainsworth <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> redefined L r by introducing a reference stress from the primary load as 𝜎𝜎 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝 = (𝑀𝑀/𝑀𝑀 0 )𝜎𝜎 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 . Therefore, the abscissa for the FAD becomes (API 579 Part 9, Eq. 9.17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) </p><p>API 579 also suggests a modified form for the ordinate of the FAD (K r ). A plasticity interaction factor, Φ, is introduced as a function of 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 (the L r value defined above for the primary load) and 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 (the L r value based on the secondary load, which in the current case is the residual stress). The details can be found in API 579 Part 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The modified form for the ordinate is (API 579 Part 9, Eq. 9.26)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 = 𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑃𝑃 +𝚽𝚽𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐾𝐾 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑃𝑃 is the stress intensity factor from the primary load, 𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 is the stress intensity factor from the secondary load (e.g., residual stress), and 𝐾𝐾 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 is the fracture toughness of the material.</p><p>The API 579 FAD methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> recommends several versions of material curve for various levels of assessment. These curves are referred as "FAD failure curve," or "FAD failure envelope," or simply "FAD" (in Part 9 of API 579). Any assessment point with coordinates (𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 , K r ) below the FAD failure curve, the associated crack is mechanically stable; while at the assessment point above the curve is mechanically unstable at the given load and the crack size. Therefore, this flaw is considered unacceptable. A typical FAD is shown in API 579 Part 9, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For API 579 Level 2 and Level 3 (Method A) Assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the FAD failure curve is defined by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 = [1 -0.14(𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 ) 2 ]{0.3 + 0.7 𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑥𝑒𝑒[-0.65(𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 ) 6 ]} (4)</formula><p>for 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 ≤ 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟(𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑥𝑥) 𝑃𝑃 .

The values of 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 and 𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 , for the current analysis, are calculated with the residual stress distributions across the thickness of the canister shell where the crack is located (see Figs. 2 to 5 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>).</p><p>The yield stress of the material for this analysis is 205 MPa (30 ksi) which is based on the ASME minimum yield strength for 304 stainless steel <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>  and the HAZ along C-L and L-C directions were reported for Type 304 stainless steel large diameter piping joined with Type 308 stainless steel weld filler <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. The lowest fracture toughness at 125 °C for the HAZ is K JC = 207 MPa√m, where K JC is converted from J IC obtained from the J-R curve testing with 0.394T-CT specimens in C-L direction. However, at that temperature only two samples were tested and the data range was large: 175-239 MPa√m . Therefore, the fracture toughness for the current FAD analysis adopts the recommendation from API 579 Annex F Materials Properties for a FFS Assessment, Section 4.8.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, from which the base metal 𝐾𝐾 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 = 220 MPa√m (or 200 ksi√in) is chosen since the flaws are assumed to be initiated in the HAZ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference Stress and Stress Intensity Factor Solutions</head><p>The calculations of the reference stress and the stress intensity factor for four crack configurations depicted in Figs. 2 to 5 are described in subsequent sections. The equations are reproduced from API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Only the main equations are listed here. For consistency, the parameter symbols are adopted exactly as those used in API 579 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Care must be taken because the same symbol may be defined differently for different crack configurations considered in API 579 Annexes C and D, respectively, for stress intensity factor and reference stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the equations reported in this paper are selected from API 579 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for best use with the loading conditions in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref>. Therefore, the loadings involve only the internal pressure (p), the deadweight (normal), and the axial handling or acceleration (accident). The net section bending moments (M) and the crack face pressure (p c ) are not considered and therefore they are set to zero. However, it should be noted that the welding residual stress does have a bending component and appropriate equations must be used. As discussed earlier, the residual stress is typically expressed as a fourth order polynomial (e.g., Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>), or represented by the combination of a membrane and a bending stress (e.g., Eqs. 11 and 12).</p><p>(</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETERMINATION OF CRACK STABILITY</head><p>Only bounding flaw configurations are considered in the present work for evaluating flaw stability for the MPC. These flaw configurations are: axial through-wall crack, circumferential through-wall crack, axial partthrough-wall crack, and 360° circumferential part-through-wall crack. These cracks are all assumed to initiate in the HAZ near the axial (seam) weld or the circumferential (girth) weld. Each of the flaw configuration and its relative location with respect to the neighboring welds are illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure">2 to 5</ref>. The instability crack sizes (depth or length) are calculated with the given loading conditions in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref> corresponding to a typical spent nuclear fuel multipurpose canister (HI-STORM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crack Assessment Locus</head><p>For a given crack size (i.e., the crack length of a through-wall flaw or the crack depth for a part-through-wall flaw) and a set of external loads and welding residual stress, the coordinates (𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 , K r ) for crack instability evaluation with FAD can be calculated based on the reference stress and the stress intensity factor solutions discussed in previous sections. This section describes the construction of a crack assessment locus by gradually page 18</p><p>increasing the crack size under the same loading condition. As depicted by Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, a FAD failure curve defined by Eq. 4 is first plotted. Any assessment point (𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 , K r ) below this curve is safe and above is unsafe. In this section the most limiting crack configuration is used for demonstration, that is, an axial through-wall crack with length 2c. When the residual stress is not considered or it has been relieved by post-weld heat treatment, a "sampling" crack with length 100 mm subject to normal operating loads (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref>) is stable, as shown by the locus in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> labeled as "Normal No RS." When the crack length is gradually increased, the assessment locus eventually intersects the FAD failure curve (Eq. 4) at 2c= 690 mm. At this point the critical crack length is defined as 690 mm, beyond which the crack will become unstable under normal operation condition. Similarly, when the residual stress in the direction parallel to the circumferential weld is included (to open the axial cracksee the inset in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) and the canister is under normal operating condition, the instability crack length is estimated to be 118 mm by the assessment locus labeled as "Normal with RS." Under the accident loading condition and with the presence of residual stress (locus labeled as "Accident with RS"), the instability crack length is reduced to 88 mm. These instability crack lengths are reported as part of Table <ref type="table">3</ref> for the axial throughwall flaws.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, for this axial through-wall crack, the failure mode of "Normal with RS" appears to be within the range of "Zone 1 Fracture (Elastic) Controlled" as illustrated by Fig.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.1 (FAD) in API 579</head><p>Annex D <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The failure mode for the locus "Accident with RS" is moving away from the K-dominant elastic regime and it appears to be a borderline Zone 2 Fracture (Elastic-Plastic) and Collapse Controlled."</p><p>Furthermore, when the residual stress is not considered and the normal operating load is applied ("Normal No RS"), the failure mode is unmistakably elastic-plastic controlled, which is typical for austenitic stainless steel structures. Note that the boundaries between these zones shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">D</ref>.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is somewhat arbitrary.</p><p>Nevertheless, this demonstration has shown that the residual stress will have profound influence on the instability crack length as well as the failure mode (brittle or ductile). For the canister loading given in , the symbol that is mostly used in API 579 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and in this paper.</p><p>It is highlighted that the API FAD approach and assumptions used in this present analysis to estimate instability crack sizes in canisters with welding residual stress is very conservative. It is assumed that the constant residual stress distribution acts on the crack over its entire length or depth, regardless of how long or how deep the crack is, even for the case where the crack has already extended beyond the region dominated by the residual stress. This stress distribution contributes to the value of 𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 , which is then added to 𝐾𝐾 𝐼𝐼 𝑃𝑃 (due to the page 19 primary loads such as those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref>) through a plasticity interaction factor Φ to give the total value of 𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 (see Eq. 3). As a result, 𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 increases rapidly with crack size. The conservatism is exacerbated if the through-wall residual stress distribution is overly estimated. In the present analysis, the residual stress is obtained by using API 579 Annex E procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> through a conservative assumption for the heat input density parameter 𝑄𝑄 � .</p><p>With the residual stress loading the crack, 𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 (the ordinate of the FAD) rises rapidly with crack size and eventually intesects the FAD failure curve defined by Eq. 4, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. That is, the instability condition is met quickly whereas there is only by a small change of 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 as the crack increases in size. This rapidly increasing 𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 , having a steep slope with respect to 𝐿𝐿 𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃 , is also responsible for pushing the assessment locus to the Zone 1 regime in the FAD. This is an artifact due to the application of the API procedure because stainless steels are well known as ductile and tough materials. The true assessment points for a stainless steel with an increase in flaw size should most likely traverse within the Zone 2 or Zone 3 in the FAD, as demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> by the assessment locus without residual stress. This finding illustrates the need for a realistic determination of residual stress, and perhaps to employ API Level 3 Method E Assessment (by analysis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Also note that the instability flaw size would depend on 𝐾𝐾 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 , which in the present analysis is a constant value (220 MPa√m or 200 ksi√in). If the API 579 Level 3 Method D (Part 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) were adopted, then the equivalent material toughness at each assessment point would be converted from the test data on the J-R curve as recommended by API 579 Annex F <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Because the J-R curve can typically be expressed by a power law in terms of crack size increment, the 𝐾𝐾 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) is no longer a constant, but is a monotonically increasing function of crack size but with a decreasing slope. By that API procedure (Level 3 Method D), the resulting assessment locus would exhibit a "fish hook" shape as shown in API 579 Part 9, Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.21 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where the 𝐾𝐾 𝑟𝑟 first decreases to a minimum value and then increases. The instability crack size in this case is then defined when the assessment curve is tangent to the FAD failure curve, or Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>). The reliable J-R curves for this material, especially in the HAZ, are not available at this time. Therefore, this option is not exercised in the present work.</p><p>The approach for the determination of instability crack length or depth in this paper is similar to that developed for the high level radioactive nuclear waste tanks at the U. S. DOE Savannah River Site (SRS) by Lam <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> and by Lam and Sindelar <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, in which various FAD methodologies were discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FLAW ACCEPTANCE LOGIC</head><p>The flowchart in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> represents a general approach for the flaw disposition. It should be noted that, when the depth (a) of a part-through-wall crack exceeds certain fraction of the shell thickness (t), the crack should be recategorized as a through-wall crack due to the uncertainties in sizing, and the high stress intensity at the crack tip leading to uncertainties in the elastic fracture mechanics evaluation to justify stability. When this occurs, the requirement for the through-wall instability for a crack with length (2c) must be met. This limit of applicability for the part-through-wall crack is tentatively set to a/t= 0.8, beyond which the elastic solution for the stress intensity factor becomes invalid. The frequency of inservice inspection will depend on the amount of subcritical crack growth (or crack growth rate), but it is outside the scope of the present work.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY AND PATH FORWARD</head><p>Tables 3 to 6 summarize the instability crack sizes developed in the current work with the failure assessment diagram approach. The results show significant effects from the welding residual stress, as well as the orientation of the crack with respect to the weld (and consequently to the direction of the residual stress). It was found that the most limiting lengths for a through-wall axial crack are 118 mm (under normal operating condition) and 88 mm (under accident or off-normal condition), and these constitute only about 10% of the crack lengths proposed earlier through a limit load approach without considering welding residual stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Similarly, for a through-wall circumferential crack, the most limiting lengths are 160 mm (normal) and 141 mm (accident), and are about 5% of the earlier reported values. These circumferential crack lengths correspond to very small crack angles about 10°. These new estimates of the instability crack lengths based on FAD severely limit the flaw tolerance when the flaw penetrates the shell thickness and becomes through-wall. For part-through-wall flaws, the severity may be less impacted. The most limiting crack depths for a very long axial part-though-wall crack are 51% and 43% of the shell thickness, respectively, for normal and accident conditions. These crack depths are about 60% of the previously proposed values. In the case of a circumferential part-though-wall crack that circumvents around the entire canister (360°), the most limiting crack depths are 61% (normal) and 56%</p><p>(accident) of the shell thickness. They are about 70% of the values based on net section yielding without residual stress.</p><p>For a more accurate flaw stability analysis, a semi-elliptic crack configuration should be considered to calculate the instability crack depth for a surface crack. Since additional parameters are needed to define the crack front (crack length and crack depth), the calculation based on API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> becomes much more complicated, but is still feasible. It is expected that the flaw stability criteria based on the semi-elliptic cracks with a FAD approach would be less limiting (i.e. would show larger stable crack sizes) than the ones developed here with extreme bounding configurations (e.g., an infinitely long axial surface crack and a full-360° circumferential surface crack).</p><p>It has been shown that the welding residual stress acting on crack significantly affects the instability crack size, and welding residual stresses should be included in the analysis as a secondary load (stress). This leads to a conclusion that a more accurate welding residual stress should be used in developing the flaw disposition acceptance criteria. Therefore, more information on the weld geometry (such as single-or double-V notches)</p><p>and the actual welding parameters (such as the electric current, voltage, electrode travel speed, and the number of passes) used in canister fabrication would enable a more accurate estimation of residual stress. Finally, the loadings must be clearly defined for various types of canisters, and the canister-specific flaw stability criteria could be developed.</p><p>page <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25</ref> A comprehensive approach for the determination of accurate flaw stability with residual stress should consider a full set of numerical analyses that includes welding simulation and fracture mechanics analysis (such as Lam et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>). In addition, the residual stress redistribution at crack initiation and subsequence growth will have various degrees of influence on the J-integral based fracture criterion, depending on the relative magnitudes of the residual stress and the applied stress, as recently shown by Zhu <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. These analytical approaches are categorized under API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 Level 3 Method E Assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instability Crack Size</head><p>The flaw size obtained at the intersection point of the assessment locus and the FAD failure curve (Eq. 4) as discussed in previous section is defined as the instability crack length or depth for a crack under a given load with or without welding residual stress. The results are summarized in Tables <ref type="table">3 to 6</ref>. The flaw tolerance determined previously by Chu <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> using limit load or net section yielding approach is also included for comparison purpose.</p><p>A significant reduction in the instability crack size can be seen by the inclusion of welding residual stress in the analysis with the framework of FAD, which covers the full range of material deformation modes from purely elastic to elastic-plastic and finally the perfectly plastic collapse failure.  Note: An asterisk "*" denotes the limiting instability crack length for each of the crack-weld configuration.   </p></div>
