<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The longer a software or computer system service is down, the more it costs the IT organization and the more frustrated users become. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that are responsible for the high-resolution timekeeping capabilities in responding to System Downtime or Outages. A Lean Six Sigma DMAIC framework is often used in large software companies to improve the speed at which incidents are resolved. This framework follows the DMAIC methodology, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The study discusses the potential use of the Six Sigma methodology to improve the efficiency of an IT incident management process. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to analyze the results obtained from the company's case study. The analysis showed that the use of both methods was beneficial. Results show the main reasons for the high MTTR are the availability of the Engineers or Specialists for functional escalation and the skill set of these individuals. This constraint gives a major factor for the delay in the acknowledgment of paging alerts, leads to subsequent reassignments of the critical ticket to another person until someone is available to go online and respond, and contributes highly to resolution time. To improve the high-accuracy time and identify the influencing factors, a causeand-effect diagram and data analysis were performed using recorded incident tickets that were flagged as a critical or system-wide issues. The statistical analysis of the obtained results showed which factors influence the effectiveness of the process. A predictive model of the DMAIC methodology was developed to help predict the resolution time of incident tickets at a company. This model helps to quantify how other factors (such as the severity of the incident, the number of involved parties, and the amount of information available) affect the length of time it takes to resolve an incident.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Six Sigma is a system of quality management practices that aims to identify and eliminate defects (items that are not part of the intended population). It has been widely adopted by businesses as an essential component of quality assurance programs. The process of reducing defects below 3.4 per million opportunities was pioneered by <ref type="bibr">Bill Smith at Motorola in 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( (Smith &amp; Mobley 2008)</ref>. The Lean Six Sigma methodology is a data-driven process used in the design, improvement, and management of processes and systems. It helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these systems by identifying and correcting problems early <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dasig 2017)</ref>. In this paper, a case study of an IT company that is known for providing computer-based financial data and analysis for financial professionals requires the Technology experts' personnel or Technical Solutions Engineers (TSE) to meet the demands of clients' queries reaching out on the helpdesk for technology-related assistance. Technical Solutions Engineers (TSE) primarily cover 24/7 support in handling calls, emails, and internal tickets from the client's all around the world. One of the most crucial scopes of support that the TSE team handles is to respond to and monitor the System Wide Emergency or outage incidents or tickets. Once the ticket has been tagged in a Critical status, it means a serious issue is defined as a problem (e.g., bug or incident, not an enhancement request) that is impacting a client or trial's company workflow to the point where existing or new revenue is at risk, typically totaling at least $100,000 (USD) ASV. The goal of the The main objective of this study is to enhance the service process for IT Incident Management with the aid of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC Methodology. Moreover, this study aims to analyze existing incident management workflows to determine critical roles and activities in responding to unplanned outages in responding to system-wide outages. Moreover, below are the specific objectives that will support systematically the desired output of the study: (1) Identify the stakeholder groups, activities, and process of incident management to identify the common factors that will control the resolution time (MTTR) of a critical ticket. (2) Perform statistical data analysis of the identified causes to test their significance. (3) Create a solution design from the identified statistically significant causes and implementation plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The literature review of well-known sources on ITIL and incident management focuses on how modern technologies can be used to manage incidents. <ref type="bibr">(Cornell 2021)</ref>. According to the systematic analysis, papers from these criteria can be classified into three main categories: process, people, and tools, which are critical issues for contemporary information technology service management <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ghazizadeh 2019)</ref>. There were three papers on how to automatically monitor and detect incidents in real time or on the cloud. There are three papers discussing methods for automatically detecting incidents on-demand or in the cloud. Some studies found that the most popular topic among automation enthusiasts is closing tickets. Another study looked into how machine learning can be used to help make recommendations automatically, to minimize errors. According to the literature analysis, Incident Managers' stakeholders mostly support technicians who respond to incidents. It is suggested that mathematical algorithms (such as ML algorithms) be used to optimize resource allocation throughout the day to save downtime costs.</p><p>Six Sigma concepts and techniques can be applied to many aspects of IT service management, but they are primarily focused on service quality management processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Radhakrishnan 2011</ref>) coined IT Service Management Process Improvement is a way to improve an organization's IT service management maturity and its Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) program. Service quality is determined by the quality of people, processes, information, and technology, as well as the maturity of service quality management systems. The management of service quality is critically dependent on effective IT processes. Radhakrishnan believes that Fishbone diagrams can help identify and analyze potential causes of service issues. He has found that they are useful tools for understanding the root causes of problems and can help to find solutions. Typically, fishbone diagrams are used to identify service issues and to better understand the flow of service requests. In this case, we are using them to understand the availability of services. The fishbone diagram is a great way to visualize the different parts of a service and how they are connected. It can help you see how the various parts work together and how they are related to one another. Fishbone diagrams and analysis can help identify and analyze potential causes for service outages. Fishbone diagrams can help to identify which areas may be causing the service to be unavailable and can help to analyze what may be causing the service to be unavailable. Service availability and service unavailability are influenced by a variety of factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>To minimize the MTTR, a study followed a DMAIC framework that provided structure and guidance for developing an understanding of how the output will be designed. This framework consisted of a series of steps that helped to create a clear understanding of how the output will be constructed. For the Define phase, Historical data was recorded from the Previous Fiscal year and quarter where the number of Critical Tickets and monitoring sheets was the primary basis for Hypothesis testing. For the Measure phase, ANOVA helps determine which factors are causing the variation in the measurements or if it is statistically significant or not. For the Analysis Phase, Analysis software was used to interpret the data and transform it into charts, tables, and figures for graphical and statistical analysis. For Improve procedures, Failure Mode, and Effects Analysis (FMEA) helps to identify tasks or features that are more likely to fail and identify processes that can be improved. Moreover, the Ease of Doing/Impact matrix was used to decide and consider how much effort it will take to do something and how much potential good it might achieve for the suggested resolutions. Lastly for Control phase, it helps us figure out what needs to be done to make sure our goals are being met. Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology used in the process improvement cycle for improving the design, optimization, and continual process and design management. A sigma is a statistical measure used to quantify the variability in a process also known as Standard Deviation. Six Sigma is a data-driven and disciplined approach to measuring and improving the organization's operational performance by identifying and eliminating "defects" in manufacturing and service-related processes <ref type="bibr">(Dasig 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Collection</head><p>Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with stakeholders of the company that were involved in responding to and monitoring the incident management. Each interview lasted between 45 mins to 1 hour. The first set of questions established the interviewee's role and responsibilities during a system-wide downtime scenario. The second set asked the interviewee to walk the researcher through the organization's response to a "high severity" ticket that has been tagged as critical while describing the organizational structure, coordination among teams, team dynamics, routine behaviors, reporting structure, and communication protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmad et al. 2021</ref>). Moreover, using data provided by the company, the proponent started with an overview of the company, such as its history, company objectives, and the nature of its business. For the quantitative data, the recorded historical data was recorded from the Previous Fiscal year and quarters and the number of Critical Tickets and monitoring sheets was the primary basis for Hypothesis testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Case Study (DMAIC Methodology Application)</head><p>In this study, only tickets that were categorized and alerted as Critical will undergo Data analysis as it was filed due to significant degradation of FactSet platform reliability. The historical average number of Critical ticket escalations from the recent Fiscal Year to date of FactSet was 169, which accumulated 83,998 total minutes and is equivalent to 8.28 MTTR(FY). While from the recent Fiscal quarter (April-July) we have already recorded 58 Critical tickets which have 29,121 total minutes and are equivalent to 8.37 MTTR(FQ). The management would like to control and minimize the MTTR from the recent Fiscal quarter of 8.37 MTTR(FQ) to a least low than 5. The MTTR can be computed using the formula below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MTTR = Total hours of downtime / Number of incidents</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Define Phase</head><p>In the Define Phase, a Project Charter was made to outline the overall process and overview and improvement of the project. It also serves as an agreement between management and the six-sigma team regarding the expected project outcome. SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customer) shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> identifies all relevant elements of a process improvement project before work begins and helps to define a complex project that may not be well-scoped (Juran 2018). Further in this phase, the Problem Definition Tree branches out more details about the problem and what the customer needs. These requirements must be translated into measurable product and process requirements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bisk 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Engineering and Operations Management Manila, Philippines, March 7-9, 2023</ref> © IEOM Society International Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows, that 96% of Critical Tickets are Non-Class A issues, 78% of Critical Tickets affect multiple regions and 78% of Critical Tickets affect multiple types of clients (firm). This concludes that regardless of Class, Region, or location, and some clients affected by the issue, the MTTR can be controlled. Further, an interview with a crossfunctional team was conducted to investigate the causes of high values of MTTR. The team comprised Engineers (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Product specialists, and Software Dev teams. The main causes and the sub-causes were as identified:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial</head><p>(1) People -Lack of knowledge on how to fix the problem. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>   In the work sampling approach, different pieces of data from saved monitoring sheets were used at certain times, instead of always using all the data. The interval is random to determine which task or component the Engineers spend the most time on by looking at how often and how long it showed up in each random sample. Begin by breaking the task down into smaller parts and record your times as you complete them. Each step in the process of responding to Critical alerts, from acknowledging them to standing down, was analyzed to see if there were any efficiencies to be found. From the root cause analysis that was discussed, the task was observed by asking questions to the affected team who is handling and acknowledging Critical or system-wide alerts. Through interviews, possible factors were broken down to identify causing of high MTTR c. 20 respondents from a different department that handles Critical or Systemwide time were asked "What factors do they think can drive high MTTR?", results show that 75 % of answers point that the main issue due to competency and knowledge in fixing the critical problem and the type of class service it belongs to, they believe it affects the resolution time. The escalation factor got the highest score of 90% which describes the acknowledgment time and availability of the relevant team to respond ASAP on the issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Measure Phase</head><p>To validate the measurement system, MTTR for each Critical ticket was computed automatedly in Excel. The total MTTR for each Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year was shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The metric of interest was the time to repair (MTTR) and diagnosed the issue of the ticket that was tagged as Critical. The source of data was the observation of records on when the ticket has been tagged or raised to Critical until the issue subsided or was fixed. Moreover, the source of data was the record entered into the database by the Emergency Curator Engineer (ECT1 / ECT2) in monitoring the Critical Ticket.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. MTTR Summary for the Previous Fiscal Year</p><p>The MTTR of each Critical Ticket from the previous Fiscal Quarter (FY) was used to provide the central value of a characteristic produced by the current process shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Problem Analysis was derived from the possible listed categories to determine the areas of focus and get a clear and shared understanding of the issue. Moreover, the Measured MTTR value from the previous FQ was used to interpret and determine if the process is under control. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the specification limits are LSL = 4 and USL = 8, and using the benchmark values for MTTR, the capability of the current process as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> below was proven that the Baseline is Poor.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Analyze Phase</head><p>From the process Map shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, a sequence of steps of the current as-is process was identified and a crossfunctional team was formed to investigate the causes of high values of MTTR. The team comprised clients, Engineers (ECT1 and ECT2), Product specialists, Software Dev team. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the cause-and-effect Diagram that identifies the potential and most likely causes of high MTTR. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Analyze Phase</head><p>Based on the root cause analysis, data were collected to validate the most likely potential causes -hypothesis tests were performed to determine if these causes are statistically significant and practically important to address the issue of high MTTR. Data shown in this section was based on the 58 documented Critical Monitoring sheets from the last Fiscal Quarter (FQ).</p></div>

This is mainly caused by the lack of supervision of senior team members who are not available to consult online. On the other hand, the problem in the escalation of Critical tickets to dedicated Engineers/Specialist to Respond to Paging Alerts become evident as the major cause of high MTTR. Aside from unavailability, there is no current rotational shifting for 24/7 coverage of each team to respond to System-wide emergencies or critical issues.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Improve Phase</head><p>For strategic prioritization ease of doing/impact matrix was created in finding the most impactful ideas that require the least amount of effort. The developed matrix shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref> was the product of the brainstormed actions across the involved team in responding to system-wide critical alerts. The activities were evaluated and rated in turn on how much they will impact the goal on a scale of one to ten, with one being not much and ten being a lot. Then three criteria with corresponding weights were used to measure the impact, ease, and risk of implementation. Based on the results 3 out of 8 got the highest scores which means those items are needed to be set as a high priority for implementation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Control Phase</head><p>To successfully achieve a goal in the long-term run, we must be able to measure progress. MTTR is the average time it takes for a tool or process to recover from any failure. The long-term sustenance plan below shows ground rules for using MTTR wisely from a long-term plan perspective shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">12</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and Conclusion</head><p>Six Sigma DMAIC methodology has been successful in improving the overall process to reduce the MTTR. This methodology focuses on continuous improvement and strives for continuous improvement. This continuous improvement leads to a shorter MTTR, which in turn leads to a more efficient and effective process. One important point to note in this case is that simple solutions were successful in achieving the desired results, without any additional cost or investment required from the company. The Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix table shows the ease of performing different actions and the impact those actions have. It is a helpful tool for decision-makers who want to know which actions are easiest and most effective. Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities is key to managing incident response and reducing MTTR in this study. The EOC is responsible for managing incidents and adapting and improving the process as necessary. ECT1 is a single point of contact for end users reporting service outages. This group is responsible for classifying incidents and routing them to the appropriate second-line support personnel if the first-line support is unable to resolve the incident. They also monitor repair activities and update users on the incident status. ECT2 technicians typically have more advanced knowledge than first-line support staff. This is because ECT2 technicians have undergone additional training in the field. First-line support staff, on the other hand, are typically less experienced than ECT2 technicians. Therefore, frontline support personnel may be enlisted to help with incidents that first-line support can't resolve. And the Product Specialist and Software Dev Support responders are the main ones responsible for interacting with third-party software or hardware vendors to help quickly restore normal service.</p><p>From the Statical Data Analysis, it was proven that the selected factors can diminish the hours in resolving systemwide incidents tickets and their impact are significantly relevant in lowering the MTTR. Further, through formulated Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, we can assure that the implementation plan will be successful as highlights the prioritizing of actions, and risks, and develops countermeasures. Refresher training can help prevent one of the most dangerous incident-response risks: situations in which only one person knows a particular system or technology. Overall, the long-term sustenance plan in lowering the MTTR for this study is to continuously improve the quality monitoring, Leverage AIOps capabilities, Create Centralize SOPs, and Random reviewing and follow-up on previous Critical tickets, this will contribute to maintaining lowering the MTTR and creates best-in-class incident response process of the company. The forecast gives the overall possible MTTR of 4.7102. This is 1.55 lower than the Fiscal Quarter and the desirable value was met as the MTTR is lower than 5.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
