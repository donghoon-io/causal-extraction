<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper analyzed the influence of water exchange on spatial distribution of Hg in Jiaozhou Bay China based on investigation data on Hg in surface waters in April, July and October 1988. Results showed that Hg contents in surface waters in April, July and October 1988 were 0.045-0.100 μg L -1 , 0.031-0.064 μg L -1 and 0.024-0.104 μg L -1 , respectively. The two major Hg sources in Jiaozhou Bay were overland runoff and river flow, whose source strengths were 0.068-0.104 μg L -1 and 0.061-0.074 μg L -1 , respectively. A block diagram model was provided to reveal the changing of Hg contents during migration processes, i.e., human emission, overland transport, river flow transport and oceanic transport. Hg in Jiaozhou Bay was mainly input from major sources located in the west, north and east of the bay, and Hg contents in the bay were relative high. However, Hg contents in the open waters were still relative low. Hence, by means of water exchange, there was a equivalent peak surface (0.050 μg L -1 ) in the bay. These findings were showing the influence of water exchange on Hg contents in this semi-closed bay.</p></div>

This paper analyzed the influence of water exchange on spatial distribution of Hg in Jiaozhou Bay China based on investigation data on Hg in surface waters in April, July and October 1988, and to provide basis for the research and pollution control countermeasures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study area and data collection 2.1 Study area</head><p>Jiaozhou Bay is located in the south of Shandong Province, eastern China (35°55′-36°18′ N, 120°04′-120°23′ E), and is connected to the Yellow Sea in the south. The total area and average water depth are 446 km2 and 7 m, respectively, yet the width of the bay mouth was only 3 km. This bay is a semi-closed bay. There are a dozen of rivers including Dagu River, Haibo Rriver, Licun Rriver, and Loushan Rriver etc., all of which are seasonal rivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data collection</head><p>The investigation on Hg in surface waters in Jiaozhou Bay was carried on in in April, July and October 1988. There were 13 sampling sites in <ref type="bibr">April and July 1988 (i.e., 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88</ref>, 89 and 90), and were 6 sampling sites in October 1988 (i.e., 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Contents and pollution levels of Hg</head><p>Hg contents in surface waters in April, July and October 1988 were 0.045-0.100 μg L-1, 0.031-0.064 μg L-1 and 0.024-0.104 μg L-1, respectively. In according to Guidelines for Hg in Sea Water Quality Standard (GB3097-1997) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), the pollution level of Hg in surface waters in different months in 1988 were generally ranging from Class I to III. In April 1988, high values of Hg contents were in Sites of 32, 33, 84, 86, 87, 89 and 90, in where Hg contents were 0.050-0.100 μg L-1 and were belong to Class II to III, yet in the bay center, bay mouth and open waters were lower than 0.050 μg L-1 and were belong to Class I. In July 1988, high values of Hg contents were in Sites of 33, 89 and 90 in the estuary of Haibo River, in where Hg contents were 0.053-0.064 μg L-1 and were belong to Class II to III, while in other positions were lower than 0.050 μg L-1 and were belong to Class I. In October 1988, high values of Hg contents were in Sites of 84, 86, 87 and 89, in where Hg contents were 0.068-0.104 μg L-1 and were belong to Class II to III, while in the bay center and the northeast of the bay were lower than 0.050 μg L-1 and were belong to Class I. In general, Hg contents in Jiaozhou Bay 1988 were showing seasonal and spatial variations, and the pollution level of Hg in surface waters in was slight to moderate. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Horizontal distributions and sources of Hg</head><p>In April 1988, high value of Hg contents was in Site 84 (0.100 μg L-1), and the high value center was in the coastal waters in the southwest of the bay, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the bay mouth (0.046 μg L-1) and the open waters (0.045 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), this indicated that overland runoff was the major source in this position. The other high value of Hg contents was in Site 87 (0.080 μg L-1) in April 1988, and the high value center was in the coastal waters in the northeast of the bay, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the bay mouth (0.045 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), this indicated that river flow was the major source in this position. The third high value of Hg contents was in Site 89 (0.061 μg L-1) in April 1988, and the high value center was in the estuary of Haibo River, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the bay mouth (0.045 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), this indicated that river flow was the major source in this position. In July 1988, high value of Hg contents was in Site 89 (0.064 μg L-1) in the estuary of Haibo River, and the high value center was in the estuary of Haibo River, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the inner side of the bay mouth (0.056 μg L-1), the bay mouth (0.040 μg L-1) and the open waters (0.033 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), this indicated that river flow was the major source in this position. In October1988, high value of Hg contents was in Site 86 (0.104 μg L-1), and the high value center was in the coastal waters in the west of the bay, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the bay center (0.024 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), this indicated that overland runoff was the major source in this position. The other high value of Hg contents was in Site 87 (0.068 μg L-1) in October 1988, and the high value center was in the coastal waters in the northeast of the bay, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the center of the bay (0.024 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), this indicated that river flow was the major source in this position. The third high value of Hg contents was in Site 89 (0.074 μg L-1) in October 1988, and the high value center was in the estuary of Haibo River, and Hg contents were decreasing from the high value center to the center of the bay (0.024 μg L-1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), this indicated that river flow was the major source in this position. In according to the horizontal distributions of Hg contents, it could be found that the two major Hg sources in Jiaozhou Bay were overland runoff and river flow, whose source strengths were 0.068-0.104 μg L-1 and 0.061-0.074 μg L-1, respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sourced input processes of Hg</head><p>Overland runoff and river flow were the two major Hg sources in Jiaozhou Bay, while the source strength of overland runoff was higher. This indicated the original source input of Hg to the land was relative high (0.068-0.104 μg L-1), and the Hg contents were delivered to rivers by rainfall-runoff, and was diluted to a lower level (0.061-0.074 μg L-1), and finally Hg contents were delivered to marine bay and Hg contents were further to a lower level (0.024-0.045 μg L-1). Jiaozhou Bay is a semi-closed bay which is surrounding by lands in the east, north, and west, and is connecting to open waters in the south via a narrow bay mouth. In generally, the major sources of Hg were all from land, while the sources were responsible in different seasons and positions. In April and October 1988, Hg in Jiaozhou Bay was mainly sourced from the west, north and east, and the source strength was 0.061-0.104 μg L-1. In July 1988 in Jiaozhou Bay, Hg in was mainly sourced from the east, and the source strength was 0.064 μg L-1. The sourced input process of Hg could be described in a block diagram model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Influence of water exchange on Hg</head><p>Marine bays are important palaces impacted by terrigenous matters, and the relevant researches were increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The terrigenous matters input to Jiaozhou Bay included both anthropogenic and natural matters. Anthropogenic matters included organic matters, heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons, etc., while natural matters included silicates etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. By means of advection transport and dilute diffusion, the contents of these matters were changing continuously. Hence, understanding the water exchange and its influence on the matters in marine bay is essential and has been one of the research hotspots <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Due to the impact of terrigenous matters, the contents of the matters in waters inside Jiaozhou Bay were relative high, while in open waters were relative low. By means of water exchange, current with low matter contents in the open waters was transported into the bay, and current with high matter contents inside the bay was transported to the open waters. Hence, there was forming a equivalent peak surface in the bay along with the continuous water exchange. This equivalent peak surface was revealing the influence of marine current from the open waters to matter contents inside the bay, and the temporal changing of this equivalent surface was revealing the water exchange process. For instance, the contour line of Hg contents in April 1988 was demonstrating the instantaneous frames of Hg contents during the water exchange process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). Once marine current with low Hg content was invading to the bay and was encountering with waters with high Hg content inside the bay, the water exchange was proceeding, and was resulting in a semi-closed tongue-shaped contour line (0.050 μg L-1) from the bay mouth to the center of the bay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). By means of this water exchange moving in cycles, Hg inside the bay was transported to the open waters via advection transport and dilute diffusion, and Hg contents in Jiaozhou Bay was decreasing continuously. The original source input of Hg to the land was relative high, and the Hg contents were delivered to rivers by rainfall-runoff, and was diluted to a lower level, and finally Hg contents were delivered to marine bay and Hg contents were further to a lower level. This sourced input process of Hg could be described in a block diagram model.</p><p>By means of water exchange, current with low matter contents in the open waters was transported into the bay, and current with high matter contents inside the bay was transported to the open waters.
