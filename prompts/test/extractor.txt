Your task is to read the full text of an academic paper and extract its primary causal model — that is, the network of theorized cause-and-effect relationships at the core of the paper's central research question.

[Definition]
The causal model you must extract is characterized by the following:
- Causal relationships: It depicts a network of cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., X affects Y).
- Directional flow: It uses arrows (directed edges) indicating the path of influence from cause to effect.
- Acyclicity: It represents a one-way flow of causality.
- Causal elements: The nodes and edges are based on the paper's description of its key variables, constructs, mediators, confounders, and proposed causal pathways or mechanisms.

[Rules]
1.  Synthesize from the full text: Synthesize all information from the provided paper text to create one comprehensive model.
2.  Extract structure only: Ignore all numerical values, statistical significance markers (e.g., *, p < .05), path coefficients, or explained variance. Focus only on the existence and direction of a relationship.
3.  Nodes: Each distinct variable or concept in the model should be a single node. Use concise but descriptive labels from the paper as the node `id` and `caption`.
4.  Edges: Represent a direct causal link from one node to another.

[Output format]
- Return your response in the following JSON format ONLY.

{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "<String: Unique identifier for the node, e.g., 'Socioeconomic Status'>", "caption": "<String: Display label for the node>" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "id": "<String: Unique identifier for the edge, e.g., 'e1'>", "from": "<String: ID of the source node>", "to": "<String: ID of the target node>", "caption": "<String: Optional label for the relationship>" }
  ]
}
