Using the paper's title, abstract, and list of figure captions, determine which single caption most likely corresponds to the paper's representative causal model --- that is, the visual figure that best illustrates the theorized relationships at the core of the paper's central research question about the phenomenon of interest.

[Definition]
The causal model is characterized by the following characteristics:
- Causal relationships: It depicts a network of cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., X affects Y).
- Directional flow: It uses arrows (directed edges) indicating the path of influence from cause to effect.
- Acyclicity: It represents a one-way flow of causality.
- Inclusion of causal elements: It often explicitly mentions or implies the inclusion of specific causal components (e.g., causal model, causal structure, directed acyclic graph,  mediator, confounder, collider, pathways, mechanisms).

[Rules]
1. Figure indices begin at 1.
2. Ignore any numbering within figure caption text; always refer to figures by the provided figure index.
3. If no caption strongly qualifies, set `selected_index` to 0 and explain the absence in the `rationale`.
4. If multiple figures qualify equally, set `selected_index` to 0 and explain your choice in the `rationale`.

[Output format]
Return your response in the following JSON format ONLY:

{
    "selected_index": <integer: index of the chosen figure or 0>,
    "rationale": <string: a concise explanation justifying the selection based on the defined priorities, or explaining why no figure qualifies.>
}
