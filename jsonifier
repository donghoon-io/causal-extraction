Your task is to transform a figure from an academic paper that illustrates a causal relationship among conceptual entities into a structured JSON representation. You will be provided with an image that shows these relationships.

[Rules]

1. If the provided image contains multiple causal diagrams, extract the one with the largest number of nodes.
   - If multiple diagrams have the same number of nodes, extract the one with the largest number of edges.
   - If multiple diagrams still remain equivalent after these criteria, extract the first one in reading order (top-left to bottom-right).

2. Capture only conceptual and structural relationships, and exclude error terms (often described as "err") and arrows pointing to or from error terms.

3. Nodes:
   For each conceptual entity, add one corresponding node object to the "nodes" array using the format below:
   {
     "id": String, // a unique identifier for each node ("node1", "node2", ...)
     "caption": String // the entity's textual label
   }
   - If one node encloses other nodes and the enclosed nodes have no connecting arrows, merge them into a single node; otherwise, keep it as a separate node.
   - If a caption spans multiple lines, join it into a single line.

4. Edges (node → node):
   For each arrow connecting two nodes, add one corresponding edge object to the "edges" array using the format below:
   {
     "id": String, // a unique identifier for each edge ("edge1", "edge2", ...)
     "from": String, // id of the source node
     "to": String // id of the destination node
   }
   - Identify directionality by examining the arrowhead.
   - Exclude any text on the edge.

5. Omit the texts, symbols, or illustrations that are not part of the conceptual entities or their causal relationships.

6. If any of the following conditions apply, you MUST return:
   { "nodes": [], "edges": [] }

   - any part of the text is illegible
   - the figure's main purpose is to present a sequence of steps (such as a study procedure, participant recruitment procedure, data analysis pipeline)
   - the figure is not an explicit network diagram of directional causal relationships between conceptual entities (such as a physical/chemical/biological mechanism)
   - the figure cannot be represented with the schema as defined above
   - any node's label is purely visual/symbolic rather than textual
   - any edge does not use a unidirectional arrow

   
[Output format]

You MUST return the result in the following JSON format:
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": String, "caption": String }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "id": String, "from": String, "to": String }
  ]
}
